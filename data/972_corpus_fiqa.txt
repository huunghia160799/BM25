your employers insurance premiums will definitely go up if there are a lot of claims when it is time for them to renew their policy it is also possible that if this happens the employer will pass along some of the additional cost to employees the insurance company will not try to have you removed it does n't work that way with group policies they just jack up the price as mentioned previously   if you take a new job your cancer will affect the future employer in the same way as to whether you should keep it a secret i do n't think it is something you have to disclose unless it affects your ability to perform your job even then it may be protected under the americans with disabilities act it is true that some employers could exhibit some bias because of this especially a small company that is likely to have a small group that is more likely to see price hikes because of a single employee making expensive claims bottom line i would n't lie about it to a future employer but i would n't volunteer that information either unless it is material to your job performance

many big companies self insure they pay the insurance company to manage the claims and to have access to their network of doctors hospitals specialists and pharmacies but cover the costs on a shared basis with the employees medium sized companies use one of the standard group policies small companies either have expensive policies because they are a small group or they have to join with other small companies through an association to create a larger group the bigger the group the less impact each individual person has on the group cost the insurance companies their policies each year based on the expected demographics of the groups the negotiated rates with the network of providers the required level of coverage and the actual usage of the group from the year if the insurance company does a poor job of estimating the performance of the group it hits their profits which will cause them to raise their rates the next year which can impact the number of companies that use them some provisions of the new health care laws in the us govern portability of insurance regarding preexisting conditions minimum coverage levels and the elimination of many lifetime cap prior to these changes the switching of employers while very sick could have a devastating impact on the finances of the family the lifetime cap could make it hard to cover the person if they had very expensive illnesses   if the illness does n't impact your ability to work there is no need to discuss it during the interview process it wo n't need to be discussed except while coordinating care during the transition there is one big issue though if the old company uses aetna and the new company does n't then you might have to switch doctors or hospitals or go out of network at a potentially even bigger cost to you

i do n't think so there is a provision in obamacare called community rating that applies starting in 2014 insurance companies must place individual and small group plans into a pool of people from the same geographical region the same plan must cost the same for all small businesses from the same region so having employees who have high costs will not significantly affect the company 's cost it will get factored into the cost for all people in the area but the effect gets averaged out over all businesses and individuals who have plans

2.5 whoa you are being robbed there   straight up stripped down and bent over a table robbed never agree to fees   if they do n't want to do the work to give you a loan there are other lenders who do rarely agree to points   if you know and i do n't mean think i mean know if you know that you are going to hold that loan much longer than it would take to repay those points then maybe   for example if they are charging one point to lower your rate 0.25 you want to be totally sure you will stay in the house at least four years and probably more like six or eight years before moving or refinancing it 's more or less ok to pay for the appraisal   if something goes wrong with the loan application the appraisal will be valid for a few more months you can try again i once had 14 cash for a down payment   the loan officer said if i could come up with 15 the rate would be reduced by 0.25   to get the money i took a reverse point which paid me 1 but raised my the rate by 0.25 the loan officer who was n't too bright asked why did you do that   the two things cancel each other out i did it i explained because you paid me 1 of the value of my house to sign my name twice

you are mixing issues here and it 's tough for members to answer without more detail the current mortgage rate in your country for one   it 's also interesting to parse out your question i wish to safely invest money should i invest in real estate but then the text offers that it 's not an investment it 's a home to live in this is where the trouble is and it effectively creates 2 questions to address   the real question buy vs rent i know you mentioned euros fortunately mortgages are n't going to be too different lower higher and tax consequence but all can be adjusted the new york times offered a beautiful calculator is it better to rent or buy   for those not interested in viewing it they run the math and the simple punchline is this the home rent ratio can have an incredibly wide range i 've read real estate blogs that say the rent should be 2 of the home value that 's a 4 to 1 home rent per year a neighbor rented his higher end home and the ratio was over 25 to 1 i.e. the rent for the year was about 4 the value of the home it 's this range that makes the choice less than obvious   the second part of your question is how to stay safely invested if you fear your own currency will collapse that quickly into too speculative a question some will quickly say gold and others would point out that a stockpile of weapons ammo and food would be the best choice to survive that

what 's the best strategy buy low and sell high now a lot of people try to do this a few are successful but for the most part people who try to time the market end up worse a far more successful strategy is to save over your entire lifetime put the money into a very low cost market fund and just let the average performance take you to retirement put another way if you think that there is an obvious no fail double your money due to a correction strategy you 're wrong otherwise everyone would do it and someone who tells you that there is such a strategy almost surely will be trying to separate you from a good amount of your money   in the end $ 80 k is n't a life altering never have to work again amount of money what i think you ought to do with it is pay off any credit card debts you may have pay a significant chunk of student loan or other personal loan debts you may have make sure you have a decent emergency fund set aside and then put the rest into diversified low cost mutual funds think of it as a nice leg up towards your retirement

as an aside why does it seem to be difficult to get a conclusive answer to this question i 'm going to start by trying to answer this question and i think the answer here will help answer the other questions   here is a incomplete list of the challenges involved so my question is is there any evidence that value investing actually beats the market yes there is a lot of evidence that it works and there is a lot of evidence that it does not   's has a great link on this   some rules methods work over some periods some work during others   the most famous evidence for value investing probably comes from fama and french who were very careful and clever in solving many of the above problems and had a large persistent data set but their idea is very different from damodaran 's for instance and hard to implement though getting easier is the whole field a waste of time because of the above problems this is a hard question   some people like warren buffet have clearly made a lot of money doing this   though it is worth remembering a good amount of the money these famous investors make is off of fees for investing other peoples money   if you understand fundamental analysis well you can get a job making a lot of money doing it for a company investing other peoples money   the markets are very random that it is very hard for people to tell if you are good at it and since markets generally go up it is easy to claim you are making money for people but clearly banks and hedge funds see significant value in good analysts so it is likely not entirely random especially if you are a good writer you can make a more money here than most other jobs is it worth it for the average investor saving for retirement   very very hard to say   your time might be better spent on your day job if you have one remember because of the fees and added risk involved over say index investing more trading is hazardous to your wealth

i do n't think there 's anything to worry about   does n't really care who 's paying as long as the loan is being paid as agreed   of course you 're helping your dad 's credit history and not your own but i doubt would give back money just because it came from your bank account a business may claim a payment was n't made against the loan but you 'd have the records that you did in fact pay keep those bank statements   in theory they could sue you in practice you 'd send them the proof and they 'd investigate and find the misplaced money   that does happen sometimes the wrong account is credited   if it did end up in court again you 'd win because you have proof you sent payments   even if you put the wrong loan account number to pay to you 'd have proof you in fact sent the money    if you 're talking about something like a loan shark they can do whatever they like   they wo n't sue you though because again you 'd have proof   that 's why they 'd use violence   but probably a loan shark would n't falsely claim you did n't pay if you did as word would get out and the loan shark would lose business   and again as long as they get what 's agreed to they do n't care how they get it or who they get it from

the odd thing about primary school education that i hear from talking to teachers is that the materials used in the classroom are all bought under some sort of district wide or even state wide in the case of texas decision for which program to use for reading they generally include a set of books or single book with a sequence of things to be taught teacher 's who 've been teaching for a long time will know which series has useful properties for teaching the material they might refer to them by names but it really just comes down to a set of materials and sequence of introducing material when one teacher says to another i used $ x to supplement the required $ y it 'd be like a software engineer saying i used a hash map instead of a map for that case because it had better performance for the use case there 's a fair amount of baggage in the statement but another software engineer would understand the differences and know what tradeoffs were being made   as to the master 's in reading there 's a lot of goofy degrees offered through the education departments at state schools a large part of it is because the union pay scales include things like education level they tend to be equivalent to any terminal masters program you 'd find in other subjects including mba take these classes part time and summers over the next 3 years and if you pass them all we give you a piece of paper that says masters of education reading or similar it comes down to something like 45 credit hours with a focus on something   gt basically he she just wants to work a program by a semi mindless rote and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them   i actually doubt that it 's going to come down to the sets of materials they have available for teaching some work some do n't the structure of the system discourages unfortunately and the teachers often feel that they have their hands tied

during a stock split the only thing that changes is the number of shares outstanding   typically a stock splits to lower its price per share   sometimes if a company 's value is falling it will do a reverse split where x shares will be exchanged for y shares   this is typically done to avoid being de listed from an exchange if the price per share falls below a certain threshold usually $ 1   again the only thing changing is the number of shares outstanding   a 20 for 1 reverse split means for every 20 shares outstanding the shareholder will be granted one new share example x co. has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 100 per share   it does a 1 for 10 split   now there are 10,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 per share example y co has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 1 per share   it does a 10 for 1 reverse split   now there are 100,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 quickly looking at the news for it looks like it a 20 for 1 reverse split   you should probably look at your statements and ask your broker how the arithmetic worked in your case investopedia links for reverse stock split and stock split

considering i 'm in a nearly identical situation i 'll speak to my personal strategy and maybe there 's some value for you as well    you have in loans which you say you could pay off today   so what i read is that you 're sitting there with a $ 22k investment and want to know which investment to make pay down debt invest in yourself start up or some variation between those options   any investor worth his salt will ask a couple of questions what is my risk and what is my gain paying off your student loans offers no financial risk at the cost of opportunity risk and gains you returns of 3.4 6.8 3.4 4.5 and 6.8   those percentage gains are guaranteed and the opportunity risk is unknown investing in a startup is inherently risky with the potential for big payoffs but with this investment you are accepting a lot of risk for potentially some gain it could be the next apple it could also fail   so with your situation like mine i 'd say it 's best to accept the easy investment for now and fully vet out your tech start up idea in the meantime

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

apparently only in america do people understand the difference between positive and negative rights   a negative right requires others to abstain from interfering with your actions   these are natural rights such as freedom of speech religion freedom from unreasonable search and etc   the constitution is full of negative rights that are by the creator i.e the government does not grant them to you but rather the government can not strip them from you because you already have them   positive rights require others to provide you with either a good or service such as healthcare   these rights always require government coercion such as forced taxation to implement   they also do n't exist without that government coercion   these rights are granted by government and can be taken away by government as well   americans are much more supportive of negative rights   true freedom means freedom from government coercion   thus calls for healthcare as a right are rejected by huge numbers of americans   healthcare is not a right in the same sense that freedom of speech is because it is not a negative right

i would prioritize paying off the heloc first    paying off the heloc has a guaranteed rate of return and will reduce the size of savings cushion you 'll need in the future however you should n't assume your heloc funds will remain available indefinitely    if you read your fine print you are not guaranteed access to your unused credit by the bank   if you lose your job or your home value significantly declines the bank could refuse to let you take more money out on your heloc    recently i 've seen people 's available credit be reset to 0 on open helocs by banks trying to reduce their exposure    planning on the future of available credit via a heloc is not a good safety net

title insurance protects you from losing rights to your property in case of a court decision let 's look at an example i recently found in local newspapers one old woman sold her apartment to person a. the deed was by a notary public who verified that indeed in was that old woman putting her signature on the deed then person a sold the apartment to person b etc then after several deals some unfortunate buyer bought that apartment the deal looked so he 's got a mortgage to pay for the apartment later it turned out that the old lady died three months before she sold the apartment and the notary public was corrupt old lady 's heirs filed a lawsuit and the deal was void so the ultimate buyer lost all rights to the apartment although he purchased it legally this is the case when title insurance kicks in you need one if there 's a chance for a deal to be deemed void

one of the reasons apart from historical is that different people have different tax liabilities which the employer may not be aware of for example in the us we do n't pay taxes in source on investment income and there are many credits and deductions that we ca n't take so if i have a child and some interest income from my savings account employer 's withholding will not match my actual tax liability there are credits for children additional taxes for the interest and the actual tax brackets vary based on my marital status and filing options i chose so even the same family of two people married will pay different amounts in taxes if they chose to file separate tax returns for each than if they chose to file jointly on one tax return for anyone who 've lived anywhere else like you and me this system is ridiculously complex and inefficient but for americans that works mainly for the reason of not knowing anything better and more importantly not wanting to know

reducing the lowest tax bracket to zero from ten and the next one to twelve from fifteen is a tax cut for the one percent   as someone on the cusp of one percent i 'd be paying more under trump 's plan   fortunately i 'm getting married and my wife does n't make as much as me so when we file together we 'll still get a break   it 's pretty sick how deficit spending only hurts the lower class and helps the one percent when there 's a republican on office   it 's also pretty sick how the author 's hypothetical spending cuts are to welfare as if there 's nowhere else in the budget that could be cut    the article is partisan nonsense   the tax cuts are directly to lower and middle class only     true there are massive corporate tax cuts but any individual getting money from a corporation is paying income tax on it   all a corporate tax does is reduce the amount of money the corporation has to invest in itself and its employees

interesting the answer can be as convoluted complex as one wishes to make it or back of envelope   my claim is that if one starts at 21 and deposits 10 of their income each year they will likely hit a good retirement nest egg at an 8 return each year keep in mind the last 40 years produced 10 even with the lost decade the 10 saver has just over their final income as a retirement account at 4 withdrawal this replaces 60 of their income with social security the rest to get to nearly 100 or so replacement note i wrote an article about social security benefits showing the benefit as a percent of final income at $ 50 k it 's 42 it 's a higher replacement rate for lower income but the replacement rate drops as income rises so the $ 5000 question for an individual earning $ 50 k or less this amount is enough to fund their retirement for those earning more it will be one of the components but not the full savings needed   by the way a single person has a standard deduction and exemption totaling $ in 2014 i refer to this as the zero bracket the next $ is taxed at 10 why go 100 roth and miss the opportunity to fund these low or no tax withdrawals

investopedia explains how a stock split impacts the stock 's options each option contract is typically in control of 100 shares of an underlying security at a predetermined strike price to find the new coverage of the option take the split ratio and multiply by the old coverage normally 100 shares to find the new strike price take the old strike price and divide by the split ratio say for example you own a call for 100 shares of xyz with a strike price of $ 75 now if xyz had a stock split of 2 for 1 then the option would now be for 200 shares with a strike price of $ if on the other hand the stock split was 3 for 2 then the option would be for 150 shares with a strike price of $ 50 so yes a 2 for 1 stock split would halve the option strike prices   also in case the investopedia article is n't clear after a split the options still control 100 shares per contract regarding how a dividend affects option prices i found an article with a good explanation as mentioned above dividends payment could reduce the price of a stock due to reduction of the company 's assets it becomes intuitive to know that if a stock is expected to go down its call options will drop in extrinsic value while its put options will gain in extrinsic value before it happens indeed dividends deflate the extrinsic value of call options and inflate the extrinsic value of put options weeks or even months before an expected dividend payment   extrinsic value of call options are deflated due to dividends not only because of an expected reduction in the price of the stock but also due to the fact that call options buyers do not get paid the dividends that the stock buyers do this makes call options of dividend paying stocks less attractive to own than the stocks itself thereby depressing its extrinsic value how much the value of call options drop due to dividends is really a function of its in the money call options with high delta would be expected to drop the most on ex date while out of the money call options with lower delta would be least affected if a stock is expected to drop by a certain amount that drop would already have been priced into the extrinsic value of its put options way beforehand this is what happens to put options of dividend paying stocks this effect is again a function of options but this time in the money put options raise in extrinsic value more than out of the money put options this is because in the money put options with delta of close to -1 would gain almost dollar or dollar on the drop of a stock as such in the money put options would rise in extrinsic value almost as much as the dividend rate itself while out of the money put options may not experience any changes since the dividend effect may not be strong enough to bring the stock down to take those out of the money put options in the money so no a dividend of $ 1 will not necessarily decrease an option 's price by $ 1 on the ex dividend date   it depends on whether it 's a call or put option and whether the option is in the money or out of the money and by how much

if the checking account is in a fdic insured bank or a ncua insured credit union then you do n't have to worry about what happens if the bank goes out of business in the past the government has made sure that any disruption was minimal the fraud issue can cause a bigger problem if they get a hold of your debit card they can drain your account yes the bank gives you fraud protection so that the most you can lose is $ 50 or $ 500 many even make your liability $ 0 if you report it in a timely manor but there generally is a delay in getting the money put back in your account one way to minimize the problem is to open a savings account it also has the fdic and ncua coverage the account may even earn a little interest if you do n't allow the bank to automatically provide an overdraft transfer from savings to checking account then the most they can temporarily steal is your checking account balance getting a credit card can provide additional protection it also limits your total losses if there is fraud the bill is only paid once a month so if they steal the card or the number they wo n't be able to drain the money in the bank account   the credit card if used wisely can also start to build a positive credit file so that in a few years you can get a loan for a car or a place to live of course if they steal your entire wallet with both the credit and the debit card

sounds you need to read up on s corp structures i think this would benefit you if you generate income even after you physically stopped working which is incomes from membership fees royalties of customer revenue middle man etc   under the you as the sole member must earn a wage that fair and at current market value you pay social security and medicare on this wage the interesting thing here is that an can pay out earning dividends   without having to pay payroll taxes but the catch is that you as the sole employee must earn a fair wage    as for paying the other member you may want to look into 1099 contract work plus a finders fee the 1099 hourly wage does not require you to pay medicare and ss    the common fee i 'm used to is 5 of gross invoice then you would pay her an hourly wage the company then bills these hours multiplied by 2 or 3 or whatever you think is fair to the client deduct expenses from this and that 's your profit    example contractor brings client a which is estimated as a   100 hour project with $ 100 cost in supplies and requires 2 hours of your time $    you quote 100 hours $ 50 to client client agrees and gives you down payment    you then present the contract work to your contractor they complete the work in 100 hours and bill you at $ 25    you pay your contractor 2500 plus the 5 $ 250   and your company earns $ 5000 2500 100 80   and you 'll earn $ 80 minus the payroll tax    then at the end of the quarter or year or however you want to do earning payouts your will write you a check for $ or whatever earning you want to take this is then taxed at your income tax bracket    one thing to keep in mind is what is preventing this other person from becoming your competition a partnership would be great motivation to try and bring in as much work under the llc but if you start people then they 'll just keep the work and cut you out

i 'm assuming that when you say convert to s corp tax treatment you 're not talking about actually changing your llc to a corporation there are two distinct pieces of the puzzle here first there 's your organizational form your state which is where the business is legally formed and recognized creates the llc or corporation s corp does n't come into play here your company is either an llc or a corporation there are a handful of other organizational types your state might have e.g. limited partnership etc none of these are immediately relevant to this discussion second there 's the tax treatment you receive by the irs if your company was created by the state as an llc note that the irs does n't recognize llcs as a distinct organizational type you elect to be taxed as an individual for single member llcs a partnership for multiple member llcs or as a corporation the former two elections are pass through there 's no additional level of taxation on corporate profits everything just passes through to the owners the latter election introduces a tax on corporate profits when you elect pass through treatment a single member llc files on schedule c a multiple member llc will prepare a form k-1 which you will include on your 1040 if your company was created by the state as a corporation not an llc you could still elect pass through taxation if your company qualifies under the rules in subchapter s i.e. an s corp states do not recognize s corp as part of the organizational process that 's just a tax distinction used by the irs and possibly your state 's tax authorities in your case if you are a single member llc and assuming there are no other reasons to organize as a corporation talking about s corp tax treatment does n't make any sense you 'll just file your schedule c in my experience it 's fairly simple note that this is based on my experience of and multiple member llcs in just two states your state may have different rules that affect state level taxation and the rules may change from year to year i 've found that hiring a good cpa to prepare the forms saves a good bit of stress and time that can be better applied to the business

there are a lot of reasons why institutional investors would own a company 's stock especially a lot of it some can be the company is in one of the indices especially big ones many asset management companies have funds that are either passive track index or more or less closely adhere to a benchmark with the benchmark frequently being based on exactly an index as such a stock that 's part of an index would be heavily owned by institutional investors conclusion nothing definitive being included in an equity index is usually dependent on the market cap not on intrinsic quality of the company its fundamentals or stock returns   the company is considered a good prospect growth or value in a sector that is popular with institutional investors there 's a certain amount of in investing to completely a known it saying you do n't get fired for investing in aapl   while truly outstanding and successful investors seek non popular assets which would be undervalued the bulk is likely to go with best practices and the general rules for valuation and analysis everyone uses are reasonably similar as such if one company invests in a stock it 's likely a competitor will follow similar reasoning to invest in it   conclusion nothing definitive you do n't know if the price at which those institutional companies bought the stock is way lower than now you do n't know if the stock is held for its returns potential or as part of an index or some fancy strategy you as individual investor ca n't follow the company 's technicals lead the algorithms to prefer it and they feed off of each other somewhat similar in spirit to 2 except this time it 's algorithmic trading making decisions based on technicals instead of portfolio managers based on   obviously same conclusion applies even more so the company sold a large part of the stock directly to institutional investor as part of an offering sometimes as part of ipo ala pnc and sometimes additional capital raising ala buffett and bac conclusion nothing definitive that investor holds on to the investment sometimes for reason not only directly related to stock performance e.g. control of the company or synergies also does the fact that own is high mean that the company is a good investment and/or less risky not necessarily in 2008 bear stearns own was 77

he is assuming flat structural growth    amazon is turning no profit because they are a services company not a hardware company they use all their money to invest in infrastructure to expand their services amd needs to spend a lot of money to operate a fab to produce chips while amazon keeps spending money to expand new business units offering greater services    imagine you are a toll bridge operator you build a bridge and collect a toll but instead of declaring the fees collected as profit you start construction of another bridge paid for by the profits of the first you are pretty careful not to go crazy with debt so you break even all the time    20 year later you have 10 bridges paying for the next ten to be built those 20 will pay for the next 20 their bridge membership club keeps customers using existing bridges and automatically brings in customers for newly built ones    of course it took amazon so long to catch the largest retailer and so little to double them    the next large play is really large the whole foods purchase they bought the foundational land for hundreds of small bridges to more easily connect them to even more bridge users    once amazon is done growing and they have thousands of bridges collecting tolls all over the world the money flow will be absolutely insane    but they will still be breaking even as they will be buying fleets of aircraft and other international chains for further delivery but the small profit they declare will still be pretty big it wo n’t be apple sized profit but it will be an amazing amount of revenue    amazon is to big box retail what big box retail was to mom pop retail the oxygen remover    they want to be the toll booth operator for all retail in the entire world

that 's a really good idea though in most cases like this the template letter is sufficient someone with legal expertise drafts a template letter with the that this letter will probably have the desired effect under a specific set of circumstances if this set of circumstances apply to you then you can print this letter out and send it   legally a properly worded denial by an individual is no different than the same denial written by a lawyer so unless someone has actually began litigation there 's rarely a necessity to seek legal advice and in most cases firing off a denial or a fuck off letter is more legally advantageous than silence so it might not even be worth it

i can think of one major income source you did n't mention dividends   rather than withdrawing from your pension pot you can roll it over to a sipp invest it in quality dividend growth stocks then depending on your pension size withdraw only the dividends to live on the goal here is that you buy quality dividend growth stocks    this will mean you rarely have to sell your investments and can weather the ups and downs of the market in relative comfort while using the dividends as your income to live off of    the growth aspect comes into play when considering keeping up with inflation or simply growing your income    in effect companies grow the size of their dividend payments and you use that to beat the effects of inflation meanwhile you do get the benefit of principle growth in the companies you 've invested in    i do n't know the history of the uk stock market but the us market has averaged over 7 total return including dividends over the long term a typical dividend payout is not much better than your annuity option though 3 to 4 is probably achievable    although looking at the list of uk dividend champion list companies that have grown their dividend for 25 years continuous some of them have higher yields than that right now    though that might be a warning sign btw given all the legal changes around buy to lets recently increases stamp duty on purchase reduction in mortgage interest deduction increased paperwork burden due to right to rent laws etc you want to check this carefully to make sure you 're safe on forecasting your return

i think the part of your question about not wanting to mess up more is the most important element you say you know someone with good credit who is willing to co sign for you but let 's be honest your credit is n't bad for no reason   your credit 's bad because you have a history of not paying on your obligations putting someone else 's credit at risk even though they may be willing to try and help could be doing exactly what you said you 're trying to avoid messing up more   this person 's heart is in the right place but you really have to ask yourself if you should put them in jeopardy by agreeing to guarantee your debts so the vehicle you bought is older and has a lot of miles you knew that when you bought it   so you 're paying a high interest rate because of your bad credit history you knew that when you bought it   why you think the vehicle 's only going to last another year is what confuses me   there are many vehicles out there with much higher mileage that are still on the road and with proper preventative maintenance there 's no reason your truck ca n't do the same the fact is you just do n't like what you 're paying or what you 're driving even though you were good with both when someone was willing to extend you credit so now you see this other person 's willingness to co sign for you as your ticket out of a situation you no longer want to be in my suggestion is that you stay with the loan you have take care of the vehicle to make it last and prove that you can pay your obligations   hopping from loan to loan is n't going to do your credit any favors   one of the big factors for your credit score is the average age of accounts   going and signing a new loan now will only drag that number down and hurt your score not help it   and there 's no guarantee the next car you buy with your friend 's help is going to last the length of that loan either i would be careful about this grass is greener on the other side attitude and just bear through your situation if only to prove to yourself that you can do it    there 's nothing saying your friend wo n't still be willing to co sign for you later on down the line of something does happen to the truck but you can show them that you 're trying to be responsible in the meantime by following through on what you already agreed to

not entirely for a creditor to go after the parent company in one of these cases requires the courts to be willing to pierce the corporate veil in legal parlance typically this is only done if the parent company set up the wholly owned subsidiary in order to a fraud in this case the subsidiary has a totally legitimate function to risk   while you 're right that the parent company may have to offer some form of credit guarantees to get the subsidiary to get a loan often those guarantees still do n't create nearly as much exposure for the parent company

the strength of your plan is that you have considered that if you contribute early the the 401 k you might not get the match so you do stretch it out for the entire year   one benefit to putting money into the hsa early is that it will be available if you need it early in the year if you have a major medical emergency in the first quarter if you need to pay a $ 4,000 deductible in january because of you would hate to have to use post tax money to pay the bill of course if you have had the hsa for several years then this might not be a problem if you have n't maxed the roth ira for 2013 you could make contributions to the ira up until april 15 2014 to count for the previous year   a risk with the hsa is if you leave your employer mid year you can keep the money and use it for medical expenses but if the new company does n't have a an hsa high deductible plan you might have contributed too much   the 401 k hsa and ira are annual limits so if you will switch companies you are responsible for not going over the limit

in practical terms it should n't   market cap changes every day assuming public trading of course or even second by second and focusing on investor sentiment toward your company 's stock is not the wisest way to make strategic decisions that being said company execs do need to be mindful of unusual swings in their company 's share prices because it can sometimes be an indicator of news information of which they 're unaware   at the same time you ca n't just disregard your shareholders especially the big institutional players who may have large voting blocks with which to replace you if they feel you 're not responsive to events   they are the ones who make strategic decisions based on your company 's share price right grin the issue around swings in market cap is more about public perception than reality so it is important for companies to have a good public relations strategy ready to go that can address questions concerns in case of some market event   after all consumers who hear that a company 's share price has suddenly fallen by say 30 might be more hesitant to do business with that company because there 's a perhaps irrational fear the company 's not doing well and may not be around much longer investors are by their very nature emotional rather than rational   any kind of news can cause a toward or away from a stock for no reason that an investment professional could ever explain   that 's why it 's impossible to spend any real time focusing on market cap leave that to your department to worry about if as a company executive you focus on doing the right things to make your company successful then any questions concerns about market cap will resolve themselves good luck

a very simplified bond pricing equation goes thus 1 + interest ^ to reiterate that is a very simplified model but it allows us to demonstrate the 3 key factors that drive fair value the interest relative to the current market rate if your aaa bond yields 1 but an equally good aaa bond currently sells at 3 in the market then the equivalent value is the face value minus 2 1 3 for every year to maturity   years to maturity because 1 is multiplied for every year to maturity longer dated bonds are more sensitive to changes in market rates if your bond yields 2 less than market but matures in a year then it 's worth $ 98 but if it matures in 56 years then it 's only worth ^ 56 = $ 32 conversely if your bond yields more than the market rate then its price will be greater than face value the company might default on the debt if a bond has a fair value of $ 100 but you think there 's a 50 chance that the company will default then it 's only worth $ 50 in fact it can be worth even less because getting paid on a defaulted bond can often take time and/or money and/or lawyers in your case because your bond matures in 56 years but yields ~5 well above the current market rate for it to be below face value implies a strong probability of default or a strong belief that market returns will be above 5 over the next 56 years

why is nobody providing a service that is basically give me your money i will invest it as i see fit a year later i will return the capital to you plus half of any profits or losses this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses because they can already make lots of money by just charging people an fee and not having to cover their losses   why take on the risk of having to cover your losses when they can just take a percentage of your assets and stick you with any losses in addition as charles e. grant mentioned in a comment on another answer if a person has both sufficient capital to cover your losses and sufficient confidence in their investing acumen that they do n't think they will have to do so they have little need for your money   rather than take half the gains on your money they will invest their own money they must have some or else they ca n't guarantee your losses and take all the gains your scheme would only be plausible as a partnership between a person with investing skills but little capital and another person with ample capital and less skill   in that case the investment could genuinely benefit from access to the 's capital   as quid noted in chat this does exist in the form of ad hoc private equity arrangements between individuals   however such a setup is unlikely to exist as an off the shelf product marketed at retail investors because financial institutions have more capital than any individual retail investor and more generally anyone with sufficient skill to pull this off will at least in theory quickly accumulate enough capital that they can negotiate a less risky payment plan

vesting as you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price   actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option   your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares the other have conditions attached the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future   when the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares dividends arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners i.e. the shareholders by selling goods and/or services at a profit   how does that money actually get to the shareholders   there are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one   periodically potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend   every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held so for example in 4 years or so after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company   if the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $ 20,000   depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this those are the basic concepts as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur but that 's hopefully enough to get you started

for the first part of your question i think the answer is a combination of three things   1 bigger companies have leverage to negotiate better deals due to volume   2 some of these companies are also taking bookings from outside the us for people traveling to the us either directly or through affiliates   this means that they also have income in other currencies so they may not actually be making as many wire transfers as you think   they simply keep a bank account in europe for example in euros to receive and send money in the eurozone as needed   they balance the exchange on their books internally in this case without actually sending funds through the international banking system   similarly in other parts of the world 3 these companies are not going to make a wire transfer for every transaction in any case   they are going to transfer big sums of money to an account abroad to balance things on a longer term basis weekly month etc   then they will make individual payments to service providers out of the overseas account in between these larger international transfers for the second part of your question i think there 's probably no way for a new business to get the advantages of scale unless you 've got significant capital backing your endeavor that would make it plausible that you 'll be transferring in scale   i do n't see any reason in principle that the new company could not establish bank accounts abroad and try to execute the plan outlined in 2 above except that it would require some set up costs to do the proper paperwork in each country probably to travel and to initially fund the various accounts

all transactions within an ira are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the   distributions from the ira are concerned you can only take cash from an ira and a cash distribution from a traditional ira is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the ira from sales of stock etc in short just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to las vegas what happens within the ira stays within the ira note some ira custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you so that ownership of the 100 shares of ge say that you hold within your ira is transferred to you in your personal non ira brokerage account but as far as the irs is concerned your ira custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution gave you the cash and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the ira it is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of ge stock inside the ira and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of ge stock in your personal brokerage account your basis in the 100 shares of ge stock is the cash that you received as a distribution from the ira so that when you sell the shares at some future time your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis the capital gains that occurred within the ira when the shares were sold by your ira custodian remain within the ira and you do n't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates that being said i would like to add to what told you in his answer your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011 it is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away and so she likely had started taking required minimum distributions from her ira before her death so you should have been taking rmds from the inherited ira starting with year 2012 the rmd for 2011 if not taken already by your mother before    she passed away should have been taken by her estate and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will or if she died in accordance with state law and/or probate court there would    not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the rmds taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case so have you taken the rmds for 2012 2016 or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early   the penalty for not taking a rmd is 50 of the amount not distributed yes 50 if you did n't take rmds from the inherited ira for years 2012 2016 i recommend that you consult a cpa with expertise in tax law ask the cpa if he she is an enrolled agent with the irs enrolled agents have to pass an exam administered by the irs to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke and can represent you in front of the irs in cases of audit etc

i gather from your mention of stamp duty that you 're in britain   i 'm only familiar with us cards but for them i ca n't see that there is any reason other than a lack of self discipline not to use a credit card wherever possible especially these days 1 there are plenty of cards with no annual fee 2 you get anywhere from 1 5 discount cash back on purchases 3 many will give you sign up bonuses and a year or more of zero interest   so you put that money in your investment account and odds are you make a profit on it 4 even after the introductory 0 interest period you get on average about a month of 0 interest between purchase and due date during which period the money can be earning interest for you i 've made a good many thousands of dollars over the years doing this   again the only drawback i can see is that you may not have the self discipline to pay off the accounts before they start charging interest

i think you 're doing the right thing one of the benefits of tax deferred account aside of it being tax deferred is that it keeps the money locked from you some people think it 's a bad thing i think it 's a good thing the amount of money locked is not that significant relatively to your income 10 in your case which is a lot relatively to others of your age and shows that you think ahead and plan for your future but it builds up a cushion to fall to when you 're old many people do n't think of the time they 're old or think they 'll be the same or better income wise as they 're now that is not so although during the period of your life your marginal tax will indeed grow in the end it goes back down again for most of the people and that is because your income goes down it is then that you need the money you 're putting aside now and the more you put aside and the earlier you put it aside the more you will have then the fact that it 's locked promises that you will have it then not before when you want to buy a house you ca n't afford or impress a girl with a car you ca n't pay for in my mind that 's the best benefit and the fact that the earlier you start putting the money there the more gains it will acquire until you actually need it so keep up the good work and save for your future lock out that 10 and invest the rest in other channels which may be more risky and with more potential gains

this question came up again living in florida working remotely ny employer withholds nys taxes correct or incorrect and the poster on the new version did n't find the existing answers to be adequate so i 'm adding a new answer    nys will tax this income if the arrangement is for the convenience of the employee if the arrangement is necessary to complete the work then you should have no nys tax new york state taxes all new york source salary and wage income of nonresident employees when the arrangement is for convenience rather than by necessity laws of new york 20 source similar text can also be found here the nys tax document governing this situation seems to be tsb i looked at this page from nys that was mentioned in the answer by @littleadv that language does at first glance seem to lead to a different answer but the ruling in the tax memo seems to say that if you 're out of state only for your convenience then the services were performed in nys for nys tax purpose from the memo however any allowance claimed for days worked outside new york state must be based upon the performance of services which of necessity as distinguished from convenience the employee to out state duties in the service of his employer

be radical i assume you are not working for a city bank getting paid city wages e.g. you are one of the 99 of people in london or more normal income house prices and rents in london and anywhere within reasonable commuting distances are now so high that couples in reasonable jobs often have to rent rooms in shared houses    this is due to so many people wishing to live work in london and there not being enough new homes built   if you are looking at buying a property to rent out you need the rent to be about double the interest payments on the mortgage otherwise you will not be able to afford repairs or cope when interest rates increase you could also get a tax bill that is more the your profit    finding such a property is very hard in london as the prices of homes have gone up a lot more in london then rents have      there are still some flats where the rent will cover the landlord ’s costs but not many    any landlord that brought more than a few years ago is making a very nice profit in london as the rents have gone up a lot since they brought but are you willing to bet your life on the rents going up even more moving a short distance out of london does not help much so look at somewhere like manchester or birmingham

i would just take $ 2000 and multiply by your marginal tax rate weight that between the 5 other people according to their share of the prize money and ask them to give you that from your question it seems like you all have a good working relationship i 'm sure the other partners would agree to that i think it 's the simplest solution that is also fair and equitable basically you pay the tax on 2000 and they pay you back for their share of the tax much easier than trying to pass it through your tax return for 5 separate people for a minimal amount of $ 's in hindsight the best way to do it would have been to 1099 the person with the lowest marginal tax rate for the year to minimize the total tax paid on the 2000 probably only would've been a few dollars difference but still the most efficient way to do it

its important that you carefully read the agreement if you accept the job the options agreement will usually specify the vesting schedule the strike price and the number of options you will have   when you start vesting options you can choose to buy stock at the strike price when you do exercise the options your employer will likely withhold state and federal income tax the strike price will hopefully be well below the market price   unlike stock when your employment ends you usually are not able to hold on to your options there 's typically a small window of time in which you can exercise your options you should read this part of the agreement carefully and plan accordingly

the roofing situation is clear   visas distort the roofing labor market by reducing prevailing wages with lower paid immigrant labor   this allows companies to offer products at reduced prices   it would be unrealistic to try and run a business with local us born labor that 's higher priced   if your competitors can hire low priced foreigners you need to do it too unless you can somehow find locals at the same price quality productivity   if the labor supply was cut off then it 's likely that no roofing companies could find labor for $   they 'd have to raise wages take fewer jobs or go out of business   this would raise prices     customers would n't be happy but they 'd pay the price because they need roof work done   all vendors prices would go up equally   this process may take time   there 's a shortage   prices go up   wages go up   jobs become more desirable   more workers get trained in the field increasing the supply of labor   this occurs until the labor supply is back in balance   on a side note this particular business owner sounds like they need better marketing   if prospects want low priced work they 're going to get low quality results   if she wants to sell a premium roofing product she needs to differentiate it from everyone else   no customer spends more money just to support someone else 's employees   if she can only get penny pinching customers she needs to do penny pinching work

hey no worries at all like any business practice there are proper uses and abuses first and foremost companies should engage in allocation of capital that best serves their uses given prospects of returns in a broad sense this could very well include employee remuneration after that all excess funds should be distributed through buybacks or dividends    there is without a doubt going on i.e. buybacks preceding prudent capex or other investments to boost c suite pay in other cases it is actually used to hide declining performance altogether declining earnings compensated by decreasing outstanding shares this is simply poor management using these tools they would have most likely used others were these not made available to them e.g underpaying    it 's an investors job to allocate capital that rewards good management practice the problem is that this is an ideal made harder by obfuscation on the part of management lack of governance and even the rise of passive management among others    i 'm in private equity myself with a strong focus on prudence and longevity of companies so these are considerations that go without saying i 'm sometimes quite what public companies get away with but you ca n't blame tools for being used poorly or being available

typically preferred shares come with one or both different benefits a disproportionate share of votes say 10 votes per share vs the normal 1 or a preferred dividend   the vote preference is great for the owner(s looking to go public but not lose control of the company say i am a walton of walmart fame and when i went public i sold 80 of the 1000 share total company but in creating the share structure 20 of shares were assigned 10 votes each 800 shares now trade with 800 votes 200 shares have 10 votes each or 2000 votes so there are still the 1000 shares but 2800 votes the 20 of shares now have or 71 of the total votes so my shares are just less than half ownership but over 78 of votes   preferred dividend is as simple as that buy stock a for ownership or same company stock a preferred shares which have ownership and $ dividend   edited to show a bit more math i use a simple example to call out a total 1000 shares the percentages would be the same for a million or billion shares if 20 were a 10 vote preferred

in a rational market the market caps total value of all shares of the company should be determined by the expected future profits of the company plus the book value that is the value of all assets that the company holds the share price is then calculated as market caps divided by number of shares a company worth a billion dollar could have a million shares at $ 1000 each or a billion shares at $ 1 each or anything in between   when profits drop every investor has to re think what the expected future profits of the company are if all the investors say i thought this company would make a billion profit in the next ten years but based on the drop in profits i changed my mind and i think they will only make 500 million then the share price drops on the other hand if profits dropped because of some predictable event then that drop was already priced into the share price if the profits dropped less than expected the share price might even go up   you can see the opposite effect share price might be very high because everyone expects huge growth in profits over the next ten years if profits grow less than expected the share price will drop share price depends on predicted future profits not on profits today

inflation as defined in the general has many impacts at a personal level for example you say that the reduction in the price of oil has no impact on you   that 's absolutely not true unless you 're a living off of the land   every box or can or jar of food you buy off the shelf of the grocery store has the price of oil baked into it because it had to get there somehow   high fuel costs for trucks mean increased costs to put food on shelves which mean increased prices for that food even tobacco prices can affect you because they affect what other people are spending   demand is always a significant factor in prices particularly retail prices and if people are spending more money on tobacco they 're probably spending less on other things either buying less snacks for example or buying cheaper brands of those snacks   so the price of may drop a bit or not rise for example general inflation also tends to drive raises particularly in industries with relatively small performance ties to raises   if inflation is 3 wages need to raise 3 or so in order to keep up on average even if your personal cost of living went up 0 or 5 or 10 the default wage inflation will be closer to that of the national average   any raise less than national average is effectively a pay cut which is one reason why inflation is needed in a healthy economy   so your company probably has a cost of living raise everyone gets that 's a bit less than inflation and then good performers get a bump up to a bit more than inflation   you can read more on this topic for a more in depth explanation finally inflation rates tend to be major factors in stock market movement   inflation that is too high or too low can lead to higher volatility inflation that is right can lead to higher stability   an economy that has consistently right inflation around 2 3 typically will tend to have more stable stock market in general and thus more reliable returns from that market   there are many other factors that lead to stock markets rising and falling but inflation is one very relevant one particularly if it 's not in the right zone

this is only partly true   the main problem is that the average person is not a fully informed healthcare consumer    for example if you go to your local doctor with lower back pain one doctor might prescribe a whole bunch of expensive tests another might tell you to go to a and yet another might tell you to take some cheap pain killers and come back in six weeks time if nothing has changed most people will have no way of knowing which is the best course of action then in a country like the us which is very all the doctors will recommend the most comprehensive and expensive care package so that they do n't get sued    ultimately economists do not work in healthcare and are not qualified to recommend the best financial model for healthcare delivery   to quote who knew that healthcare was so complicated certainly not the economists

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

you can not determine this solely by the ticker length however there are some conventions that may help steer you there nasdaq has 2 4 base letters bats has 4 base letters nyse equity securities have 1 4 base letters nyse mkt formerly amex have 1 4 base letters nyse arca has 4 base letters otc has 4 base letters security types other than equities may have additional letters added and each exchange and data vendors have different conventions for how this is handled so if you see t for a us listed security it would be only be either nasdaq nyse or nyse mkt if you see then you can not tell which exchange it is listed on   in this case networks is actually a nyse stock for some non equity security types such as hybrids and debt instruments some exchanges add p to the end for nasdaq and otc and nyse nyse mkt have a variety of methods including not adding anything to the ticker   examples include nyse nasdaq   it all becomes rather confusing given the changes in conventions over the years essentially you require data that provides you with ticker listing location and security type the exchanges allocate security tickers in conjunction with the sec so there are no overlaps   eg the same ticker can not represent two different securities however tickers can be re used   for example the ticker ab has been used by the following companies

no you probably do not need to file a tax return if you received no income and if you meet a number of other criteria the below is copied and pasted slightly edited from the cra you must file a return for 2014 if any of the following situations    apply you have to pay tax for 2014 we sent you a request to file a return you and your spouse or common law partner elected to split pension    income for 2014 see lines 115 116 129 and 210 you received working income tax benefit advance payments in    2014 you disposed of capital property in 2014 for example if you sold    real estate or shares or you realized a taxable capital gain for    example if a mutual fund or trust attributed amounts to you or you    are reporting a capital gains reserve you claimed on your 2013    return you have to repay any of your old age security or employment insurance    benefits see line 235 you have not repaid all amounts withdrawn from your registered    retirement savings plan rrsp under the home plan or the    lifelong learning plan for more information go to home buyers plan    hbp or see guide lifelong learning plan llp or you have to    contribute to the canada pension plan cpp this can apply if for    2014 the total of your net self employment income and    employment income is more than $ 3,500 see line you are paying employment insurance premiums on self employment and    other eligible earnings see lines and 430 in general you will want to file a tax return even if none of the above applies you could for example claim a gst hst credit even with no income now if you receive any income at all you are going to have to pay taxes which means you are obligated to file a tax return if sufficient taxes were deducted from your paycheque you are still obligated to file a tax return however you will not have to pay penalties if you file late even if you file very late at least not until the cra sends you a request to file but be aware you wo n't likely be able to tell if you owe the cra money until you do your taxes and if you do end up owing there are substantial penalties for filing late in general i 'd strongly advise filing your tax return in almost all circumstances

easy answer pay down your debt   why easy because you ca n't afford the house the other posters mentioned it i 'll tackle it too your $ mortgage payment estimation is just that mortgage only why have n't you   included home insurance or taxes according to that last graphic those are $ 1930 and $ 1910 per year that adds $ 320 to your monthly cost $ + $ 320 = $ more than what you 're paying in rent and you say you have little enough left over after that   and that 's not counting cmhc insurance like chris w. rea mentioned or maintenance which is something renters always underestimate i know i did   and do n't even get me started on the fact that the currently super low interest rate is fixed for only 5 years   i know you really really want to buy a house and you really want to stay in that expensive area you live in and you 're trying hard to make the numbers work but the fact is you 're setting yourself up for bankruptcy   realistically you have these options 1 stay in the area forget buying for the foreseeable future continue renting pay down debt and then save for a proper down payment 2 stay in the area but make a smaller cheaper place work 3 move to a cheaper location 4 figure out how to make more money   that 's it sorry to be blunt this is the reality

it 's a dilution of the ownership the public used to own x% of facebook and now they own less than x% of the bigger facebook that incorporates whatsapp assuming that whatsapp was completely private before logically the $ 15 billion is allocated proportionately between the existing stockholders x% of it for the general public y% for mark zuckerberg etc   however it does n't really make sense to think of it that way unless whatsapp is actually worthless what 's important are the proportions suppose that the newly issued shares correspond to 25 of the previous share capital then previously the general public owned x% out of 100 and now they own x% out of 125 i.e. of the new share capital whether the actual value of those stocks has changed depends entirely on the actual value that whatsapp adds to the old facebook as dheer says only time will tell on that one apart from the financial consequences dilution is sometimes considered important because it can mean a change in influence a significant shareholder would often be able to encourage the company to act in a certain way with a lower percentage ownership that influence is diminished

a few years back me and a couple of friends made about 100 of these on his 30 watt laser cutter at the time i was using them for ring boxes because i make spoon rings and wanted something to give to people for the nicer sterling rings if i remember correctly we used high plywood at 1/8 thickness the grade we were buying ran us about $ 30 for a sheet we cut them into sheets because that 's the max size for his laser and cut roughly 5 out of each sheet the ones we were making were of course much smaller than what you are looking at though materials alone ended up running about $ .50 a piece we were coating with one layer of oil it was roughly ten minutes to cut out 5 boxes then another ten minutes to pop them out of the plywood and assemble each one despite what has been stated with tweaking friction fit held up completely fine we did n't use glue on a single one and i still have a few laying around that are holding up fine also anyway say you are paying yourself roughly $ 20 an hour and you can speed it up from what we did and make 20 in an hour now you have $ 1 a piece in labor keep in mind if you go to a place to have these made from my experience most places will charge you roughly $ 1 a minute for laser time add engraving time if you want a logo or something on them probably another minute per box all in all in the end these are going to end up costing you $ a box if you have free access to a laser i would imagine anyone making them for you would probably charge double that    in the end after the first batch of both these boxes some slightly different and some jewelry trees we found out that it 's hard to sell these items for an affordable price and still make it worth your while if i remember correctly we ended up selling most of the remaining boxes for about $ 4 a piece just to break even and cover all of our expenses of course this is just my experience if someone has a way to do this more efficiently and for a profit i would be interested to hear it because we still have the laser and probably 100 sheets of plywood left

when you hold units of the tsx etf you are indirectly holding u.s. dollars cash or cash equivalents the etf can be thought of as a container the container gives you the convenience of holding usd in say cad denominated accounts that do n't normally provide for usd cash balances the etf price $ and $ in your example simply reflects the cad price of those usd and the change is because the currencies moved with respect to each other and so necessarily given how the etf is made up when the value of the u.s. dollar declines vs. the canadian dollar it follows that the value of your units of declines as quoted in canadian dollar terms currencies move all the time similarly if you held the same amount of value in u.s. dollars directly instead of using the etf you would still experience a loss when quoted in canadian dollar terms in other words whether or not your u.s. dollars are tied up either in or else sitting in a u.s. dollar cash balance in your brokerage account there 's not much of a difference you lose canadian dollar equivalent when the value of usd declines with respect to cad selling more quickly your units in a usd denominated account to yield u.s. dollars that you then directly hold does not insulate you from the same currency risk what it does is reduce your exposure to other cost risk factors inherent with etfs liquidity spreads and fees however i doubt that any of those played a significant part in the change of value from $ to $ that you described

the stock tends to drop by the amount of the dividend or if you prefer to think of it this way the stock price has been pushed up by the amount of the dividend before it was paid out really all this shift does is factor out the impending dividend 's effect on the real purchase cost of the stock as such it 's pretty much irrelevant except that of course the dividend is short term gain that you have to pay taxes on almost immediately which also tends to get figured into the price folks are willing to pay for the stock conclusion no there 's no real opportunity here there 's a slight tax reason to avoid buying right before dividends are paid but that 's about it basic principle if it 's simple and obvious the market has already accounted for it

like all other loan vs savings questions it depends on the terms of the loan if you have a choice the usual answer is to pay off the loan with the worst terms which usually means the highest interest rate first and only start with savings when you 've paid off all the high interest loans entirely if your student loan is on us terms then pay it off as soon as you can unless you have commercial debt credit card or unsecured personal loan which you should pay off first or unless you have or are realistically likely to get eligibility for a forgiveness program but it does depends on the terms of the debt which in turn depend on the country you studied in on uk terms it 's a very bad idea to pay off a student loan any faster than you have to   interest is restricted to the rate of inflation so good investments probably beat the interest rate of the student loan the required repayments vary with your income so savings are more useful than debt repayment if you encounter income difficulties e.g unemployment in the future and finally the debt is automatically forgiven after 30 years so you may never have to pay it all back anyway so why pay it off voluntarily if it would get forgiven eventually anyway

and the weird shit is that it 's actually kind of good thing for the banks to do that   if there is lot 's of money around on people it means they can invest it on something that investment helps new businesses to emerge and employ more people   if there would be less money around the rich dudes would still invest but there could not be so much competition in investing so they could ask for higher interests    this would mean that the system is rewarding someone more not because he is taking bigger risks or because he is driving the economy into efficient direction but because there just happens to be shortage of money   does more money imply that more people will invest yes because of inflation they have to invest not to lose actually that 's why governments maintain inflation so that people are forced to invest

payment of taxes for your personal return filed with the irs always come from your personal account regardless of how the money was earned sales tax would be paid from your business account so would corporate taxes if those apply but if you 're talking about your tax payments to the irs for your personal income that should be paid from your personal account also stating the obvious if you 're paying an accountant to handle things you can always ask them for clarification as well they will have more precise answers edit adding on for your last part of the question i missed   in virtually all cases llc 's are what 's called a pass through entity   for these entities all income in the eyes of the federal government passes directly through the entity to the owners at the end of each year   they are then taxed personally on this net income at their individual tax rate that 's the very abridged version at least the llc pays no taxes directly to the federal government related to your income here 's a resource if you 'd like to learn more about llc 's

in finance form is function and while a reason for a trade could be anything but since the result of a trade is a change in value it could be presumed that one seeks to receive a change in value stock company there may have been more esoteric examples but currently possession of a company total ownership of its assets actually is by percentage or a glorified frequently called a share   percentage companies are usually sole proprietorship and partnerships but partnerships can now trade in units   share companies are usually corporations with shares a company can be divided into almost totally indistinguishable units   this allows for more flexible ownership so individuals can trade them without having to change the company contract considering the ease of trade it could be assumed that common stock contract provisions were formulated to provide for such an ease motivation to trade this could be anything but it seems those with the largest ownership of common stock have lots of wealth so it could be assumed that people at least want to own stocks to own wealth shorting might be a little harder to reason but i personally assume that the motivation to trade is still to increase wealth social benefit of the stock market assuming that ownership in a company is socially valuable and that the total value of ownership is proportional to the social value provided the social benefit of a stock market is that it provided the means to scale ownership through convenience speed and reliability

he did n't sell in the normal way that most people think of when they hear the term sell he engaged in a perfectly legitimate technique known as short selling in which he borrows shares from his broker and sells them immediately he 's betting that the price of the stock will drop so he can buy them back at a lower price to return the borrowed shares back to his broker he gets to pocket the difference he had about $ 37,000 of cash in his account since he borrowed shares and sold them immediately at $ 2/share he got $ 16,800 in cash and owed his broker 8400 shares so his net purchasing power at the time of the short sale was $ 37,000 + $ 16,800 4800 shares $ 2/share as the price of the stock changes his purchasing power will change according to this equation he 's allowed to continue to borrow these 8400 shares as long as his purchasing power remains above 0 that is the broker requires him to have enough cash on hand to buy back all of his borrowed shares at any given moment if his purchasing power ever goes negative he 'll be subject to a margin call the broker will make him either deposit cash into his account or close his positions sell long positions or buy back short positions until it 's positive again the stock jumped up to $ the next morning before the market opened during before hours trading his purchasing power at that time was $ 37,000 + $ 16,800 8400 shares $ = since his purchasing power was negative he was subject to a margin call by the time he got out he had to pay $ to buy back the 8400 shares that he borrowed making his purchasing power this $ was money that he borrowed from his broker to buy back the shares to fulfill his margin call his huge loss was from borrowing shares from his broker note that his maximum potential loss is unlimited since there is no limit to how much a stock can grow evidently he failed to grasp the most important concept of short selling which is that he 's borrowing stock from his broker and he 's obligated to give that stock back whenever his broker wants no matter what it costs him to fulfill that obligation

some proportion of the costs of a policy have little to no relationship to miles driven   think of costs of underwriting and more especially sales marketing client acquisition costs auto insurance is n't in the same league as non term life insurance where the commissions and other selling expenses typically exceed the first year 's worth of premiums but the funny tv ads and/or agent commissions are n't free as well as general business overhead also as noted by quid some proportion of claim risk is n't correlated to distance covered think theft flood fire etc there are also differences in the miles that are likely to be driven by a non commercial vehicle for hire driver who puts 25k miles a year vs. one who puts 7k per year   the former is generally going to be doing more driving at higher speeds on less freeways while the latter will be doing more of their driving on crowded urban roads   the former pattern generally has a lower expected value of claims both due to having fewer cars per road mile fewer and driveways and also having any given collision be more likely to result in a fatality paralysis or other lifetime disability claims are generally going to exceed what the insurer would pay out on a fatality

good question if a person has a choice it is probably better to pay cash but not always if your large pile of cash can earn more being invested than cost of the interest to borrow a similar large pile of cash it is beneficial to get a mortgage otherwise pay cash example a house costs $ 100,000 i have $ 100,000 in extra money i can invest that at 5 per year and i can borrow an additional $ 100,000 at 2 per year since i can make more on my pile of cash than it costs to borrow another pile of cash borrowing is better compound interest is the most powerful force on the planet according to albert einstein maybe that is n't likely for most people though here is the results from some online financial calculators borrowing $ 100,000 with 2 interest for 30 years will cost a total of $ you get $ 100,000 but it cost you $ to do it saving $ 100,000 in a bank account with an interest rate of 5 will be worth $ in 30 years by not spending the money you will earn $ over the course of 30 years so if you can invest at 5 and borrow at 2 you will end up with $ more than if you did n't it is a pretty extreme example and financial advisers make a lot of money figuring out the complex nature of money to make situations like that possible

while most all canadian brokers allow us access to all the us stocks the reverse is not true   but some us brokers do allow trading on foreign exchanges e.g. interactive brokers at which i have an account   you have to look and be prepared to switch brokers   americans can not use canadian brokers and vice versa trading of shares happens where ever two people get together hence the pink sheets   these work well for americans who want to buy sell foreign stocks using usd without the hassle of fx conversions   you get the same economic exposure as if the actual stock were bought    but the exchanges are barely and liquidity can dry up and fx moves are not necessarily arbitraged away by the market   you do n't have the same safety as adrs because there is no bank holding any stash of actual stocks to backstop those traded on the pink sheets

so betas are not found on a company 's financial statements beta is essentially a measure of the covariance of an asset and the overall market return in relation to the variance of the market 's return   a beta of 1 is to describe an asset whose daily returns mimic the returns of the overall market a beta of gt;1 describes an asset whose returns are greater than the market return and a beta describes an asset whose returns are less than the market return   to the extent that the asset you are comparing to the market index is a share of common stock the beta you are looking at is levered if the company has debt or preferred stock   the technique your professor is alluding to is the process of betas of two different companies that may have similar underlying operating assets but because of different capital structures have different betas when using their common stock returns this adjustment makes comparing different betas between companies agnostic of the capital structure used

the notion that you can put product on the web and sit back and watch the money roll in is a myth plain and simple   if you put content on the web and expect people to pay money for your products t shirts etc you have to do the work to get your stuff seen by people and preferably the right kind of people who will buy your stuff that means you need to know your market and provide something that they are eager to pay for this does n't necessarily mean buying advertising to direct traffic to your site there are plenty of no cost ways to bring people to your web site but instead of costing $ $ the cost is in effort and time that you have to put into it also keep in mind that the more participants you have in your production and fulfillment pipeline the less you will make off every sale hands off production services like or cafe press do everything for you all you have to do is provide the artwork   however they also take all the income and pay you a rather percentage of sales   you can get a larger percentage of sales if you do more of the work yourself like handmade items sold on etsy   but then you 're doing work maybe you 'll get $ 1 for each t shirt you sell   if you just upload your artwork to the production service and type in some product description text into their web sales catalog how many sales will you make in the first month   most likely somewhere between zero and two   why should anyone buy your shirt over the tens of thousands of other designs carried by the same production service   it 's your responsibility to tell people about your stuff and send them to the site to buy it   and that means it 's not a passive income for truly passive income invest in bank cd 's treasury bonds or in stocks that pay dividends   the only problem with that is you have to have money to make money this way

your biggest risk with a vendor like this is not that your credit card number will be stolen in transit it is that it will be stolen from the vendor i agree with that using a one time number is the best plan provided you have a bank that offers such numbers   bank of america calls it shop safe while citibank calls it virtual account numbers   i think discover card has something similar but less useful in that they are n't really one time use and i think american express discontinued their service   afaik no one else offers anything like it   if you ca n't get a one time number then i was going to suggest buying a visa gift card until i put together the fact that you are making a purchase in asia and the gift cards are not authorized for international payments due to patriot act restrictions   visa does offer the service which might help but i doubt your vendor participates or would even be allowed to participate if they do n't offer a secure order form   you can open a pre paid visa card account which is probably what i 'd do you can buy pre paid visa cards the same way you buy visa gift cards the difference being you have to register the pre paid cards thanks patriot act before you can use them   but it 's not that big a deal to register one you just fill out the online form your your ssn etc and you 're good to go load it up with enough money to cover your purchase and the fx fees and then cut it up

sounds like an illiquid option if there are actually some bidders market makers then sell the option at market price market sell order if there are not market makers then place a really low limit sell order so that you can sit at the ask in the order book a lot of time there is off book liquidity so there may be a party looking for buy liquidity you can also exercise the option to book the loss immediately selling the shares when they get delivered to you if this is an american style option but if the option is worthless then it is probably significantly underwater and you 'd end up losing a lot more as you 'd buy the stock at the strike price but only be able to sell at its current market value the loss could also be increased further if there are even more liquidity issues in the stock

i 'm curious so i 'm going to calculate it for my area i 'm in an average priced metro and a 2 bedroom apartment out here is going to cost you at least $ 1400 700 each with a and that 's if you go minutes from downtown it does n't really drop off any more than that the further you go out you 'll also still need renters insurance and to cover half the utilities lets tack on another $ 75 here conservatively at that far out you need a car and the insurance gas and maintenance costs that go with it assuming you go with something cheap say $ 5k with a payment around $ 120 a month + $ 60 a month for insurance another $ 60 for gas and accruing $ 30 a month for maintenance you 're going to need a cell phone and if you 're on a plan alone it 's not cheap with the big 4 providers so you 'll go with someone smaller for $ 50 a month even though the service is mediocre you 'll need to eat so being cheap and buying store brands and sale items you get your groceries down to $ 120 a month so that should cover the bottom level of 's pyramid which is far from glamorous that puts your living costs at $ a month being that it is a major metro minimum wage within the city is $ assuming you have a job that 's 40 hours a week that puts you at $ a month before taxes are withheld since you make so little taxes would only be around $ a month that leaves $ 49 for saving spending emergencies i live in a state that has very good support for the aca as well so the $ 300 credit roughly covers the cost of the monthly premium the deductible is obviously still impossible to pay but you do n't get hit with the penalty at year end and the hospital still gets mostly paid and you might just be able to avoid bankruptcy if the hospital is willing to negotiate the payment plan with you   so what are the conclusions here it 's possible to skate by for a short while assuming you can live without any social life stay healthy and have no emergencies   you also need the self discipline of a monk and to live in an area that supports a minimum wage relative to living costs and the aca

especially considering it has a mortgage on it technically a home    equity loan on my primary residence i 'm not following does it have a mortgage on it or your primary residence a different property was used as a security for the loan if it is heloc from a different property then it is really your business what to do with it you can spend it all on casinos in vegas for all that the bank cares is this a complicated transaction any gotchas i should be aware of    before on it obviously you should talk to an attorney and a tax adviser but here 's my two cents do n't fall for the incorporate in nevada delaware wyoming some other lie trap you must register in the state where you live and in the state where the property is incorporating in any other state will just add complexity and costs and will not save you anything whatsoever 2.1 state taxes some states tax llcs for example in california you 'll pay at least $ 800 a year just for the right of doing business if you live in california or the property is in california you will pay this if you decide to set up an llc 2.2 income taxes make sure to not elect to tax your llc as a corporation the default for llc is disregarded status and it will be taxed for income tax purposes as your person i.e. irs does n't care and does n't know about it and most states as well if you actively select to tax it as a corporation there 's such an option it will cost you very dearly so do n't and if someone suggest such a thing to you run away from that person as fast as you can mortgages it is very hard to get a mortgage when the property is under the llc if you already have a mortgage on that property the property is the one securing the loan it may get called once you transfer it into llc since from bank 's perspective that would be transferring ownership local taxes transferring into llc may trigger a new tax assessment if you just bought the property that will probably not matter much if it appreciated you may get hit with higher property taxes there are also many little things once you 're a llc and not individual you 'll have to open a business bank account will probably need a new insurance policy etc etc these do n't add much to costs and are more of an occasional nuisance

the reason for this is arbitrage in an free and open market investments that are certain to generate above average profits would do so by being sold cheaply while having a high return on investment after that but in a free market prices are set by supply and demand there is a high demand and little supply for investments that would certainly outperform the market the demand is in fact so high that the purchase price rises to the point of eliminating that excess return and with high frequency automated trading that price hike is instant but who would even want to sell such guaranteed in the first place of course there are uncertainties associated with stocks and individual stocks therefore move independently as the market is an average some stocks will therefore beat the market over certain time periods that 's random statistical variation the only realistic path to above average returns is to accept higher risks as discussed above nobody wants to sell you safe bets but risky bets are another matter different actors will price risk differently if you are n't worried much about risk you can pick up stocks that are cheap by your standards that is possible only because such stocks are n't cheap by risk averse standards   looking a bit deeper we see that arbitrage works in a free market because there 's essentially perfect information but risk is precisely the absence of such information and that can lead to price variations yet as the lack of information means a lack of certainty you ca n't use this to reliably beat the market

first of all never is too late to develop good habits so you know what you want to do and you are going about the how now first you should pay off any consumer debt except from mortgage which should be planned for prioritize your consumer debt credit cards consumer loans etc according to the interest rates starting with the one with the highest interest and going to the one with the lowest one because you should make quite the investments to pay off this interest debt and still make a profit second you should start saving some money the 10 rule of thumb is a good one and for starters having aside the money you need to get by for at least 3 months is quite okay as they say cash is king now that you actually realize the amount you can spare each month to start investing assuming you had to do something of the aforementioned it 's time to see the risk you are comfortable taking different risk taking views lead to different investing routes so assuming once again that you are risk averse having a newborn baby and all and that you want something more than just a savings account you can start looking for things that do n't require much attention even more so if you are going on you own about it such as low risk mutual funds etf exchange traded funds and index funds to track indexes like ftse and s&p500 you could get an average annual return of 10 12 just google top safe etfs for example and you could take a quick look at credible sites like forbes etc also you can take a look at fixed income options such as government bonds last but not least you can always get your pick at some value companies stocks usually big companies that have proven track record check warren buffet on this you should look for stocks that pay dividends since you are in for the long run and not just to make a quick buck   i hope i helped a bit and as always be cautious about investing since they have some inherent risks if you do n't feel comfortable with making your own investment choices you should contact a specialist like a financial planner or advisor no matter what the case may be on this you should still educate yourself on this just to get a grasp on this

to start with i should mention that many tax preparation companies will give you any number of free consultations on tax issues they will only charge you if you use their services to file a tax form such as an amended return i know that h&r block has international tax specialists who are familiar with the issues facing f-1 students so they might be the right people to talk about your specific situation according to turbotax support you should prepare a completely new 1040nr then submit that with a ’s tax department says you can submit late so you should probably do that if you need to claim non resident status for tax purposes

the way it is handled with etf 's is that someone has to gather a block of units and redeem them with the fund so with the mutual fund you redeem your unit directly with the fund always you never sell to another player with the etf its the opposite you sell to another player once a player has a large chunk of units he can go to the fund and redeem them these are very specific players investment banks not individual investors

well to get money you need to leverage your assets   so your options basically are   asset cash   well i figure if you had you would n't have asked how to get more of it but its always worth mentioning   do n't forget about cash that can be in tricky places to tap like 401ks iras investment accounts etc   there is usually some way to get at the cash but it may not be worth it and you could end up sacrificing long term financial stability if you do   asset job skills and initiative   get a job and and earn the cash    $ 2k is not a ton and if you live frugally you should be able to save it   there are tons of websites dedicated to living frugally and earning extra cash on the side    my personal favorite is r    asset good credit borrow the money from a traditional bank   signature loans go up to $ 35k at most banks just ask what it would take to qualify   you could also get a credit card for that amount and use it to start up the business     asset bad credit   if you 've got bad credit you can still take out a loan from a place like prosper or lending club or sofi these places are handy if you have good credit too   your rates will be much higher but they will still lend to you   asset property   if you own stuff you can sell it and get cash   clean out your attic or ask relatives if you can have the stuff in theirs and sell it   if you own fancy stuff you can borrow against it home car boat etc   asset your charm and winning smile   if you have a good solid business plan written down and professional looking ask around and see if you can find an investor   it could be friends or family but it could also be someone who is looking to invest   be professional and be sure to draw up the appropriate business docs if you do a partnership or take a private loan   asset your government   if you live in the us there are federal programs that offer small business loans   check out for more info   you will need a business plan and will have to meet the criteria of the loan or grant   not sure if your ecommerce business will meet the criteria as the intent of these types of programs are to spur the economy by allowing small business owners to hire workers   but its worth checking out

no the best you can do is probably determine the bank from the sort code using an online checker such as this one from the uk payments industry trade association revealing the name of an account holder is something the bank would typically require a warrant for i 'd expect or whatever is covered in the account t&cs under we provide all required assistance to the authorities switching to what i suspect is your underlying problem if this is a dispute that 's at the end of your tenancy relating to the return of the deposit then there are plenty of people to help you for free use those rather than attempting your own detective work start with the uk government how to rent guide which includes links on to shelter 's pages about deposits the cab has lots of good info here too note that if your landlord did n't put your deposit in a deposit protection scheme then as a professional landlord they could be penalised four times i think the deposit amount by a court so stick to your guns on this

i doubt that this exists but it could theoretically after all a share is kind of an option to a company 's future success and so a call is already a second level on the better approach would be to create your own put puts by investing less money a in the put you wanted to invest into and put the smaller rest b in the share itself or a call that way if the original put is successful at max b is lost and if it is unsuccessful the loss on a is covered by a gain on b potentially if you do the math you can reach a mathematical equivalent situation to a put put by buying the right amount and kind of calls however we know already that buying a put and a call is a poor strategy so that would mean a put put would also be a poor strategy

i 'm not sure if this answer is going to win me many friends on reddit but here goes   there 's no good reason why they could n't have just told him the current balance shown on their records but   there are some good reasons why they ca n't quote a definitive payoff balance to instantly settle the account   it 's very possible to charge something today and not have it show up on chase 's records until tomorrow or monday or later there are still places that process paper credit card transactions or that deal with 3rd party payment processors who reconcile transactions m f 9 and so on    most transactions these days are authorized the instant you swipe the card and the merchant wo n't process until they get authorization back from the cc company but sometimes those authorizations come from third party processors who do n't bill chase until later some of them might not process a friday afternoon transaction until close of business monday    also there are things like fares that might be collected when you exit the cab but the record exists only in the taxi 's onboard machine until they plug it into something else at the end of the shift    there are still some situations outdoor flea markets auctions etc where the merchant takes a paper imprint and does n't actually process the payment until they physically mail it in or whatever    some small businesses have information security routines in place where only one person is allowed to process credit card payments but where multiple customer service reps are allowed to accept the cc info write it down on one piece of paper then either physically hand the paper to the person with processing rights or deposit the paper in a locked office or mail slot for later processing this is obviously not an instant update system for chase believe it or not this system is actually considered to be more secure than retaining computerized records unless the business has very rigorous end to end info security    so there are a bunch of legit reasons why a cc company ca n't necessarily tell you this instant that you only need to pay $ x and no more to close the account although there is no good reason why they should n't be able to quote your current balance    what happens when you close an account is basically that they stop accepting new charges that were made after your notification but they will still accept and bill you for legit charges that you incurred before you gave them notice so basically they turn off the credit card but they ca n't guarantee how much you owe until the next billing cycle after this one closes   you notify them to close the account they stop authorizing new charges    their merchant agreements basically give the merchant a certain window to process charges the cc company process legit charges that were made prior to closing the account    the cc company sends you the final statement after that window for any charges has expired   when that final statement is paid or if it is zero that is when the account is settled and reported to equifax etc as paid    so it 's hard to tell from your post who was being overly semantic unreasonable if the cc company refused to tell the current balance they were just being but if they refused to promise that the current balance shown is enough to instantly settle the account forever they had legit reasons   hope that helps

very few people 's credit is worth $ 100,000 the average homeowner 's credit family of four with good to very good credit is worth about $ 30,000 this is a pure business decision the bank knew the law when they extended the mortgage to you and part of the amount they 're charging you goes to cover the risk that you might opt to walk away the mortgage was an agreement between you and the bank and it specified the penalty for you walking away taking the agreed upon penalty for an action specifically in the agreement is also keeping the agreement

this is an excellent topic as it impacts so many in so many different ways here are some thoughts on how the accounts are used which is almost as important as the as calculating the income or tax the roth is the best bang for the buck once you have taken full advantage of employer matched 401k.   yes you pay taxes upfront   all income earned is n't taxed under current tax rules   this money can be passed on to family and can continue forever   contributions can be funded past age 70.5   once account is active for over 5 years contributions can be withdrawn and used ie house down payment college medical bills without any penalties   all income earned must be left in the account to avoid penalties   for younger workers without an employer match this is idea given the income tax savings over the longer term and they are most likely in the lowest tax bracket the 401k is great for retirement which is made better if employer matches contributions   this is like getting paid for retirement saving   these funds are locked up until age 59.5 with exceptions   all contributed funds and all earnings are untaxed until withdrawn the idea here is that at the time contributions are added you are at a higher tax rate then when you expect to withdrawn funds trade accounts investments as stated before are the used of taxed dollars   the biggest advantage of these are the liquidity

note the answer below is speculative and not based on any first hand knowledge of pump and dump schemes the explanation with spamming does n't really makes sense for me often you see a stock jump 30 or more in a single day at a particular moment in time unlikely that random people read their emails at that time and decide to buy what i think happens is the does a somewhat risky thing starts buying a lot of shares of a stock that has declined a lot and had low volumes during the previous days as the price starts to increase other people start to notice the jump and join the buying spree also do n't forget that some probably use buy stop orders which are triggered when the price reaches a particular level also there should be some automatic trading involved maybe hft firms do pump and dumps as you have to trade a big volume in a relatively short time span i think it is unlikely to be done by human operators another explanation would be that there is a group of to spread the risk so to speak update as i think more of it it is not necessary to buy a lot of shares you could buy some shares sell them to another and buy from them again at a higher price in several iterations i think this could also work if you do it fast enough these scheme makes sense only you previously bought many shares at the low price possibly during several weeks once the price is pumped high enough you can start selling the shares you previously bought in the days preceding the pump

some people would think that the government should mandate that walmart pay their employees more    however that wo n't stop other companies from pushing the cost of business unto taxpayers it seems that walmart is acting perfectly rational as a business would   i think the better solution would be to stop enabling these companies with a backdoor subsidy and stop giving out free money and handouts to people when people realize they wo n't get free money from the government they will demand better wages from companies or wo n't bother to work there   the best solution which runs counter intuitive to the previous solution and the one i 'm leaning towards is it is completely transparent and eliminates the need for every other government program then people could work at walmart for fun or walmart could offer a wage that was enticing

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

first of all kudos to you for seeing the value in saving at a young age there are several different things you can mean by this and i 'm not sure which is accurate so i am going to address the first two that i thought of if you are selling your investments because you need the money emergency expenses saved enough for a short term goal whatever the reason then this may not be the best solution for your savings   investing in mutual funds etfs stocks 401k ira etc are typically for longer term goals such as a goal that is 10 + years away maybe buying a home paying for college for your children retirement etc if you are selling your investments because you believe that another investment is performing better and you want to get in on that one instead what i would suggest is leaving the money you have invested where it is and starting future investments in the new fund etf you are interested in   for example if you have $ 2000 invested in fund x and now you do some research and fund q looks more appealing that is great start investing in fund q with your next deposit   any research you do will be based on past results there is nothing that guarantees that fund q will continue doing better than the fund x you already have   trying to time the market rarely ends well for the investor i would encourage you to continue saving money a bit at a time just like you have been doing   avoid selling your investments until it is time to sell them for whatever goal you intended them for   set aside some cash to cover any unexpected expenses so you wo n't have to sell your investments to cover the costs even at 18 unplanned things happen

stock returns can not be evaluated on its own you need to take into account inflation and the return of other investment vehicles over the long run you want to earn more than your peers ie inflation or lose less than them stock lets you buy into the profits of a company managed by others so the fundamental question is do those company managers make better decision than average person of course there are times when they make awful decisions eg just before dotcom bubble and sometimes the best decision is to close the business but overall those people are much better educated have higher iq more etc and so over long time and across all the companies this is correct and hence the stock market premium

generally speaking so called hard assets namely gold or foreign currency durable goods or property that produces income is valuable in a situation where a nation 's money supply is threatened   gold is the universal hard asset if you have access to a decent market you can buy gold as bullion coins and jewelry small amounts are valuable and easy to conceal the problem with gold is that it is often marked up alot i 'm not sure how practical it is in a poor developing nation a substitute would be a harder currency the best choice depends on where you live candidates would be the us dollar euro australian dollar yen etc the right choice depends on you the law in your jurisdiction your means and other factors

there are cases where it makes sense to insure something even if you can bear its loss   insurance is a tool to control risk   one reason you might want to control risk is indeed if you can not afford to bear it 's loss   however there are other reasons you might wish to insure something when you look at your life in totality let 's say you have $ 100 to work with and you have an item a that costs $ 30 perhaps you really need a in your life but its clear here that you can afford to replace it so maybe you do n't insure it   then you get item b which also costs $ 30 and item c which costs $ 30   we can see that you can cover all three of these total value $ 90 so one might argue that you do n't need to insure it now let 's add item d onto the plate also at a cost of $ 30   now you 're in an interesting position with 4 items you depend on a b c and d which have a sum total replacement cost of $ 120   now if all of these break or are stolen you no longer have the funds to replace them   of course what are the odds that all of them break at the same time   you may be able to do the math to determine the probability of going broke and use that to determine whether you want to insure the item or not now consider that you will have to make a similar mathematical analysis for every additional purchase you make   you will also have items which you can bear to lose but you really do n't want to   these can add a large amount of effort to every decision you make   it may be worth getting insurance in such a case   one could think of the purchase in two parts   there is the part that accounts for the statistical expectation of loss and the other is the insurance company 's profits   the profits could be thought of as paying the insurance company for a service which makes it easier for you to think through complicated decisions by removing risk

i do n't follow the numbers in your example but the fundamental question you 're asking is if i can borrow money for a low cost and if i think i can invest it and receive returns greater than that cost should i do it it does n't matter where that money comes from a mortgage that 's bigger than it needs to be a credit card teaser rate or a margin line from your stock broker the answer is maybe depending on the certainty you have about the returns you 'd receive on your investments and your tolerance for risk only you can answer that question for yourself if you make less than your mortgage rates on the investments you 'll wish you had n't as an aside i do n't know anything about belgian tax law but in us tax law your deductions can be limited to the actual value of the home your law may be similar and thus increase the effective mortgage interest rate

it may seem weird but interest rates are set by a market risk is a very large component of the price that a saver will accept to deposit their money in a bank but not the only one essentially you are lending deposited cash to the bank that you put it in and they will lend it out at a certain risk to themselves and a certain risk to you by diversifying who they lend to corporations home buyers each other etc the banks mitigate a lot of the risk but lending to the bank is still a risky endeavour for the saver and the saver accepts a given interest rate for the amount of risk there is in having the money in that particular bank the bank is also unable to diversify away all possible risk but tries to do the best job it can if a bank is seen to take bigger risks and therefore be in greater risk of failing having a run on deposits it must have a higher interest rates on deposits compared to a lower risk bank savers therefore shop around for the best interest rate for a given level of risk which sets the viable interest rate for that bank any higher and the bank would not make a profit on the money that it lends out and so would not be viable as a business any lower and savers would not deposit their money as the risk would be too high for the reward hence competition or lack of it will set the rate as a trade off between risk and return note that governments are also customers of the banking industry when they are issuing fixed income securities bonds and a good deal of the lending done by any bank is to various governments so the price that they borrow money at is a key determinant of what interest rate the bank can afford to give and are part of the competitive banking industry whether they want to be or not since governments in most countries provide insurance for deposits the basic level of perceived risk for all of the banks in any given country is about the same that these banks lend to each other on an incredibly regular basis look into the overnight or repo money market if you want to see exactly how much the rates that these banks pay to and receive from each other are governed by interbank lending rates called libor and and are even more complicated than this answer simply compounds this effect because it makes all of the banks reliant on each other and therefore they help each other to stay liquid to some extent note that i have n't mentioned currency at all so far but this market in every country applies over a number of currencies the way that this occurs is due to arbitrage if i can put foreign money into a bank in a country at a rate that is higher than the rate in its native country after exchange costs and exchange rate risk i will convert all of my money to that currency and take the higher interest rate for an ordinary individual 's savings that is not really possible but remember that the large multinational banks can do exactly the same thing with billions of dollars of deposits and effectively get free money this means that either the bank 's interest rate will fall to a risk adjusted level or the exchange rate will move either of those moves will remove the potential for making money for nothing in this case therefore it is both the exchange rate risk and costs as well as the loan market in that country that set the interest rate in foreign currencies demand for loans in the foreign currency is not a major mover for the same reason companies importing from foreign entities need cash in foreign currencies to pay their bills and so will borrow money in other currencies to fulfil these operations which could come from deposits in the foreign currency if they were available at a lower interest rate than a loan in local currency plus the costs of exchange but the banks will be unwilling to loan to them for less than the highest return that they can get so will push up interest rates to their risk level in the same way that they did in the market before currencies were taken into account freedom of movement of foreign currencies however does move interest rates in foreign currencies as the banks want to be able to lend as much of currencies that are not freely deliverable as they can so will pay a premium for these currencies other political moves such as the government wanting to borrow large amounts of foreign currency etc will also move the interest rate given for foreign currencies not just because loaning to the government is less risky but also because they sometimes pay a premium in interest for being able to borrow foreign currency which may balance this out speculation that a country may change its base interest rate will move short term rates and can move long term rates if it is seen to be a part of a country 's economic strategy the theory behind this is deep and involved but the tl;dr answer would be the standard invisible hand response when anything market or arbitrage related is involved references i work in credit risk and got a colleague who is also a credit risk consultant and economist to look over it arbitrage theory and the repo markets are both fascinating so worth reading about

some lenders want to discourage the borrower from making these additional payments because they want to sell this as a service they might set this up for you or they have a contract with a 3rd party to set it up these services generally charge you to initiate the process and may have a recurring fee they take 1/2 a payment every 2 weeks then forward the money on the first of the month to the lender once a year they will send in the 13th monthly payment this gives them control of up to a months payment per account   there is no law that says they have to accept early payments so check the documents to make sure it is allowed for that mortgage then send in a test payment directing that the excess funds go to pay down principal verify online that the extra funds were credited correctly even it works once the borrower will have to keep checking to make sure it is handled correctly each month

such loans are of course possible they exist because the lender gains something other than interest from them what would happen to the economy if these were common these are common common as anything in fact where it 's not banks lending the money these are the default so nothing would happen to the economy this is one of the ways the economy works all over the world if you 're more interested in a loan from a bank or other financial institution made to you for whatever purpose you want here 's $ 10,000 have fun give it back ten years from now ask yourself what the bank would get from that perhaps they could do it as a perk when you do something else with them like get a mortgage or keep $ 1000 in your chequing account all the time but in the absence of any other relationship what would be their reason for taking on the overhead and paperwork of approving you for a loan and keeping track of whether you 're paying it back or not for no return whether financial or intangible no return it does n't happen

a few reasons make sense they have a defined process for rentals risk assessment and customer credit especially for a large corporation making changes to that process is not trivial adds risk uncertainty and will be costly such changes for a relatively small customer base might not makes sense many rental companies do allow you to rent with a debit card why do some businesses take cash only   with a debit card there is no third party guarantee with a credit card the cash is coming from a well established third party who will pay assuming no disputes and has a well established history of paying even if the merchant holds your account it is still your cash under the control of you and your bank until the deposit clears the merchants bank it is not surprising they view that as more risk and potentially not worth with debit

if you are looking for money to speculate in the capital markets then your brokers will already lend to you at a much more favorable rate than an outside party will for instance with $ 4,000 you could easily control $ 40,000 with many brokers at a 1 interest rate this is 10:1 leverage much like how us banks operate every dollar that you deposit with them they speculate with 10x as much interactive brokers will do this for you with your current credit score they are very reputable and clear through goldman sachs so although reputable is subjective in the investment banking world you wo n't have to worry the federal government raiding them or anything if you are investing in currencies than you can easily do 50:1 leverage as an american or as anyone else this means with only $ 400 dollars you can control $ 40,000 account if you are investing in the futures market then there are many many ways to double and triple and quadruple your leverage at the lowest interests rates any contract you enter into is a loan from the market you have to understand that if you did happen to have $ 40,000 of your own money then you could get $ account size for speculating at 1 interest again these are quick ways to lose your money and owe a lot more so i 'd really advise against it a margin call in the futures market can destroy you i advise you to just think more efficiently until you come up with a way to earn that much money initially and then speculate

you probably want to think about pools of money separately if they have separate time horizons or are otherwise not interchangeable a classic example is your emergency fund which has a potentially immediate time horizon vs. your retirement savings the emergency fund would be all in cash or very short term bonds and would not count in your retirement asset allocation since the emergency fund usually has a capped value a certain amount of money you want to have for emergencies rather than a percentage of net worth value this especially makes sense you have to treat the emergency fund separately or you 'd have to keep changing your asset allocation percentages as your net worth rises hopefully with respect to the capped emergency amount similarly say you are saving for a car in 3 years you 'd probably invest that money very conservatively also it could not go in tax deferred retirement accounts and when you buy the car the account will go to zero so probably worth treating this separately on the other hand say you have some savings in tax deferred retirement accounts and some in taxable accounts but in both cases you 're expecting to use the money for retirement in that case you have the same time horizon and goals and it can pay to think about the taxable and nontaxable accounts as a whole in particular you can use asset location put less tax efficient assets in tax deferred accounts in this case maybe you would end up with mostly bonds in the tax deferred accounts and mostly equities in the taxable accounts for tax reasons the asset allocation would only make sense considering all the accounts since the taxable account would be too equity heavy and the tax deferred one too bond heavy there can be practical reasons to treat each account separately too though for example if your broker has a convenient automatic rebalancing tool on their website it probably only works within an account treating each account by itself would let you use the automatic rebalancing feature on the website while a more complicated asset location strategy where you rebalance across multiple accounts might be too hard and in practice you would n't get around to it getting around to rebalancing could be more important than tax motivated asset location you could also take a keep it simple attitude as long as your asset allocation is pretty balanced say 40 bonds and includes a cash allocation that would cover emergencies you could just put all your money in one big portfolio and think of it as a whole if you have an emergency withdraw from the cash allocation and then rebuild it over time if you have a major purchase you could redeem some bonds and then rebuild the bond portion over time when i say over time i 'm thinking you might start putting new contributions into the now assets or you might dollar cost average back into them by selling bits of the now assets anyway there 's no absolute rule it depends on what 's simple enough to be manageable for you in practice and what separate shorter horizon investing goals you have in addition to retirement you can always make things complex but remember that a simple plan that happens in real life is better than a complex plan you do n't keep up with in practice or a complex plan that takes away from activities you 'd enjoy more

saving money for the future is a good thing   whether spending those savings on a business venture makes sense will depend on a few factors including 1 how much money you need that business to make ie will you be quitting your job and relying on the business for your sole income or will this just be a hobby you make some pocket change from 2 how much the money the business needs up front some businesses like simple web design consulting might have effectively $ 0 in cash startup costs where starting a franchise restaurant might cost you $ m on day 1 3 how risky it is the general stat is that something like 50 of all new businesses fail in their first year and i think for restaurants that number is often given as so sometimes investing in your own business is financially risky and other times it is not risky sometimes it is a good idea sometimes it is not either way saving for a future business that you may or may not ever invest in is still saving money if you never end up investing in a business you can instead use that money for retirement or whatever other financial goals you have so it 's not the saving for a new business that is risky it 's the spending part of good personal financial management is making financial goals tracking your progress to those goals and changing them as needed in a simpler case many people want to own their own home this is a common financial goal just like early retirement or starting your own business or paying for your kids college education all those goals are helped by saving money so your job as someone mindful of personal finances is to prioritize those goals in accordance to what is important for you as mentioned by in the comments below there is one catch here if you are saving money for a short term goal such as starting a business in a year then you might want to keep it in low interest savings accounts instead of investing in the stock market doing this would remove the chance that your investments fail right before you need the startup money of course this means that saving for a business that you never end up starting could earn you less investment income on your savings this would be the risk of saving for any specific short term goal that you end up changing later on

as someone who 's currently shopping for some winter wheels and has the raised blood pressure to go with that i 've got a few suggestions as to what would make me pick up the phone and call your or email you if you 're advertising a vehicle keep in mind that if you 're willing to deal with the additional hassle you 'll normally get the most money for a used car if you sell it privately if it is worth the additional effort though is both a matter of judgement and if you 're willing to put up with strange people like me depending on the value of the vehicle and its rarity desirability you 're looking at newspaper ads probably wo n't get you much of a response these days craigslist and similar and last but not least ebay if you 're trying to sell something that 's easy to find because there are five at every street corner think minivan skip ebay if it 's worth below i would n't bother with places where you have to pay to advertise which leaves cl for the cheap stuff that said i 'd still stick it on cl if it 's advertised in other places heck it 's free after all the figure out what sort of money you 're asking for check the resources like and have a look at your local cl for similar vehicles out here certain types of vehicles for example sell quickly and often above even a little market research will help you come up with a good price just do n't do things like asking a massively inflated price for a vehicle because you paid $ x five years ago all this shows that you have no idea what your vehicle is worth oh and i 'd always work out what the minimum i 'd take is leave yourself some haggle room but do n't the vehicle once you know where you advertise and for how much pull together the basic facts for your vehicles and the points that would make it stand out basic facts about the car should include engine size type of transmission if it 's awd where applicable mileage color i can see on the pictures but it 's nice to include that too if you have service records recently replaced a big ticket item think transmission or similar or had a very recent service especially a big one where you had a timing belt and changed mention it do n't say the vehicle has a new engine if that was put in 100k miles ago that 's nice to mention but it 's not new if nobody 's ever smoked in it mention it if it 's got other outstanding features super low mileage summer only use etc make sure to mention it that too next if it 's got any faults that you know of especially obvious ones disclose them people like me will most likely find the leaking shock and the rust holes in the floor anyway and it makes a much better impression if you do tell us about them beforehand trying to tell someone that your banana shaped car that looks like the blue man group used it for practise is actually pristine and accident free is n't going to go down very well next pull together the paperwork make sure you 've got the title if there is a lien on the title check with the lienholder before advertising the car so you know their procedure for releasing the title any maintenance records you have manuals receipts etc if the vehicle has a salvage title try to find out why and mention it in the ad i 've just had a comedian phone me while i was driving to see his vehicle and leave a message that he did n't have a title and did n't seem to be willing to bother to get one either obviously that put me in the right frame of mind given that it was a 200 mile round trip so do n't do it if you ca n't get a title the schmuck you sold it to will have even less of a chance of getting one and given that you are in california a lot of people including myself react really badly to three years worth of back registration missing expired registrations on something i 'd expect to test drive etc essentially anything that would stop a potential cash buyer to drive it away on the spot next clean the car you know the five years of accumulated mcd and inch thick layer of dirt i 'm only partially kidding i 've seem some pretty horrible stuff recently spend the two hours it takes to clean it or pay to have it or detailed clean shiny cars sell a lot better than a rolling recycling container oh and last make the effort take some decent photos the more the shot in daylight no a black car after sunset and if there is any damage an additional photo or two showing the damage would be nice stick the on or similar and put the links in your craigslist ad so you do n't restrict yourself to the photos that you normally get on there as to payment i 'd either take cash meet the buyer at his bank where he draws out a cashiers check in front of your eyes or well cash no deeds on bridges in brooklyn or anything else be prepared to take a deposit a lot of buyers are n't willing to wander around with ten large ones in the back pocket to go look at a car and spell out exactly how long the deposit is good for i also tend to make them non refundable buyer does n't pick up the car within the negotiated timeframe you keep the deposit as damages for not being able to sell it to another cash buyer check your dmv 's website as to what exactly you need to do once you sold the car here in nevada it 's the buyer 's problem on how to move it as you keep the plates but i know in california the regular plates not personal ones iirc stay with the vehicle and i think you need to inform the dmv that you sold the vehicle i 'd also keep a record of who i sold a vehicle to name address from his drivers license license number etc just in case they run a few red lights and accumulate a few worth of parking tickets

you 're looking for the amortization calculation this calculation is essentially solving for the series of cash flows that will yield a zero balance after the specified term at the given rate for a loan amount once you have solved for the payment amount you can add additional principal amount to each payment period and see the interest payments and time to zero balance drop

some sample prices for straightforward pay for hours or planners i think i 've seen some similar rates elsewhere too i 'd feel like you might get something and boilerplate for too much less than $ 1000 how could the person afford to spend much time and i 'd feel like lots more than $ 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff basically you 're paying $ 1000 for a day or two of work you do n't want just a couple hours of work but you do n't need a week of work either anyway extracting the general guideline since prices may vary or over time you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it from there you can decide what 's fair adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues this is assuming you 're paying for time and which is not a given the biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models there are other models but these are the ones i 've seen most the difference between these two models is a lot of money over time hourly is going to be much cheaper because it 's a one time cost instead of ongoing and unrelated to what you have in assets however you wo n't get investment management which can be valuable if you are n't the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you the investment management planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money hourly planners do n't really have as good a business from a business owner 's perspective but they are cheaper from a customer perspective as long as you 're happy to diy a bit one thing i like about hourly planners is that i do n't really feel investments are the main place planners can add value so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that insurance estate planning taxes etc are where it 's harder for a to know all the ins and outs and diy from what i 've seen the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like usaa or vanguard if you have an account with them however they will only recommend products from the company in question so that 's a downside and you probably wo n't get to meet them in person this question may be useful too what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

i 'd put more money down and avoid financing i personally do n't think car debt is good debt and if you ca n't afford the car you are better off with a cheaper car also you should read up on the 0 offer before deciding to commit    here 's one article that is slightly dated but discusses some pros and cons of 0 financing my main point though is that 0 financing is not free and you need to consider the cost of that financing before making the purchase   aside from the normal loan costs of having a monthly payment possibly buying too much car by looking at monthly cost etc a 0 financing offer usually forces you to give the dealer financing company any rebates that are due to you in essence making the car cost more

there are many variables to this answer one is how close are you to the average salary range in the industry you are working in if you are making more than average it would make sense that you are not getting a big raise from the employer 's perspective you have to be a top performer if you are looking for the top salary range big raises come from promotions or new jobs generally speaking   the short and personal answer is i worked at a big company bank and now know that companies do not give large raises to people as a rule   honestly the only way to make good $ is to leave all employers have all kinds of excuses as to why they are not giving you significant raises large raises and bonuses are reserved for management the bigger the company the less likely it is that they will give you raises just because esp above 3 5 at the same time the market sets the rate and if you are not getting passively recruited it may mean that you need to work on getting a broader skill set if you are looking to make more $ somewhere else the bottom line is you have to think of yourself as a free agent at all times you also need to make yourself more attractive as a potential hire elsewhere

he offered a 15 stake   he showed willingness to move from his original position by moving to 20   this left the door open for further discussions but if the last shark was n't offering royalties or something else to sweeten the pot he was n't going to budge much more than maybe to 22.5   you give away too much too easily and a seasoned negotiator smells blood and goes for it   every round of negotiations needs to offer a bit more but less than the additional offered in the previous round and not without receiving something in return so after increasing by 5 to 20 he would not have added another 35 based on their arguments he would reason why an additional 2.5 would be the most he could offer without additional consideration if he jumped from 15 to say 40 too easily the other negotiator would be looking for an additional 20 after that   so he went from 15 to 20 in response to the 75 equity stake and did nothing to seem or unreasonable while setting the tone for the next and last negotiator   the last guy was n't willing to walk away and showed that he was n't going to be pushed into a bad deal so a deal got done   dunno if that makes sense but his assertions coupled with strong but fair negotiating skills and a product that at least one person saw value in or any negotiation would be pointless won the day

here 's what i 'd do   show these figures to your bank and ask if they can offer you some type of account with a small overdraft say up to $ 2000   typically this wo n't pay the same kind of interest as your savings account but it does n't matter if such an account is available then yes dump most of your savings into the student loan and keep a few hundred in your new account   the overdraft on this account is your emergency fund   this means that in the more likely scenario no emergencies you 're saving yourself 6 interest on something like $ 4000 to $ 4500   in the case of an emergency you 're still covered but you 'll be paying a larger amount of interest   let 's say you have an emergency cost and need to dip into the overdraft for $ 1000   if the interest is 15 then you 've cost yourself an extra 9 on that $ 1000 over leaving that debt in the student loan   this seems to me like a really good gamble more likely to gain 6 of $ 4000 less likely to lose 9 of $ 1000 if your bank wo n't give you a low interest account with a small overdraft then use your credit card as your emergency fund   the same kind of logic applies but since credit card interest rates are typically higher than overdraft interest rates you 'll want to keep slightly more in your savings account   about $ 1200 to $ 1500 feels right to me and move the remaining $ 3500 to $ 3800 to your student loan    so yes pay off the student loan   that 6 interest really is worth having even if you 'd be taking a small gamble edit alexander has suggested that i should compare this to matched retirement plans   the 100 gain in a matched retirement plan is n't 100 per annum it 's 100 divided across the length of time you have to wait until you can get your hands on that money   suppose the money is accessible when you turn 60 a matched plan is a good deal if you 're in your 50 's but not so good if you 're in your 20 's   the 100 matching is equivalent to 6 interest per annum compounded over slightly under 12 years    so if you 're less than 12 years away from retiring go for the matched plan   otherwise pay off your student loan first

basically you need to use a time value of money equation to discount the cashflows back to today the wikipedia formula will likely work fine for you then you just need to pick an effective interest rate to use in the calculation run each of your amounts and dates though the formula there are various on line calculators to pick from and sum up the values you did not mention your location or jurisdiction but a useful proxy for the interest rate would be the average between the same duration mortgage rate and fixed deposit rate at your bank it should be close enough for your purposes although if an actual lawsuit is involved and the sums high enough to have lawyers it might be worth engaging an accountant as well to defend the of both the calculation and the interest rates chosen

so let 's assume some values to better explain this   for simplicity all of these are in thousands so in this example you 're going to destroy $ 250 in value pay off the existing $ 150 loan and have to invest $ 300 in to build the new house and this example does n't have enough equity to cover it   you typically ca n't get a loan for much more than the anticipated property value basically you need to get a construction loan to cover paying off the existing loan plus whatever you want to spend to pay for the new house minus whatever you 're planning to contribute from savings   this new loan will need to be for less than the new total market value   the only way this will work out this way is if you bring significant cash to closing or you owe less than the lot value on the current property note that this is in effect a simplification   you can spend less building a house than it 's worth when you 're done with it etc but this is the basic way it would work or not work in most cases

you should really be talking to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state about taxes and to a lawyer about the liability protection you wo n't find answers from neither of theses here besides the liability protection how do these 2 options affect taxes there 's no liability protection difference between the two talk to a lawyer to verify since you 'll be cosigning them personally either way in the first case loan to the llc everything goes on the 1065 and you get the bottom line on k-1 which transfers to you own tax return in the second case the loan interest is your personal investment expense schedule a deduction while the loan proceeds you moved to the llc add to your basis i 'd suggest getting the loan directly in the llc name if you can however the lawyers seem to agree that this would void the mortgage    because of the due on sale clause in mortgage loans due on sale may or may not be but that 's a risk you 'd be taking yes llc is a separate legal entity as opposed to a living trust to which your second quote seems to be referring so it is definitely a possibility for a lender to call on the loan if you re title it

there is nothing legal you can do in the united states to avoid the tax burden of income earned as an employee other than offsetting it with pre tax contributions which it sounds like you 're already doing making charitable contributions or incurring investment losses which is cutting off your nose to spite your face   so that $ 660 k ca n't be helped as for the $ 80 k in stock dividends you could move those investments into growth companies rather than value companies   growth companies are those that pay less in dividends where the primary increase in wealth occurs only in share price increase   this puts off your tax bill until you finally sell your shares and depending on how the tax laws are at that time your tax bill will be lower on those capital gains than they are currently on these dividends regarding rental income i know nothing but i think you 're entitled to depreciate your property 's value over time and count that against the taxes you owe on the rents   and you can deduct all the upkeep expenses   as with employment income intentionally incurring rental losses to lower your tax bill is not logical   for every dollar you earn you only have to give about 50 cents to the government whereas for every dollar you lose you 've lost a dollar

you have 2 concerns the lender and the irs either way you should be fine the lender just wants to know that you have no legal claim to the property or other compensation simply signing a gift declaration should clear that up making this a gift from their perspective   they probably have some standard form you can sign otherwise just a simple note that says i so and so gave er name x$ on the y of june 20 as a gift with no expectation of repayment   then only way you could get charged with fraud is if you seek compensation for this gift in the future   even then the bank would probably have to find out about the compensation and complain pretty strongly to get a prosecutor interested in a small dollar misrepresentation case with little or no provable intent a bigger concern is the bank being uncomfortable with the future renter also giving a gift that just smells weird and bankers hate anything weird it probably wo n't prevent the mortgage from getting approved but it might delay the underwriters a few days while the wring their hands about it the irs is a bit more complicated they tend to be the heads we win tails you lose types   assuming they consider this a gift then you are fine since it is under the annual gift exclusion these days you do n't even have to tell them about it   however if she gives you a large financial gift in the near future they may decide to interpret those two events as a single transaction turning this into a no interest loan even then you should be fine since the irs generally does n't care about loans under with missing interest under since this is a small loan and interest rates are so low you have no worries further irs reading on gift loans

lyft is n't farther behind because they want to take care of their employees they 're farther behind because they 've raised less money because they were second to market both are running at a loss trying to grow but uber 's got more cash so it has expanded farther lyft has taken the high road to build its brand and because uber 's made it easy uber has out into other service parcel and food delivery in order to build its brand and grow further both companies realize they 're in a commodity industry there is little non price differentiation in the service provided and they need to achieve massive scale so that they can start to turn a profit but right now it 's uber 's game to lose at least between the two of them somebody else getting a large lead in self driving cars could crush both of them pretty quickly

many of my friends turn to me for financial advice and here 's what i always tell them because it 's super effective for me 1 i opened an online bank account with scottrade for which i did not request a card or checks i set up direct deposit straight to that account it would be a complicated pain to take money out of that savings the only time i did so was to buy my house which was the purpose of the savings and it involved a wire transfer and printing of the form to fill out and it in etc i have continued to use the account to save for my second house i basically completely forget that the account is even there or that i am missing a large chunk of my money 2 it is very important to actually budget for spending money to continue to spend on impulse items basically allow yourself to spend money on yourself but in a controlled way decide a specific amount that you want to put in a separate account that is just for you to spend to your hearts content and have it direct deposit i find and dave ramsey also encourages this that when i know how much money i am going to blow i feel much more in control and it causes me to not get carried away and blow more than i realized take this a step further decide specifically what you want to buy for yourself and label the account accordingly for example i decided back in march that i wanted to buy an xbox one for when star wars comes out this november i calculated exactly how much money i would need at that time figured how many paychecks i would receive until then and did the math to determine exactly how much i need to direct deposit into an account just for saving to buy the xbox and game i use and i can actually rename the account as it is displayed so i called it xbox fund seeing that title a reminder of what i really want encourages me to not touch it what is your goal behind wanting to save money better what are you saving for label your account accordingly so you do n't just see it as money but as progress

i used to think that paying off ahead of time made sense but i no longer do at least in most cases   the upside is that you can get a return on your money equal to the mortgage interest rate it 's less than that in the us where mortgage interest is deductible so it 's roughly the mortgage interest rate 1 your marginal income tax rate   there are a few downsides the biggest is that cash is the most liquid asset you can have you can get at it with no restrictions if you put that cash into your house you are converting that into an asset with a lot of restrictions you ca n't get at it without fees nor can you get at it if you do n't have a job which is when you would need it most   so you are putting your money in a hard to get at place for a small interest rate i do n't think it is worthwhile edit one complication is pmi if you are currently paying pmi it may make sense to put money towards the mortgage until you get to 20 and can get rid of the pmi

let 's take a step back my fictional company a is a solid old established company it 's in consumer staples so people buy the products in good times and bad it has a dividend of $ only knowing this you have to decide how much you would be willing to pay for one share   you might decide that $ 20 is fair why because that 's a 5 return on your money 1/20 = 5 and given the current rates you 're happy for a 5 dividend but this company does n't give out all its earnings as a dividend it really earns $ 1.50 so the p e you are willing to pay is or   many companies offer no dividend but of course they still might have earnings and the p e is one metric that used to judge whether one wishes to buy a stock   a high p e implies the buyers think the stock will have future growth and they are to pay more today to hold it a low p e might be a sign the company is solid but not growing if such a thing is possible

you have a sequence of questions here so a sequence of answers if you stopped at the point where you had multiple wins with a net profit of $ 72 then you would pay regular income tax on that $ 72 it 's a short term capital gain which does not get special tax treatment and the fact that you made it on multiple transactions does not matter when you enter your next transaction that takes the hypothetical loss the question gets more complicated in either case you are paying a percentage on net gains   if you took a two year view in the second case and you do n't have anything to offset your loss in the second year then i guess you could say that you paid more tax than you won in the total sequence of trades over the two years although you picked a sequence of trades where it does not appear to play if you 're going to pursue this type of strategy then you are likely at some point to run into a case where the wash sale rules apply so you should be aware of that   you can find information on this elsewhere on this site and also for example here   basically these rules require you to defer recording a loss under some circumstances where you have rapid wins and losses on substantially identical securities edit a slight correction you can take part of your losses in the second year even if you have no off setting gain   from the irs if your capital losses exceed your capital gains the amount of the excess loss that you can claim on line 13 of form 1040 to lower your income is the lesser of $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if you are married filing separately

i have done this for years and have been quite successful at it two reason i even need to do this desire to pay for engagement ring and pay for 150 person wedding without using my nest egg savings   you need to keep a document that details when the free aprs run out and you need to setup automatic payments of the minimum balance from your checking account so you ensure you do not miss a payment   you need to understand when you are going to need to make big purchases of homes apartments cars so that you can ensure you are n't doing this right before your credit score is being checked need to leave 12 months without opening new accounts before doing this   i have been able to finance about $ 60,000 worth of unsecured debt paying between 3 5 interest per year we have an unsecured credit line with citibank that charges 14 and is capped at $ 10,000 and discover personal loans charge around 14 as well in pre paid interest   i would say all things considering that this is a great deal if you do n't have a secured line of credit with a low interest rate   it is something however that if you are n't diligent can get away from you from my experience i would rather pay a small amount of interest while allowing my savings and retirement to grow interest hopefully greater than 3 5 than pay the huge expense and start from zero but if you miss a single payment on a 0 apr balance transfer they charge you all back interest concessions plus charge you a penalty rate   like many of the other posts you need discipline to make this work

gold ownership has been outlawed before in this country   however if you research it i think you 'll find that there are two components in pricing gold coins   the spot value of gold   the value of the coin in question   that second point is where you get fucked   there are a whole lot of outfits selling worthless investment grade coins that sell for way more than they should based on gold content and for way more than any coin collector would ever give you for the value of the coin itself   but it 's much harder to find a reasonable price for some supposedly rare coin than it is for the metal itself so it 's easier to scam you   so it 's in the best interest of the guys that advertise for these firms to say buying rare coins is awesome and buying straight gold is stupid   me   if i want to buy going coins i 'll buy us gold for a small percentage over the spot price   they 're probably more liquid than some random chunk of metal that says it 's oz of gold

as mentions you would have to decide what type of properties you would like to invest in are you after negatively geared properties that may have higher long term growth potential usually within 15 to 20 km from major cities or after positive cash flow properties which may have a lower long term growth potential usually located more than 20 km from major cities   with negative geared properties your rent from the property will not cover the mortgage and other costs so you will have to supplement it through your income the theory is that you can claim a tax deduction on your employment income from the negative gearing benefits mainly those on higher tax brackets and the potential long term growth of the property will make up for the negative gearing over the long term   if you are after these type of properties michael has some books on the subject on the other hand positive cash flow properties provide enough rental income to cover the mortgage and other costs they put cash into your pockets each week they do n't have as much growth potential as more inner city properties but if you stick to the outer regions of major cities instead of rural towns you will still achieve decent long term growth if you are after these type of properties margaret has some books on the subject my preference is for cash flow positive properties and some of the areas has mentioned i am personally invested in the and surrounding areas   with negatively geared properties you generally have to supplement the property with your own income and generally have to wait for the property price to increase so you build up equity in the property this then allows you to refinance the additional equity so you can use it as deposits to buy other properties or to supplement your income the problem is if you go through a period of low stagnate or negative growth you may have to wait quite a few years for your equity to increase substantially with positively geared properties you are getting a net income from the property every week so using none of your other income to supplement the property you can thus afford to buy more properties sooner and even if the properties go through a period of low stagnate or negative growth you are still getting extra income each week over the long term these properties will also go up and you will have the benefit of both passive income and capital gains i also agree with regarding doing at least 6 months of research in the area s you are looking to buy visit open homes attend auctions talk to real estate agents and get to know the area this kind of research will beat any information you get from websites books and magazines you will find that when a property comes onto the market you will know what it is worth and how much you can offer below asking price another thing to consider is when to buy most people are buying now in australia because of the record low interest rates below 5 this is causing higher demand in the property markets and prices to rise steadily many people who buy during this period will be able to afford the property when interest rates are at 5 but as the housing market and the economy heat up and interest rates start rising they find it hard to afford the property when interest rate rise to 7 8 or higher i personally prefer to buy when interest rates are on the rise and when they are near their highs during this time no one wants to touch property with a six foot pole but all the owners who bought when interest rates where much lower are finding it hard to keep making repayments so they put their properties on the market there ends up being low demand and increased supply causing prices to fall it is very easy to find bargains and negotiate lower prices during this period because interest rates will be near or at their highs the economy will be starting to slow down so it will not be long before interest rates start dropping again if you can afford to buy a property at 8 you will definitely be able to afford it at 6 or lower plus you would have bought at or near the lows of the price cycle just before prices once again start increasing as interest rates drop read and learn as much as possible from others but in the end make up your own mind on the type of properties and areas you prefer

i would differentiate between pricing and valuation a bit more   valuation is the result of investment analysis and the result of coming up with a fair value for a company and its shares this is done usually by equity analysts i have never heard about pricing a security in this context pricing would indicate that the price of a product or security is set by someone i.e. a car manufacturer sets the prices of its new cars the price of a security however is not set by an analyst or an institution it is solely set by the stock market perhaps based on the valuations of different analysts   there is only one exception to this pricing an ipo before its shares are actually traded on an exchange in this case the underwriting banks set the price based on the valuation at which the shares are distributed

you need to do the maths exactly the cost of buying a car in cash and using a loan is not the same the dealership will often get paid a significant amount of money if you get a loan through them on the other hand they may have a hold over you if you need their loan no cash and the bank wo n't give you money   one strategy is that while you discuss the price with the dealer you indicate that you are going to get a loan through them and then when you 've got the best price for the car that 's when you tell them it 's cash remember that the car dealer will do what 's best for their finances without any consideration of what 's good for you so you are perfectly in your rights to do the same to them

exactly   i mean angel investors can be great but you should n't be doing that unless you already have a proven model and revenue stream i think an angel investor that would give someone money for an idea at the stage of having made $ 0 is n't really aware of what they 're doing and they 're probably a friend or family that you may most likely end up letting down

reddit has always had a thing for nuclear there was a period of time when there were more reddit posts about reactors than there are posts about tesla motors now   the main point that is ignored is that nuclear is more expensive than natural gas after considering the building cost   on an aside the post you made sort of proves his point there is an arguably weird stigma attached to supporting nuclear

i 'm reminded of a conversation i had regarding food i used the word diet and got pushback as i meant it in sense of what one eats that 's what a diet is what you eat in an average week month year that list has no hidden agenda unless you want it to if your finances are in good shape debt under control savings growing etc a budget is more of an observation than a constraint in the same way that my bookshelf tells you a lot about who i am books on finance math my religion along with some on english and humor my budget will also tell you what my values are   edit in a recent speech regarding joe biden hillary clinton said he has a saying do n’t tell me what you value show me your budget and i will tell you what you nearly exactly my thoughts on this   for the average person a budget helps to reign in the areas where spending is too high $ 500/mo eating out for the couple hacking away at $ 30k in credit card debt that would be an obvious place to cut back if this brings you happiness there 's little reason to cut back the budget becomes a reflection of your priorities and if at some point in the future you need to cut back you 'll have a good understanding of where the money is going

the simplest way is to invest in a few etfs depending on your tolerance for risk assuming you 're very short term risk tolerant you can invest almost all in a stock etf like voo or vti   stock market etfs return close to 10 unadjusted over long periods of time which will out earn almost any other option and are very easy for a non finance person to invest in you do n't trade actively you leave the money there for years   if you want to hedge some of your risk you can also invest in bond funds which tend to move up in stock market downturns but if you 're looking for the long term you do n't need to put much there otherwise try to make sure you take advantage of tax breaks when you can iras 401ks etc most of those will have etfs whether vanguard or similar available to invest in   look for funds that have low expense ratios and are fairly diversified ie do n't just invest in one small sector of the economy as long as the economy continues to grow the etfs will grow

the fact that your shares are of a canadian listed corporation as indicated in your comment reply and that you are located in the united states as indicated in your bio is highly relevant to answering the question the restriction for needing to be a qualified institutional buyer arises from the parent company not having registered the spin off company rights options or shares yet for sale in the united states shares sold in the u.s. must either be registered with the sec or qualify for some exemption see sec fast answers securities act rule 144 quoting selling restricted or control securities in the marketplace can be a    complicated process this is because the sales are so close to the    interests of the issuing company that the law might require them to be    registered under section 5 of the securities act of 1933 all offers    and sales of securities must be registered with the sec or qualify for    some exemption from the registration requirements there are regulations to follow and costs involved in such registration perhaps the rights options themselves wo n't ever be registered as they have a very limited lifetime while the listed shares might be you could contact investor relations at the parent company for more detail if i guessed the company correctly there 's detail in this press release search the text for united states

volume is measured in the number of shares traded in a given day week month etc this means that it 's not necessarily a directly comparable measure between stocks as there 's a large difference between 1 million shares traded of a $ 1 stock $ 1 million total and 1 million shares traded of a $ 1000 stock $ 1 billion total volume as a number on its own is lacking in context it often makes more sense to look at it as an overall dollar amount as in the above or as a fraction of the total number of shares in the marketplace when you see a price quoted for a particular ticker symbol whether online or on tv or elsewhere that price is typically the price of the last trade that executed for that security a good proxy for the current fair price of an asset is what someone else paid for it in the recent past as long as it was n't too long ago so when you see a quote labeled 15.5 k $ 60.00 that means that the last trade on that security which the service is using to quote the security 's price was for shares at a price of $ 60 per share your guess is correct the term institutional investor often is meant to include many types of institutions that would control large sums of money this includes large banks insurance companies pooled retirement funds hedge funds and so on

part 1 quite a few or rather most countries allow usd account so there is no conversion    just to in india its allowed to have a usd account the funds can be transfered as usd and withdrawn as usd the interest is in usd there no conversion at any point in time typically the rates for cd on usd account was central bank regulated rate of 5 recently this was deregulated and some banks offer around 7 interest    why is the rate high on usd in india there is a trade deficit which means india gets less usd and has to pay more usd to buy stuff oil and other essential items the balance is typically borrowed say from imf or other countries etc allowing banks to offer high interest rate is one way to attract more usd into the country in short term because in time they may take back the usd out of india so why is n't everyone jumping and making usd in india the non residents who eventually plan to come back have invested in usd in india there is a risk of regulation changes ie if the central bank country comes up pressure for forex reserves they may make it to take back the usd ie they may impose charges taxes or force conversion on such accounts the kyc norms make it difficult for indian bank to attract us citizens except non resident indians certain countries would have explicit regulations to prevent other nationals from investing in such products as they may lead to volatility ie all of them suddenly pull out the funds there would be no insurance to foreign nationals    part 2 the fdic insurance is not the reason for lower rates most countires have similar insurance for bank deposits for account    the reason for lower rate is all the china etc park the excess funds in us treasuries because 1 it is safe 2 it is required for any international purchase 3 it is very liquid    now if the us fed started giving higher interest rates to bonds say 5 it essentially paying more to other countries so its keeping the interest rates low even at 1 there are enough people institutions who would keep the money with us treasury    so the us treasury has to make some revenue from the funds kept at it it lends at lower interest rates to bank who in turn lend it to borrowers both corporate and retail    now if they can borrow cheaply from fed why would they pay more to individual retail on cd they will pay less because the lending rates are low as well    part 3 check out the regulations

firstly currency prices like any asset depend on supply and demand meaning how many people want to exchange a currency to another one vs. wanting to buy that currency using another currency secondly it really depends on which country and economy you are talking about in emerging economies currencies are very often influenced by the politics of that country in cases like the us there are a myriad reasons the usd is mostly governed by psychology flight to safety and asset purchases sales in theory currencies balance given the inflation of a country and its trade with other countries e.g. germany which was always exporting more than it was importing had the problem of a rising currency which would make its exports more expensive on foreign markets this is the balancing act

here 's my crude reasoning let 's say you have just one recently acquired credit card with a $ 5000 limit the company that issued the credit card set the $ 5000 limit based on however they assessed your risk now if you 're using a significant portion of of the $ 5000 limit it means at least for them that you are stretching your wallet even if you 've been paying monthly consistently and since you are heavily using your limit it also means that if you lose your primary source of money for even one month income etc then your risk to the lender increases sharply had you been making more money compared to this $ 5000 limit then either you 'd have used less of your available credit or you would've gotten your limits raised by asking your bank to re evaluate your risk and increase the limit also your statement why is a us credit score based on credit utilization is slightly incorrect as per fico credit utilization has 35 weight while your payment history has a weight of 35 to sum it up we can debate if the weight for credit utilization should be higher or lower but unfortunately as others have pointed out these scores are meant to help lenders not consumers so whether we like it or not the secret algorithms to calculate the scores and the actual weights variables and rules they use are completely out of our hands

social media and word of mouth are going to be your best friends build yourself a good reputation for quality and good social skills hair designing is a big part of your job but so is socializing you have to build relationships with people in the service industry to keep them coming back as a general point    my suggestion is to focus on the clientele you have remaining and strengthen your relationship with them they will pass on the word of how well you 're doing and how they really like to use you    in the mean time to build more clientele try taking to social media share photos of your work with your clients permission and offer special deals for people who follow you maybe offer 50 off the first visit for the next 5 new clients or something like that yeah you 're going to earn less money on those clients for those visits but you may gain a long term client or 2 out of the deal    if that fails you might try to get on with an established salon through a place like jc penny or great clips something like that until you can build a bigger clientele    all of the successful hair designers i know have several things in common talented great pricing nice atmosphere and a killer ongoing portfolio    good luck

bankers home builders and real estate people made a lot of money selling more houses than they should have   to sell that many houses they had to lie and let people without good jobs buy houses that cost too much then the jobs went away and the people lost their way of paying for their house   now there are still all those houses and still no jobs   it is called a bubble because it was planned   it was no accident even the part about jobs going away   the rich people knew what was happening the jobs began to go away in the early 1970 's   the plan in part was to make as much money as they could before too many people lost their jobs   no jobs means no customers and no more easy money

as the other answer already states whether you should or should n't currency hedge your equity investments depends on a lot of factors if you decide to do so depending on your investment vehicles there might be a more cost efficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank if you are open to or are already investing in etfs there are currency hedged versions of some popular etfs these are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency for example if you are buying in and expecting to sell for usd you would buy an etf hedged to usd of course they have a higher expense ratio than non hedged etfs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses

equity means having ownership and i think that 's a really bad idea in the scenario that you described   if you stay together there 's really no upside to either of you in this scheme   if you break up then you 'll have a terrible mess especially if the break up goes badly   if she 's really building equity you 're going to be faced with several hard questions if this went bad at the end it might be worse than a divorce in some sense since at least in the divorce you have established law to sort out the issues   you 'll be on your own here without a formal contract marriage being a special case of a contract for our purposes here if she wants to share costs which seems perfectly fair then agree to rent and a split on utilities   if you really insist on going down the path that you described i think that you 'll need some sort of contract which probably involves a lawyer   anything short of that could not be considered having equity at all and will be completely unenforceable in the event of a bad break up there is some notion of a verbal contract but that 's very hard to prove and subject to misunderstanding and aside from all of these potential problems in event of a break up you would probably also be violating the terms of your mortgage if you have one from the bank 's perspective you are selling the property that is the collateral for that loan which you 're almost surely not allowed to do

nobody owes anyone else a living or preservation of a business model   creative wiki is good for progress   note that it is already the case that physical retailers charge less online for picking up the exact same item in the same store   for example walmart will sell you an ipod touch for $ for same day pickup but if you walked into the store and bought it from the shelves they charge $ 199   i do n't use amazon because i 'm probably one of the only honest californians and do n't want the hassle of working out use taxes   if amazon did collect sales tax i would consider them   the correct solution is of course to get rid of sales tax everywhere as it imposes a huge burden to collect and is wiki

no it means that is only the notional value of that underlying asset of that contract generally the contract specification itself is listed on the exchange 's websites and there are really no assumptions you can make about a particular contract where s&p futures have one set of specifications such as what it actually represents how many each contract holds how to price profits and losses a different contract such as ftse 100 stock futures have a completely different set of specifications anyway in this one example the s&p 500 futures contract has an initial margin of $ meaning that is how much it would cost you to establish that contract futures generally require delivery of 1,000 units of the underlying asset so you would take the underlying asset 's price and multiple it by 1,000 what price you use is also mentioned in the contract specification the s&p 500 index   is $ you mentioned so on you would have to delivery $ x 1000 or $ great news you only have to put up 1.2 in principal to control a 1.5 million dollar asset although if even that amount is too great you can look at the e mini s&p futures which require about 1/10th the capital and delivery this answer required that a lot of different subjects be mentioned so feel free to ask a new question about the more specific topics

on credit cards i am assuming you have a visa or master card the rbi does not decide the rate the rate is decided by visa or master the standard sheet rate for the day is used additionally sbi would mark it up by few fx mark up spread this is shown as mark up fee the rate of usd vs inr changes frequently on large value say 1 million trades even a off makes a huge difference and hence the rate is constantly changing going up or down the rates offered to individuals are constant through out the day they change from day to day and can go up for down recently in the past 6 months if you read the papers rupee has been going down and is at historic low on a give day there are 2 rates bank buy rate ie the rate at which bank will buy usd from you say 61 so it will buy 100 usd and give you rupees bank sell rate ie the rate at which bank will sell usd to you say 62 so if you want 100 usd you need to give bank the difference between this is the profit to bank
