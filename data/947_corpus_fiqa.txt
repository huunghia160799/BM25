rather than using the human development index or ease of doing business if you primary purpose is for investments you need to consider the country rating provided by various agencies like   these would tell as to how good the country is for investment in general just to highlight a difference china may not fare very high in human development index however right now from investment point of view its a pretty good market once you have decided the countries you can either invest in funds in these countries or if legally permitted invest directly into the leading stock index in such countries if your intention is to start a business in these countries then you need to look at some other indexes

if you have self control and a good handle on your finances which it sounds like i suggest the following note 3 is important if you 're not able to pay it off each month do n't do this because it will cost you a lot in interest make sure to check how interest is calculated in case you do n't pay it off in full or miss the due date for a month if you can do this you 'll earn some good benefits from the card using money that you 're going to spend anyway as well as build your credit profile regarding annual fees

it was not 100 clear if you have held all of these stocks for over a year   therefore depending on your income tax bracket it might make sense to hold on to the stock until you have held the individual stock for a year to only be taxed at long term capital gains rates   also you need to take into account the net investment income if your current modified adjusted income is above the current threshold   beyond these i would think that you would want to apply the same methodology that caused you to buy these in the first place as it seems to be working well for you 2 3 no   you trigger a taxable event and therefore have to pay capital gains tax on any gains   if you have a loss in the stock and repurchase the stock within 30 days you do n't get to recognize the loss and have to add the loss to your basis in the stock wash sales rules

a few reasons   first it 's hard to buy a stock that has never gone up and is n't necessarily wise to do so   even if you just wait for a stock go down what if you wait and it goes up two dollars then drops 10 cents   has it gone up or down   when should you buy it in general your idea is correct the higher the price the less you should want the stock   but in some sense the past price is irrelevant you ca n't buy it at the past price   you should buy it now if it 's the best option now   and that is based on your assessment of whether it 's future prospects are worth the current price and in fact enough worth enough to make buying the stock the best economic decision you can currently make finally the price may have gone up for a reason   the company may have done something or some information about the company may have become known that affects it 's future prospects   that might make it a better deal perhaps even better than it was before the price increase

actually banks are n't required to and do n't report on because they already report $ cash transactions to fincen as a currency transaction report ctr which is similar see the first item under exceptions in the second column of page 3 of the actual form yes is for businesses that 's why the form title is received in a trade or business   you did not receive the money as part of a trade or business and it 's not taxable income to you so you are n't required to report receiving it your are unclear but assuming you have n't deposited yet when you do the bank will confirm your identity and file their ctr it is extremely unlikely the government will investigate you for a single transaction close to $ 10k they 're after whales and killer sharks not but if they do when they do you simply explain where the money came from the irs abuses were with respect to people mostly small businesses that made numerous cash deposits slightly under $ 10k which can be but in the abuse cases actually was not an attempt to avoid reporting which is called structuring as long as you cooperate with the bank 's required reporting and do n't avoid it you are fine

if you are just starting out learning to code then really just pick a language you 'll learn some principles that can be transfered to other languages and with experience that becomes easier every time    python is easy great for beginners since it is free has a great community and support online and is pretty well suited for data analysis there are several books for using python for finance google that phrase python is also quite popular for web development which might be another way to learn to code it will require learning html and sql databases besides python but even so might be more accessible rather than jumping into data analysis while learning how to code depends on the person though

i know this may be difficult for you and like so many other people pointed out here you either only read what you want or do not comprehend what you read    i was specifically talking about ms the entire time never said anything about the bakery you are referencing so once again you are making a moot point with your protected class information i was talking about how the entire state was burned in reddit when some bigoted business owners decided to not do business with people about 8 months ago   again just because you think something should be some way does n't mean it is wish and hope all you want to but until the law says they are protected they are not so again what paypal did is not different than what the businesses in ms did but your type of people had the opposite reaction then than you do now and i was merely trying to point it out like almost everyone else you are arguing with in this thread has tried to but fell on deaf ears they are the same but they do not match your opinion so you put up you blinders and shove your fingers in your ears while screaming like a child at anyone trying to point out a fallacy in your logic    also what does my politics have to do with this i hate to burst your bubble but i 'm not libertarian regardless it does not matter you bring up politics as if it would effect me by you calling me libertarian why just because my opinion is different you automatically call me out as insert political party here that does not agree with you to try and invalidate anything i 'm saying    well i 'm done it is pointless to try and tell you anything that differs from your opinion i grow tired of telling you the same thing over and over again especially when you apparently do not read replies or skip over any part that you disagree with good luck with your line of thinking hopefully one day someone like paypal does not block your business or a business you do business with because it differs from their opinion your opinion now aligns with theirs but what happens next time it does n't and they have the same kind of power let them do it once next time you well not have a choice   do n't worry about replying i 'm no longer interested in hearing your opinion as i have now made up my mind that you are small minded and lack basic thought required to see past your immediate fields of view    they are burning someone else now eventually they well burn you since you are so happy to let them do it too someone else do n't make a stand now they will not let you make a stand later

when you buy a house the real estate agent or title company normally draws up a big sheet with all the costs and payments involved there are typically two columns one for amounts paid to or paid by the seller and another for amounts paid to or paid by the buyer who is responsible for what is a legal question this is pretty fixed but it 's very common for the seller to agree to pay some portion of the buyer 's closing costs in any house sale i 've ever been involved in whether as buyer or seller nobody bothers to say which costs the seller is agreeing to pay rather the seller just agrees to a number then somewhere on the sheet of costs there will be a line that says closing costs paid by seller or some such wording and then it shows a minus to the seller and a plus to the buyer or something equivalent depending on how the sheet is organized   the amount is negotiated when you make an offer you 'll say whatever numbers you are prepared to offer like i offer to pay $ 100,000 for the house seller to pay $ 3,000 of closing costs and whatever other conditions seller to repair the leak in the roof whatever it makes sense for the seller to pick up some share of the closing costs because the seller normally walks away with cash in hand while the buyer is struggling to come up with enough cash to make a down payment and pay all the closing costs i.e. the seller probably can afford to give up some cash while the buyer may be struggling to come up with cash the only costs i can think of that i 've had before closing day are a earnest money b inspection c credit check or application fee to bank earnest money is applied to the purchase price at closing so it 's pretty much a moot point the application fee is a potential deal breaker i 've never heard of a seller agreeing to pay this but i guess they could but if you ca n't get the loan you probably wo n't buy the house so the seller would be out money for nothing   everything else is normally paid on closing day they total up all the costs and all the money floating around and at the end the seller gets one check that is the net of everything and the buyer writes one check that is the net of everything and the realtor or title company deals with getting the money to the right people so there 's normally no issue of paying things as they come up you do it all at once

no there is no indication that the recent decline will have an impact on the house market in the uk the for the downward move these last few weeks are mainly due to the last two points caused the chinese government to decide to the yuan this in turn triggered an unforeseen panic attack among investors and speculators around the globe starting with the chinese that are trading on borrowed money not only on margin but also by using loans the uk house prices are not influenced by the above factors not even indirectly the most important factors for house prices are in general if you keep the above points in mind you should be able to decide whether now is the right time to buy a house in your area given that a lot of central banks incl boe are maintaining a low interest rate policy except fed soon now is a good time to take a mortgage sources used i know interest rates are determined by the boe which looks at the global picture to determine these rates but the main directive of a central bank is to maintain an inflation close to but not exactly 2 as to spur on economic growth   as such the value of a company as on the stock market is not or barely taken into account the negligible impact is the reason why i stated that the crash in the summer of 2015 does n't even have an indirect impact   also such a crash is very short lived it 's more the underlying reason for the fears that could cause issues if they drag on

credit is very important even if you are wealthy one thing you may not realize is that rich people typically have comparatively little cash on hand   if they 're smart most of their assets are not liquid they 're tied up in safe long term investments   they use credit for their day to day expenses and pay it off from the dividends on their investments which might only come in once a quarter there are also tax advantages to using credit   if a rich person wanted a new car he 'd be smarter leasing it for his business immediate write off of the lease payments on taxes versus buying it depreciation over several years plus property tax liability in some states   there are more elaborate tax but the point is that buying a car outright is the worst option in terms of tax avoidance another way the rich mis use credit is so that they do n't risk their own money on business ventures   let 's say i have $ 1,000,000 in my personal bank account and i want to buy a business that costs $ 1m.   if i am dumb i clean out my bank account and put all my money in the business   i get 100 of the profits but i also bear 100 of the risk   if i 'm smart i loan 200 k of my own money in the business and put the rest someplace safe and get a loan from a bank for the other   if the business succeeds the bank gets their money back plus interest   if it fails the business declares bankruptcy and the bank eats the 800k loss if i structured the debt right my personal loan to the failed business gets paid back first when the company is liquidated and the bank gets whatever is left over if anything   the most of my own money i can possibly lose is 200k and probably it 's closer to zero if i have a good accountant

take some of the commentary on home buying forums with a grain of salt i too have read some of the commentary on these forums such as myfico or zillow and rarely is the right advice given or proper followup done typical 401k withdrawals for home purchase would not be considered a hardship however most employer 401k plans will allow you to take a loan for 401k as long as you provide suitable documentation statement real estate contract good faith estimate or some other form of suitable documentation as described by the plan administrator   for instance i just took a 401k loan to pay for closing costs and i had to provide only the real estate contract could i not follow through with the contract sure but what if i am found out for fraud then the plan administrator would probably end up turning the distribution into a taxable distribution i would n't go to jail in this hypothetical situation i am only stealing from myself but the law states that certain loan situations are not liable for tax as long as that situation still exists in the home loan situation my employer allows for a low interest 10 year loan my employer also allows for a pre approved loan for any purpose this would be a low interest 5 year loan   there is also the option to not do a loan at all but normally that is only allowed after you have exhausted all your loan options and the government makes it intentionally harsh 30 penalty at least to discourage people from dumping their tax free haven 401k accounts that all being said many plans offer no prepayment penalty so like my employer has for us i can pay it all back in full whenever i want or make micropayments every month otherwise it comes out of my pay stub biweekly so if it were to fall through i could just put it all back like it never happened though with my plan there is a cooling off period of 7 days before i can take another loan keep in mind that if you leave your employer then the full amount becomes a taxable distribution unless you pay it back within a certain period of time after leaving the employer   whether this fits your financial situation is up to you but a loan is definitely preferred over a partial or full withdrawal since you are paying yourself back for your rightly earned retirement which is just as important

i think you are asking a few questions here why is gold chosen as money in a free market there are five characteristics of a good money gold and silver meet all five characteristics   diamonds are not easily divisible which is why they are not normally used as money   copper iron and lead are not scarce enough you would need a lot of these metals to make weekly or daily purchases   paper is also way too plentiful to be used as money by the way historically silver has been used for money more than gold how does international trade work with gold as money is this what you are asking with your hypothetical example of 10 countries each with y amount of gold typically a government will issue a currency that is backed by gold   this means you can redeem your currency for actual gold   then when an american spends 5 us dollars usd to purchase a chinese good the chinese man now owns 5   the chinese man can either redeem the 5 usd for gold or spend the 5 usd in the us   if a government issues more currency then they have gold for then the gold will start to flow from that country to other countries as the citizens of the other countries redeem the over issued currency for gold   this outflow of gold restricts governments from over issuing paper currency who creates the procedures and who them in modern worldwide economy the federal reserve imf and bank of international settlements all are involved in the current system where the us dollar see bretton woods agreement is the reserve currency used by central banks throughout the world   some think this system is coming to an end   i tend to agree

yes you can do the withdraw if you turned 55 during the year you separated from service leaving your job on or after age 55 the age 59½ distribution rule says any 401k participant may begin to withdraw money from his or her plan after reaching the age of 59½ without having to pay a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty there is an exception to that rule however which allows an employee who retires quits or is fired at age 55 to withdraw without penalty from their 401k the rule of 55 there are three key points early retirees need to know first this exception applies if you leave your job at any time during the calendar year in which you turn 55 or later according to irs publication 575 second if you still have money in the plan of a former employer and assuming you were n't at least age 55 when you left that employer you 'll have to wait until age 59½ to start taking withdrawals without penalty better yet get any old 401k 's rolled into your current 401k before you retire from your current job so that you will have access to these funds penalty free third this exception only applies to funds withdrawn from a 401k iras operate until different rules so if you retire and roll money into an ira from your 401k before age 59½ you will lose this exception on those dollars

first off i 'm very sorry for your loss   depending on when the money comes in i would park it and give it some time   after that one of the best investments is paying off debt   right now your net worth is less than 30 k and that is really not even accessible until retirement   if the money is there to pay off the house i would do that   if there is n't enough to pay off the house then i would pay off the automobile and put all or a sizable portion of the remainder into the house   now you have very little risk in your life and most likely much more monthly income to invest in 401 k iras college funds or any other investment life insurance is mostly to replace your income if there are people counting on that income spouse kids etc   normally this would be invested to hopefully replace that income with the growth of the money   in your case it does n't sound like you were relying on your father 's income so this can go to clean up current debt finally depending on your relationship what kind of person your father was and how he was with financials what do you think he would want you to do with it

for starting with zero knowledge you certainly did a great job on research as you hit on most of the important points with your question   it seems like you have already saved up around six months of expenses in savings so it is a great time to look into investing the hardest part of your question is actually one of the most important details   investing in a way that minimizes your taxes is generally more important in the end than what assets you actually invest in as long as you invest even semi reasonably   the problem is that the interaction between your home country 's tax system and the u.s. tax system can be complex   it 's probably likely still worth maxing out your 401(k ira sep 529 accounts if you qualify to avoid taxes but like this question from an indian investor it may be worth seeing an investment professional about this   if you do see a fee based professional preferably one familiar with your country    if tax advantaged accounts are not a good deal for you or if you max them out a discount broker is probably a good second option for someone willing to do a bit of research like you with this money investing in broadly diversified low fee index mutual funds or exchange traded funds is generally recommended   among other benefits diversified funds make sure that if any particular company fails you do n't feel too much pain   the advantages of low fees are fairly obvious and one very good reason why so many people recommend vanguard on this site   a common mix for someone your age is mostly stocks local and international and some bonds   though with how you talk about risk you may prefer more bonds some people recommend this up a bit with a small amount of real estate reits sometimes even other assets   the right portfolio of the above can change a lot given the person   the above mentioned adviser and/or more research can help here if in the future you start to believe you will go back to your home country soon that may throw much of this advice out the window and you should definitely reevaluate then   also if you are interested in the math stats behind the above advice a random walk down wall street is a light read and a good place to start   investing makes for a very interesting and reasonably profitable math stats problem

past results are not a predictor of future results there is no explicit upper bound on a market and even if individual companies values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term plus there 's been some   shift from managing companies for dividends to managing stocks for growth which will tend to increase the upward push trying to time the market to guess when it 's going to move in any particular direction is usually closer to gambling than investing the simplest answer remains a combination of buy and hold and dollar cost averaging buy at a constant number of dollars per month or whatever frequency you prefer and you will automatically buy more when the stock fund is lower less when it is higher that takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end personally i add a bit of contrarian buying to that i increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed since i had money i would n't need any time soon buy and hold and i was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that i was n't at significant risk of losing the investment that 's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an aggressive investor even though i 'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money my goal is to have the money work for me not vice versa

in 2001 argentina defaulted on it 's debt and started negotiating a haircut with it 's debtors as a result a lot of the debtors sold the bonds they had a fire sale prices thinking better get some back than nothing   one of the guys that bought those cheap bonds was paul singer aka mr. vulture hedge fund i 'll speculate here saying that mr. singer saw that the bond conditions gave him a way to force argentina to pay the full value of the bonds notwithstanding it 's default or negotiated haircut argentina did negotiate a haircut with about 97 of it 's bond holders this meant that although they would lose out on some of the money they would still get some back and argentina could work its way back to its feet eventually    mr. singer and friends were the 3 that did not accept the haircut and took the country to court to get 100 of the bond value back   now the plot i do n't understand if mr. singer knew this or not but the bonds also had a condition that said that no bond holder would be worst off than the highest bond deal argentina offered anyone which basically means if they pay mr. singer 100 they have to pay everybody else 100 now it was well established that argentina could not pay 100 and is not able to pay 100 of the debt hence the 2001 default    meanwhile argentina was paying out the hair cut bonds but holding out on mr. singer and friends as they still did n't agree to pay 100 the courts ruled that they could not do this and had to pay everybody since argentina can not pay everybody 100 it is defaulting on the debt

the first thing is to look at the monthly cost of the loan the one from the company is interest free while it is unlikely that a bank will have a zero percent loan you will also have to look at what the seller will offer   the next thing to look at is the term of the loan when comparing two loans with the same interest rate the shorter term loan will cost more per month many times when an auto dealer offers a zero percent loan they also   have a very short term 12 24 months many people ca n't afford the monthly payments with that short a term   you said you could afford to save the other $ 2000 in about six months that means you could set aside $ a month to do it in six months if the loan from the employer has a term longer than 6 months you should be able to afford the loan keep in mind that the employer will probably be taking the money right out of your paychecks   you do have to look at the conditions attached to the loan what does accepting the loan do to your employment situation if you leave early do they want you to pay it back in 30 days or will they take the rest from the final paycheck or do you have longer   you do have to look at the term of the loan and see if you can pay it off early if they require a 12 month term can you end it earlier or change the monthly payment to end it early the reason why you care about the term is that if the term is 24 months then after a year you still owe them $ 1000 which if you have to pay back immediately if you quit it may make it hard for you to leave the company a minor note they probably are not reporting it to the credit reporting agencies therefore it wo nt help your credit score this is probably not a big issue since you are considering going without a loan

you 're making $ 100k together per year you 're not in the hole you 're in the top 25 of all households and the top 10 of non family households as yours would be   to be blunt you 're not in the rely on assistance area you 're in the save up for your downpayment sector my suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $ a month for now   $ 100k gross income means you have about $ 8k net income per month $ 2k for rent and other necessities means you have $ 6k per month that you can potentially save   even half of that $ 3k per month means you have $ saved by the end of this year and $ on an annual basis as far as marriage or domestic partnership i would n't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home   it might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property perhaps but not solely for the financial aspect and as far as how much home is realistic   $ 250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment   try to get to the 20 25 range   if you 're already halfway there another year of renting wo n't kill you and it will mean no pmi and much better rates    also consider a 15 year mortgage we 're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $ 250k range house quite nicely   it does n't add all that much to your monthly payment amount compared to what you 'd expect particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which wo n't increase based on the length of the mortgage now that we have actual numbers from the op so without cutting anything you have $ 2k yourself you can be saving   this assumes your rent number of $ is your portion of rent and not the 100 amount   that 's $ per year just by yourself   on top of that you 've got another $ 40k or so coming from your partner at least some of which should be available as well if he she is going to be co owning   but if not at least you have about $ 2000 a month you can be saving   you could also downsize the car cut cable tv downsize the phone and have another $ 500 or so available but it does n't really look like you need to do that given how much you have available now i 'd look at what you 're doing with that per month right now and see how you can free most of it up   you have n't mentioned a few things like utilities not sure if that 's just or if your partner is paying them so perhaps not all of it is available   but even $ 1000 a month is $ 12000 to add to the $ 20000 you have now which makes a big dent in that down payment

with forex trading physical currency is not involved you 're playing with the live exchange rates and it is not designed for purchasing selling physical currency most forex trading is based on leveraging thus you 're not only buying money that you 're not going to physically receive you 're also paying with money that you do not physically have the investment is in fact a speculation and is akin to gambling which if i remember correctly is strictly forbidden under the islam rules that said the positions you have are yours and technically you can demand the physical currency to be delivered to you no broker will allow online trading on these conditions though similarly to the stocks almost no broker allows using physical certificates for stocks trading anymore

rent the property is that a possible solution since selling the house is not an option and living in it is n't either then perhaps renting it is the way to go since no explanation for the sister 's motives is given i 'd speculate it is a mixture of emotional and financial concerns maybe mostly emotional i imagine letting go of the one physical thing that has memories of you and your parents attached to it is very difficult i do n't think getting a lawyer or doing what 's convenient for only your boyfriend is the way to go but that 's my own personal opinion clearly he only has one close family member left alive creating permanent wounds in that relationship will cost more along the way and quite frankly if the house is owned 50 50 do n't you need both owners to sign the deed to sell the house anyways if renting is not an option then maybe refinancing the mortgage to lower payments or airbnb it only half the time or rent it out for events to help with payments or ask the sister for a little money not for half the mortgage but at least a few hundred dollars to maintain the house and heat if she is indeed concerned with the property then maintaining it to prevent serious is in her interests no matter her income

the thing about the glide path is that the closer you 're to the retirement age the less risk you should be taking with your investments all investments carry risk but if you invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 20 and lose all your retirement money it will not have the same effect on your retirement as if you 'd invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 65 and then lose all your retirement money static allocation throughout your life without changing the risk factor will lead you to a very conservative investment path which would mean you 're not likely to lose your investments but you 're not likely to gain much either the point of the glide path is to allow you taking more risks early with more chances of higher gains but to limit your risks down the road also limiting your potential gains that is why it is always suggested to start your retirement funds early in your life to make sure you have enough time to invest in potentially high return stocks with high risk but when you get close to your retirement age it is advised to do exactly the opposite the date targeted funds do that for you but you can do it on your own as well as to the academic research you do n't need to go that far just look at the graphs to see that over long period investments in stocks give much better return than conservative bonds and treasuries especially when averaging the investments as it usually is with the retirement funds but over a given short period investments in stocks are much more likely to significantly lose in value

you are entirely correct that it is an assumption so i will not argue the point any further other than to say that i do n't think it 's a very large stretch of the imagination to say that a more robust bitcoin economy and a larger user base would smooth it out the volatility it seems pretty reasonable to me that the instability in prices ca n't be accounted for from the technology that runs bitcoin and yet it is obvious that the current bitcoin economy is borderline abysmal it 's the things bitcoin allows you to do outside of financial institutions that give it a over typical government backed fiat currencies when we utilize this advantage real people will use the technology and a genuine economy could flourish    as a caveat to this i 'm not 100 convinced that bitcoins are the answer to me bitcoins are one particular brand of free as in speech decentralized crypto currencies when i speak of bitcoins i 'm promoting the idea it represents more than this particular implementation although i do believe the exact software you can download and run at this moment have the potential for tremendously more use than they 're currently being used for

this question is really a variation of rent vs buy   try looking at it this way if you bought it 50/50 and rented it out what would you both get now moved in you are effectively collecting that rent but half is your own money half is from the partner   is the half you are getting the from the partner equal to 1/4 of the mortgage this sounds convoluted but once you spell all the numbers out it would be clear   without the deal as you present it you 'd be paying the partner to live in his half

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

generally a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per share dividends paid by the company plus a fraction of the company 's assets net value in the event of liquidation   if one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts as time goes by the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid it will cease to contribute to the stock 's value because people are not they generally do n't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make   a sane price for a stock however may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments   if unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward the price of the stock should increase   if events cause estimates to be revised downward the price should fall in a sane marketplace if the price of a stock is below people 's estimates of its payouts current cash value people should buy the stock and push the price upward   if it is above people 's estimates they should sell the stock and push the price downward   note that in a sane marketplace rising prices are a red flag indicator for people to stop buying   unfortunately sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead   when that happens prices may soar through the roof but it 's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts   if that value is $ 10/share someone who buys a share for $ 50 basically gives the seller $ 40 that he was not entitled to and which the buyer will never get back   the buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him $ 60 for the share but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one $ 50 that he was n't entitled to either   if the price falls back to $ 10 calling that fall a market correction would n't be a but rather state a fact the share was worth $ 10 before people sold it for crazy prices and still worth $ 10 afterward   it was the market price that was in error the important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in   it 's not necessary to look only at present price earnings ratios since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year   what 's important however is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost

yes becoming a millionaire is a reasonable goal   saving 15 of your income starting at age 25 and investing in the stock market will likely get you there the cagr compound annual growth rate of the s&p 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11 that 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes you may get more or less than that number in the future but let 's guess that you 'll average 9 let 's say that you begin with nothing invested and you start investing $ 100 per week at age 25 if your annual income is $ 35,000 that is about 15 of your income   you decide to invest your money in an s&p 500 index mutual fund 35 years from now when you are 60 years old you would be a millionaire $ 1.2 million actually you may earn less than the assumed 9 depending on how the stock market does   however if you stick with your 15 investment amount throughout your whole career you 'll most likely end up with more because your income will probably increase during your career   and you will probably be working past age 60 giving your investments time to earn even more

my understanding i 've never filed one myself is that the 1040es is intended to allow you to file quarterly and report unpredictable income and to pay estimated taxes on that income    i was in the same sort of boat for 2016 i had a big unexpected income source in 2015 and this took away my safe harbor for 2016   i adjusted my w-2 to zero exemptions eventually and will be getting a refund of about 1 of our income so lets say you make 10000 in in march and another 15000 in in april   file a quarterly 1040-es between march 31 and april 15   report the income and pay some tax   you should be able to calculate the tax for 10k pretty easily   just assume that it comes off the top and does n't add at all to your deductions   then for april do the same by june 15 just like your w-2 is used to estimate how much your employer should withhold the 1040es is designed to estimate how much extra you need to pay to the irs to avoid penalties   it 'll all get resolved after you file your final 1040 for the 2017 calendar year

i agree with all the people against working for free but i 'll also have a go at answering the question when do i see money related to that 5 is it only when they get    bought or is there some sort of quarterly payout of profits it 's up to the shareholders of the company whether and when it pays dividends a new startup will typically have a small number of people perhaps 1 3 who between them control any shareholder vote the and an investor if they 're offering you 5 chances are they 've made sure your vote will not matter but some companies an equity partnership springs to mind might be structured such that control is genuinely distributed you would want to check what the particular situation is in this company assuming the founders main investors have control those people or that person will decide whether to pay dividends so you can ask them their plans to realise money from the company it is very rare for startups to pay any dividends this is firstly because they 're rarely profitable but even when they are profitable the whole point of a startup is to grow so there are plenty of things to spend cash on other than payouts to shareholders paying anything out to shareholders is the opposite of receiving investment so unless you 're in the very unusual position of a startup that will quickly make so much money that it does n't need investment and is planning to pay out to shareholders rather than spend on growth then no it will not pay out one way for a shareholder to exit is to be bought out by other shareholders for example if they want to get rid of you then they might make you an offer for your 5 this can be any amount they think you 'll take given the situation at the time if you do n't take it there may be things they can do in future to reduce its value to you see below if you do take it then your 5 would pay you once when you leave if the company succeeds commonly it will be wholly or partly sold either privately or by ipo at this point if it 's wholly sold then the soon to be ex shareholders at the time will receive the proceeds of the sale if it 's partly sold then as with an investment round it 's up for negotiation what happens for example i believe the cash from an ipo of x% of the company could be taken into the company leaving the shareholders with no immediate direct payout but of shares in their names that they 're more or less free to sell or retain and receive future dividends alternatively if the company settles down as a small private business that 's no longer in startup mode it might start paying out without a sale if the company fails as most startups do it will never pay anything it 's very important to remember that it 's the shareholders at the time who receive money in proportion to their holding or as defined by the company articles if there are different classes of share just because you have 5 now does n't mean you 'll have 5 by that time because any new investment into the company in the mean time will dilute your shareholding it works like this note that i 've assumed for simplicity that the new investment comes in at equal value to the old investment this is n't necessarily the case it can be more or less according to the terms of the new investment voted for by the shareholders so the first line really is nominal value not necessarily the actual cash the founders put in therefore you should not think of your 5 as 5 of what you imagine a company like yours might eventually exit for at best think of it as 5 of what a company like yours might exit for if it receives no further investment whatsoever ah but wo n't the founders also have their holdings diluted and lose control of the company so they would n't do that well not necessarily look carefully at whether you 're being offered the same class of shares as the founders if not consider whether they can dilute your shares without diluting their own look also at whether a new investor could use the founders executive positions to give them new equity in the same way they gave you old equity without giving you any new equity look at whether the founders will themselves participate in future investment rounds using of cash that they own from other ventures when you ca n't afford to keep up look at whether new investors will receive a priority class of share that 's guaranteed at exit to pay out a certain multiple of the money invested before the older inferior classes of shares receive anything vcs like to do this at least in the uk look at any other tricks they can legally pull even if the founders are n't inclined to be tricky they may eventually be forced to consider pulling them by a future new investor and when i say look i mean get your lawyer to look if your shareholding survives until exit then it will pay out at exit but repeated and investors with priority classes of shares could mean that your holding does n't survive to exit even if the company does your 5 could turn into a nominal holding that has n't really survived that entitles you to 0.5 of any sale value over $ 100 million then if the company sells for $ 50 million you get $ 0 while other investors are getting a good return all of this is why you should not work for equity unless you can afford to work for free and even then you need to lawyer up now and during any future investment so your lawyer can explain to you what your investment actually is which almost certainly is different from what it looks like at a casual uninformed glance

by mentioning gld i presume therefore you are referring to the gold exchange traded fund that is intended to mirror the price of gold without you having to personally hold bullion or even gold certificates while how much is a distinctly personal choice there are seemingly at least three camps of people in the investment world first would be traditional bond fixed income and equity people   gold would play no direct role in their portfolio other than perhaps holding gold company shares in some other vehicle but they would not hold much gold directly secondly at the mid range would be someone like yourself that believes that is in and of itself a worthy investment and makes it a non trivial but not overriding part of their portfolio   your 5 10 range seems to fit in well here lastly and to my taste over the top are the gold gold gold investors that seem to believe it is the panacea for all market woes   i always suspect that investment gurus that are pushing this however have large positions that they are trying to run up so they can unload given all this i am not aware of any general rule about gold but anything less than 10 would seem like at least a not over concentration in the one area   once any one holding gets much beyond that you should really examine why you believe that it should represent such a large part of your holdings good luck

i would n't say you should have any particular limit but it ca n't hurt to have a higher limit i 'd always accept the increase when offered and feel free to request it sometimes just make sure you find out if it will be a hard or soft inquiry and pass on the hard inquires from my own experience there does n't seem to be any or reason to the increases i believe each bank acts differently based on the customer 's credit income and even the bank 's personal quotas or goals for that period here is some anecdotal evidence of this i got my first credit card when i was 18 years old and a freshman in college it had a limit of $ 500 at the time i never asked for a credit line increase but always accepted when offered one and sometimes they did n't even ask and in the last 20 years it worked it 's way up to $ 25k. another card with the same bank went from $ 5 k to $ 15 k in about 10 years about 6 years ago i added two cards one with a $ 5 k limit and one with a $ 3 k limit i did n't ask for increases on those either and today the 5 k is up to $ 22 k and the 3 k is still at $   an even larger disparity exists on the business side years ago i had two business credit cards with different banks at one point in time both were maxed out for about 6 months and only minimums were being paid bank 1 started lowering my credit limit as i started to pay off the card eventually prompting me to cancel the card when it was paid in full at the same time bank 2 kept raising my limit to give me more breathing room in case i needed it obviously bank 1 did n't want my business and bank 2 did less than a year later both cards were paid off in full and you can guess which bank i chose to do all of my business with after that

a section contract is any non equity options include debt options commodity futures options currency options and broad based stock index options a broad based stock index is based upon the value of a group of diversified stocks or securities such as the standard and poor 's 500 index 60 of the capital gain or loss from section contracts is deemed to be long term capital gain or loss and 40 is deemed to be short term capital gain or loss what this means is a more favorable tax treatment of 60 of your gains it 's a really rule 60 designation so broad etc but section contracts get preferential tax treatment and that 's what buffett 's talking about

st. john 's church richmond virginia march 23   mr president no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house but different men often see the same subject in different lights and therefore i hope it will not be thought to those gentlemen if entertaining as i do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs i shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve this is no time for ceremony the question before the house is one of awful moment to this country for my own part i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to god and our country should i keep back my opinions at such a time through fear of giving offence i should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of toward the of heaven which i above all kings   mr. president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that till she us into is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it   i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of experience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past and judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received trust it not sir it will prove a to your feet suffer not yourselves to be with a kiss ask yourselves how this reception of our petition with these war like preparations which cover our waters and our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and the last arguments to which kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to and humble what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i you sir deceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have we have we have we have ourselves before the and have its to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our have been our have produced additional violence and insult our have been disregarded and we have been with contempt from the foot of the in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be if we mean to preserve those privileges for which we have been so long we mean not to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us   they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so an but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally and when a british guard shall be in every house shall we gather strength by and inaction shall we acquire the means of resistance by lying on our backs and hugging the phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who over the of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their may be heard on the plains of boston the war is let it come i repeat it sir let it come   it is in vain sir to the matter gentlemen may cry peace there is no peace the war is actually begun the next that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of arms our are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death   this speech is the best response i can give

if you have no net income or loss you can usually get away without filing a tax return   in illinois the standard is filing requirements    you must file form if you are a corporation that    has net income or loss as defined under the or    is qualified to do business in the state of illinois and is required to file a federal income tax return regardless of net income or loss    just keep your filing fee and any business licenses up to date paying those fees personally and not out of business money that would make for a net loss and trigger needing a tax return   frankly with how easy it is to register a new corp especially an llc which has many simplicity advantages from an s corp in certain cases you might still be better off shutting it down until that time

i do n't even know where to begin you 're truly all over the place the number of upvotes on your post has absolutely zero relevance to the fact that you believe trump has caused this minuscule reduction in the deficit you literally said it yourself you posted an article and stated let 's discuss and then when it was discussed your argument was completely refuted in a heartbeat why did n't you respond to 's post he laid out a rational argument to refute your opinion however you unfortunately did n't have the facts or understanding on the subject to back your opinion so instead you stayed away from that comment argument because it did n't reflect your biased way of thinking this is the basis of which the shrinking pro trump base now stand they project their opinions then cherry pick the feedback that helps them feel good about their opinions while refusing to respond to any arguments that have factual information amp merit   i 'm going to give you some advise is n't a good place for you to learn about the basics of economics and i know you do not know the bare basics because anyone with any clue about how modern economics works knows that a president can not enact true economic growth or can significantly reduce a national budget deficit in 8 months while not introducing amp passing one piece of meaningful legislature or enacting any piece of their economic agenda which both sides of the aisle are fully aware amp accept that trump has n't been able to accomplish yet   now this is going to put you in a tough spot the s&amp;p under obama was up 30 after his first 8 months in office by your rational obama grew the overall wealth of the top 500 companies in the u.s. by 30 before he was able to enact any legislature but no obama could n't have done that because he only introduced destructive economic legislature from the get go therefore the president must have no control over economic success or failure within their first year of the presidency before they can make use of their economic agenda however that would go against your entire argument you set forward in this post puts you in a bit of a    sorry for the long response it 's just tough seeing someone make repeated simple basic economic mistakes in the subreddit feel free to pm me if you 're looking for some good books to get you started

yes there is debtor 's prison in the u.s.   but you do n't get sentenced because of the debt itself but because you are not paying as much as a judge deems reasonable tens of thousands of mostly men are in jail because they are not able to pay an amount set by the court here is a balanced article that explains the situation note that the court does not need to prove your guilt you also can end up in jail even if you have absolutely no ability to pay in the georgia class action case the plaintiffs were jailed in civil    contempt of court proceedings in which they did not have lawyers they    included three veterans one who had paid $ 75,000 in child support    but fell behind when he lost his civilian job because of    combat related stress and family deaths a second who was mentally ill    and had a letter from a veterans affairs doctor saying he was unable    to work and a third who was despite having paid $    toward his debt by working odd jobs note that in these court proceedings you do not have the right to a lawyer and you are not presumed innocent

sounds to me like you 're describing just how it should work   ask is at 30 bid is at 20 you offer a new bid at 25   either depending on liquidity one or the other may be more likely this article on the subject describes what you 're seeing and recommends the strategy you 're describing precisely instead of a market order take advantage of the fact that the options world truly is a marketplace one where you can possibly get a better price just by asking how does that work if you use a limit order instead of a market order when opening a position you can tell your broker how much you are willing to pay to enter a trade for example if you enter a limit price of $ 1.15 you can see whether the market maker will bite you will be surprised at how many times you will get your price i.e. $ 1.15 instead of the ask price of $ 1.30 if your order at $ 1.15 is not filled after a few minutes you can modify your order and pay the ask price by entering a market order or limit order at the ask price that is you can tell your broker to pay no more than $ 1.30

hopefully before you invested in this stock you evaluated the company   you looked at the financial information about the company and where the company was headed and evaluated whether the stock was undervalued or overvalued   hopefully you determined that the stock was undervalued at the time you bought it the thing to do now is to reevaluate the stock   do you think the stock is overvalued or undervalued right now   if you did n't own it would you buy it today   instead of looking at the past performance of the stock you want to try to determine which direction the stock will go from today   if you would n't buy it today at it 's current price then you should sell if you have no idea how to do this evaluation neither do i.   for me with the investing knowledge i have right now investing in an individual stock would be way too risky   if you do n't know how to evaluate a stock and determine if it is a good buy or not then you should stay away from individual stocks and instead invest in stock mutual funds which lower the risk by diversifying over lots of stocks

there are few cases where trades were reverted because of a technical issues for example when bats did its ipo its price went down to a few penny due to a computer glitch because of that the regulators allowed the trades to be reversed as if nothing happened i think that some trades during the flash crash of the 6 may 2010 were reversed too however if the act is clearly fraudulent they can try to sue the responsible if a tribunal were to condemn him to reimburse them and that he has enough money to pay for it they could get their money back but think of madoff the people that invested with madoff did n't have their investment reversed as madoff did n't have the money to pay them back the goes with most of criminal crooks and even traders finally before thinking of reverting anything there are laws about financial firms to make them implements proper checks to avoid that kind of fraudulent activities as they are responsible for most of the operational risk especially when it could impact both the firm and their clients and if the firm does n't comply with those laws they are unlikely to get the tribunal on their side if a problem arise

it depends   if you ’re a lowly bankrupting is bad because you deprive the hard working bourgeois who have worked very hard to give you some debt and by not repaying your debt to them you are punishing their business success and depriving them of their rightfully owned interest and principal and this is not moral at all as this is highly frowned upon by the lord jesus christ himself   however if you ’re a big bankrupcy is good because it enables you to restructure your financial environment to insure a better efficiency in maximizing the debt to equity ratio of your stakeholders without tying them up with excessive liability that would be detrimental to their cash flow

there is economic value added to the marketplace by having many investors trading stocks the stock market itself can be thought of as a tool which provides additional liquidity to the marketplace liquidity is the ease with which you can convert your assets into cash for example how quickly could you sell your car if you needed money to pay a medical bill without a stock market funds would be very illiquid an investor would likely need to post advertisements to have other people consider buying his her shares until the match between a buyer and seller is found the person with the shares ca n't use the cash they need on the other side of the transaction are people who have an appetite for risk this means that for various reasons they are willing to take on more risk than you if it pays off on average they are young and have many years of salary earnings in front of them or they are rich can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average consider this like a transaction between your insurance broker you do n't want to pay for a new car if you get in an accident and you 're willing to pay total annual premiums that on average will cost more than that same car over time you do n't want the risk but the insurance company does that 's how they make money so by participating in any marketplace you are providing value in the form of liquidity and by allowing the market to allocate risk to those willing to take it on

this i 'd ask around a bit to find out if more people miss the bowling alley see if there is interest for a also at the very least you should talk to the current owners about how it is going what 's happening etc to put some out without expressing direct interest maybe they have racked up a hefty debt who knows scope it out a bit   be wary of looking at it from a sentimental point of view you had a great time there you 're not guaranteed to have that again even with you running it running it and visiting it are way different   you will probably have to do a lot of marketing publicity stuff for it so plan accordingly and what said you probably need capital especially if the business has been stagnant if they serve food the kitchen may not be up to standards anymore etc   if after that you still want to do it and have a plan then definitely opt for buying them out directly or over time you probably do not want the previous owners emotional getting in the way cue gordon ramsay 's restaurant that said they may just like what you want to do and support you all the way who knows   good luck

if i have a asset a with expected return of 100 and by standard deviation 1 and asset b with expected return of 1 and risk 100 would it be rational to put asset b into the portfolio in the capital asset pricing model capm investors are rational and have access to perfect information asset a sounds like an excellent investment   b like a lousy one b is probably very far from the efficient frontier investors know this so a 's market capitalization will be high b 's low according to the capm you should then do the same rational thing everyone else is doing which is to buy a lot of a and very little of b each in proportion to its market capitalization of course the capm is just a model and like any model it is only as good as its assumptions however i think this particular application of the model gives a pretty reasonable common sense answer to the question

these sort of issues in structuring your personal finances relative to expenses can get complicated quickly as your example demonstrates   i would recommend a solution that reduces duplication as much as and depending on what information you 're interested in tracking you could set it up in very different ways one solution would be to create virtual sub accounts of your assets and to record the source of money rather than the destination   thus when you do an expense report you can limit on the his or hers asset accounts and see only the expenses which pertain to those accounts likewise for liabilities credit cards if on the other hand you 're more interested in a running sum of rather than create me and spouse accounts at every leaf of the expense tree it would make much more sense to create top level accounts for expenses his etc and expenses hers etc   using this model you could create only the sub expense accounts that apply for each of your spending with matching account structures for common accounts

some historical and mathematical insights as a complement to existing answers   history i found it astonishing that already in ancient roman they investigated the issue of perpetuity of almost writes in de re 3 3 in century ad about a perpetuity of principal under 6 p.a resulting in 1950 annual payment and   if   the     would   enter   this   amount   as   a   debt   against his just as a does with a debtor    so that the owner may realize the aforementioned six per cent interest on that total as a perpetual annuity   he   should   take   in   1950 every   year    by   this   reckoning   the return on seven even according to the opinion of exceeds the interest on math if we fix a scholarship at a year then it 's clear that it could be paid out infinitely if we could achieve 3.33 p.a on it   on the other side with 0 we 'll spend out the endowment in 30 years thus having the interest rate between 0 and 3.33 p.a we could vary the life of endowment between 30 years and infinity just a few numbers in between under 1 it would be years under 2 years under 3 years however 1000 $ in 78 years could be less than 10 $ today conclusion to keep it perpetual either the fund 's yield must be at the level of scholarship or re adjust the amount of scholarship depending on fund achievement or redefine the notion of perpetuity like 50 years is approximately infinite for our purpose

as the owner of the s corp it is far easier for you to move money in out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company loans require interest payments 1099-int forms and have tax consequences whereas the distributions do n't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed if you were paid interest disregard this answer i do n't know if or how you could re categorize the loan once there 's a 1099-int involved if no interest was ever paid you just need to account for it properly if the company did n't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-int form i.e. you wrote a check to the company no promissory note no tax forms no payments no interest etc then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution you can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the irs in quickbooks create the following equity accounts one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions when putting money into the company deposit into your corporate bank account and use the capital contribution equity account when taking money out of the company write yourself a check and use the distributions account at the end of every tax year you can close out your contributions and distributions to retained earnings by making a general journal entry for example debit retained earnings and credit distributions on dec 31 every year to zero out the distributions account for contributions do the reverse and credit retained earnings there are other ways of recording these transactions for example i think some people just use a member capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions and qb might warn you about posting journal entries to the special retained earnings account at the end of the year in any case this is how my cpa set up my books and it 's been working well enough for many years still never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your cpa be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary you ca n't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits that 's a big red flag that can trigger an audit if you 're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company that should be fine

the big question is whether you will be flexible about when you 'll get that house the overall best investment in terms of yielding a good risk return ratio and requiring little effort is a broad index fund mutual or etf especially if you 're contributing continuously and thereby take advantage of cost averaging but the downside is that you have some volatility during an economic downturn your investment may be worth only half of what it 's worth when the economy is booming and of course it 's very bad to have that happening just when you want to get your house then again chances are that house prices will also go down in such times if you want to avoid ever having to see the value of your investment go down then you 're pretty much stuck with things like your high interest savings account which sounds like a very good fit for your requirements

wire transfers normally run through either the fedwire system or the clearing house interbank payments system chips the process generally works like this you approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money you give the bank a certain code either an international bank account number or one of several other standards which informs the bank where to send the money   the bank sends a message through a system like fedwire to the receiving bank along with settlement instructions   this is where the process can get a bit tricky for the wire transfer to work the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver if the sending bank sends the money to a third party bank the transaction is settled between them and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third party bank this last transaction may be a wire transfer ach transfer etc   the federal reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the federal reserve this allows them to use the fed as the third party bank referred to above interestingly enough this is one of the significant ways in which the fed makes a profit because it along with every other bank and routing agent in the process collects a miniscule fee on this process   you 'll often find sources that state that fedwire is only for transferring large transactions while this is technically correct it 's important to understand that financial institutions do n't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately although the orders are put in immediately the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day and even then they normally only settle the difference so if chase owes bank of america $ 1 m and bank of america owes chase $ 750 k they do n't send these as two transactions chase simply credits bac $ 250k.   you did n't specifically ask about ach transfers which as littleadv pointed out are different from wire transfers but since ach transfers can often form a part of the whole process i 'll explain that process too ach is a payment processing system that works through the federal reserve system among others the federal reserve through the and systems is by far the largest payment processor   the physical cash itself is n't transferred in simple terms the money is transferred through the ach system between the accounts each bank maintains at the federal reserve   here is a simple example of how the process works i 'm summarizing the example from wikipedia let 's say that bob has an account with chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer stack exchange directly deposited into this account assume that stack exchange uses bank of america as their bank   bob the receiver fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer called the originator once the originator has the authorization they create an entry with an originating depository financial institution which acts as a middleman between a payment processor like the federal reserve and the originator the odfi ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations in this example bank of america is the odfi   bank of america the odfi converts the transaction request into an ach entry and submits it through an ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi which in this case is chase bank chase credits deposits the paycheck in bob 's account   the federal reserve fits into all of this in several ways through systems like and the fed acts as an ach operator and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the federal reserve so it 's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks

do n't do it until you have educated yourself enough to know what you are doing i hope you wo n't take this personally but given that you are wandering around asking random strangers on the internet how to get into investing i feel safe in concluding that you are by no means a sophisticated enough investor to be choosing individual investments nor should you be trusting financial advisors to choose investments for you believe me they do not have your interests at heart i usually advise people in your position to start by reading one book a random walk down wall street by burton malkiel once you 've read the book by malkiel you 'll understand that the best strategy for all but the most sophisticated investors is to buy an index fund which simply purchases a portfolio of all available stocks without trying to pick winners and losers the best index funds are at vanguard there is also a vanguard site for non us residents vanguard is one of the very very very few honest players in the business unlike almost any other mutual fund vanguard is owned by its investors so it has no profit motive they never try to pick individual stocks so they do n't have to pay fancy high priced analysts to pick stocks if you find it impossible to open a vanguard account from wherever you 're living find a local brokerage account that will allow you to invest in the us stock market many vanguard mutual funds are available as etfs which means that you buy and sell them just like any other stock on the us market which should be easy to do from any reasonably civilized place

it is possible to not use checks in the us i personally use a credit card for almost everything and often have no cash in my wallet at all i never carry checks with me if we wanted to we could pay all of our monthly bills without checks as well and many people do this 30 years ago grocery stores did n't generally accept credit cards so it was cash or check though most other kinds of stores and restaurants did now the only stores that i have encountered in years that do not accept credit cards are a local chicken restaurant and the warehouse shopping store costco costco accepts its own credit card but not mastercard or visa still we do pay the majority of our monthly bills via check and it would not be shocking to see someone paying for groceries with a check i ca n't name the last time i saw someone write a check at a store exactly but i 've never seen any cashier or other patrons wonder what a check writer was trying to do large transactions like buying a car or house would still use checks probably cashier 's or certified checks and not personal checks though

there 's no free lunch here are some positions that should be economically equivalent same risk and reward in a theoretically pure universe with no regulations or transaction costs you 're proposing to buy the call if you look at the equivalent stock plus protective put you can quickly see the catch the protective put is expensive that same expense is embedded in the call option see put call parity on wikipedia for more you could easily pay 10 a year or more for the protection which could easily eat up most of your returns if you consider that average returns on a stock index might be about 10 nominal not real another way to look at it is that buying the long call and selling a put which is a synthetic long position in the stock would give you the put premium so by not selling the put you should be worse off than owning the stock worse than the synthetic long by about the value of the put premium or yet another way to look at it is that you 're repeatedly paying time value on the long call option as you roll it in practical world instead of theory world i think you 'd probably get a noticeable hit to returns just from bid ask and commissions even without the cost of the protection options cost more a bit some practical complications of equivalency between different combinations of options and underlying are anyway roughly speaking any position without the downside risk is going to have an annual loss built in due to the cost of the protection occasionally the options market can do something weird due to supply demand or liquidity issues but mostly the parity relationships hold or hold closely enough that you ca n't profit once expenses are considered update one note i 'm talking about vanilla options as traded in the us here i guess there are some somewhat different products elsewhere i 'm not sure exactly which derivatives you mean all derivatives have a cost though or nobody would take the other side of the trade

1 your oldest active credit agreement is not very old this is fairly straight forward if you 've not been exposed to borrowing for a reasonable length of time people wo n't want to lend you money they have no reason to have any confidence in your ability to repay them as other said it 's pretty much a case of proving yourself by being good with credit over a period of time 2 you have no active credit card accounts credit reference agencies have to consider a variety of factors for a variety of purposes notably they will be used for credit cards unsecured loans mortgages and secured loans such as vehicle finance applications these all have varying types of customer and some will be inherently more risky than others for instance someone with a mortgage on a home is far more likely to make payments because they would be homeless without however someone with a finance agreement on a car is relatively less likely to make those payments because all they stand to lose is their car consider that the most fruitful information the lender will get is a score and some breakdown of how it 's generated it 's a very general understanding of your history for that reason having a wide variety of credit is very important a good variety of credit to have would be one secured loan e.g car finance to get started as well as at least one revolving unsecured credit account e.g a credit card and later on in your credit life an unsecured fixed term loan e.g a loan for something which has nothing secured against it i say the above because that 's how i increased my credit score from 450 to 999 first step was the car finance where in 3 months or so i changed from 450 to around 600 with a credit card i was approaching 900 and once i had an unsecured loan for 8 months i hit 999 now i have all of the above plus a competitive mortgage and remain at 999 whether each is mandatory to maintain 999 is debatable but based on personal experience it seems reasonable

want but guess what those people who have to deal with that enforcement agency are going to call it government or big brother or the cops or whatever the point being at the end of a day does n't it equate to the same thing how will this enforcement agency get paid are they going to sell tickets are they going to make a product or service outside of enforcement probably not otherwise they are going to gain a reputation for having a conflict of interest and always have the suspicion of corruption hanging over them so then we are back to some form of tax on the market in order to pay for enforcement and what do we call that ladies and gentlemen a government   gt kansas   you dug down into the specifics which i appreciate most people just go he did n't reduce taxes and spending enough and that is why it failed and that is why they are now raising taxes to pay for gaping deficits    okay so lets say you are correct about kansas lets do some apples to apples comparisons most people say okay lets compare texas and california our two biggest gdp states i am fine with that even though their gdp comes from very different sources ca is a technology state while tx is an oil state they both have a little bit of farming on top of that ca has one of the highest and strictest tax policies of any state in the union tx is known for being a business friendly state and a tax although they surely do n't have a zero tax policy not having an income tax is nice while they have one of the highest real estate taxes of any state    ca currently has a gdp growth rate of california brown are jobs california growing hell lot faster and has a job growth rate that exceeds the national average tx is has fallen below the national average on both aspects mostly because of the oversupply of oil on the global market and of course tx was one of the top states while oil was up but still was ca the point being is that their very different tax policies did not make or break their positions and many would argue that tax policy can help gdp when it builds stability and infrastructure while states like ks seem to show the opposite to be true    lets do another comparison and see if we can get even more apples to apples lets find a couple of states the sit right next to each other have very similar economies and demographics but very different views on taxes and infrastructure how about wi and mn ks and mi nh and me and or and id    conservative with very lenient tax policy an emphasis on freedom and reduced government wi ks me and id liberal states with emphasis on infrastructure and social services mn nh or mi    in all of the above examples the liberal states exceeded the conservative states in job growth and gdp growth this does n't mean the liberal state exceeded the national average in the ks mi and mn wi examples both states lagged the national average however in both examples the liberal state better    people could argue it is in spite of the increased taxes or they could try to find minute differences in the economies those states are pretty close and yet the liberal states exceeded the conservative states    this can be seen on a global scale as well it is almost as if people need a safety network and stability before they are able to produce it is hard to concentrate on innovation and invention while you are worried about being able to buy groceries

it was actually meant to be more of just a joke comment but it does n't take very many successful billion dollar lawsuits to justify $ 10 million a pop   personally i think that part of the patent reform solution is that patents are non exclusive however licensing must be set up before use including free licensing if the owner wants to public domain it if the two parties ca n't agree to terms then it goes to a to set the the licensing fees which is binding the arbitration will take into account the research and development costs required likelihood of the same thing being independently created estimated profits from products using the patent etc   of course the core issue is granting patents for silly stuff but since the ones already in existence are presumably grandfathered in i think enforcing market driven licensing fees is the best way to prevent all of the dumb lawsuits going on the patent holder gets its money or maintains market advantage if the licensing fee is so high that no one wants to pay it and it does n't prevent competition from using other another party 's patented ideas

in theory you do n't have to pay income tax in such a situation in actual fact the transaction looks suspicious because the money went into your account   presumably the money should have gone out of your account in equal amount   having allowed all this to happen what you need to do is to document this activity asap the first thing to do is to retain the paperwork showing the sending of the funds to the third party the second thing to do is to ask your friend for a letter dated today do n't use an earlier date as to why the money was delivered into your account and the fact that it was sent to the third party then if the irs comes calling you will have documentation to prove your point and protect yourself

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

as someone that works in finance i will say it is really hard to get out of the sales web regardless of where you are   i do n't want to discourage you but you will need to get advanced degrees certification to get into analysis or fund management there are plenty of broker service roles available at large broker dealers but you will take a pay cut and likely only advance to your current pay in those roles and you will still have some soft sales responsibilities   all that being said if you want to go this route go for it and the sooner the better if you are smart and hardworking you can wrap up your bachelors in 2 years and then go for the cfa over the next 3 you 'll need some luck to do the cfa in that amount of time as there are 3 levels that take a minimum of 1 year each to complete but you could potentially have some traction in 5 6 years    so it would be difficult but achievable the cfa will qualify you for some corporate finance roles as well i have some friends that were hired to these positions after only passing the first or second levels of cfa but i believe they had accounting finance background already   i think that regardless of your intermediate term plan getting a bachelors is a great next move it 's a minimum in a growing number of financial roles you can also look at getting the cfp which is less demanding and quicker but it will remove you less from the sales process you need a bachelors to qualify for the cfp too

edit quid identified the reverse split in may 2017   in a reverse split your shares are worth 7 times as much per share but you have the amount of shares   a share worth $ now was worth all else being equal $ a month ago    so a call with a $ 2.50 strike a month ago was well out of the money and would now be the equivalent of a call with a $ strike   a $ call with a $ underlying or a $ 2.50 call with a $ underlying would reasonably be worth only 5 cents so i now suspect that the quote is a stale quote that existed pre split and has n't been adjusted by the provider old answer i can find no valid reason why those calls would be so cheap   the stock price has been trending down from its onset in 2000 so either no one expects it to be above $ 2.50 in a month or it 's so illiquid that there 's not any real data to evaluate the options   they did pay some massive 30 dividends in 2010 and 2012 they 've been cash for the past 4 years at least and i have found at least on strong sell rating so there 's not much to be optimistic about   nasdaq does not list any options for the stock so it must be an otc trade    with an ask size of 10 you could buy calls on 1,000 shares for $ 0.05 so if you can afford to lose $ 50 and want to take a flyer you can give it a shot but i suspect it 's not a valid quote and is something that 's been manufactured by the option broker

budget figure out how much money you need to keep for your own spending purposes then figure out from that how much you can afford to move to longer term savings for and/or the kid try it for a while see if it works adjust how much you can afford to save repeat actually you want to further reduce the savings a bit until the emergency fund comes up to a level you feel comfortable at then increase them to acceptable targets it 's ok if you miss or reduce some deposits to the savings plans while you get the emergency fund up to a level you 're comfortable at if you do n't feel you 're saving enough after making these adjustments you need to somewhere so you have more money to save or make more money or your expectations you ca n't get a gallon out of a container

sipc is a corporation a legal entity separate from its owners in the case of sipc it is funded through the fees paid by its members all the us brokers are required to be members and to contribute to sipc funds can it go bankrupt of course any legal entity can go bankrupt a person can go bankrupt a country can go bankrupt and so can anything in between however looking at the history of things there are certain assumptions that can be made these are mere guesses as there 's no law about any of these things to the best of my knowledge but seeing how things were we can try and guess that they will also be like this in the future i would guess that in case of a problem for the sipc to meet its obligation any of the following would happen or combinations too big to fail large insurance companies had been bailed out before by the governments since it was considered that their failure would be more destructive to the economy than the bailout aig as an example in the us sipc is in essence is an insurance company so is lloyd 's of london breach of trust of the individual investors that can lead to a significant market crash that 's what happened in the us to fannie mae and freddie mac they 're now officially backed by the us government if sipc is incapable of meeting its obligation i would definitely expect the us government to step in even though there 's no such obligation raising funds through charging other members if the actuary calculations were incorrect the insurance companies adjust them and raise premiums that is what should happen in this case as well while may not necessarily solve a cashflow issue in the long term it will allow sipc to balance so that bridge loans from the us government feds public bonds could be used in between not meeting obligations i.e. bankruptcy that is an option and insurance companies have gone bankrupt before not unheard of but from the past experience again i 'd expect the us government to step in in general i do n't see any significant difference between sipc in the us and a generic insurance coverage elsewhere except that in the us sipc is mandatory well regulated and the coverage is uniform across brokerages which is a benefit to the consumer

i invested in prosper.com loans   i 'm getting out   i only have about $ 37 left and as the principal is back to me i withdraw the money   the default rate i experienced was over 30   only six of the 53 loans i invested in were with borrowers whose credit rating was less than a.   borrowers with a rating of a and aa had a higher proportion of defaults that those below a some of my blogging colleagues were wise enough not to start this game some who invest in other p2p lending are almost certainly doing it with found money   they post articles with affiliate links   as people sign up they get the commissions deposited in their accounts which they invest   as they update their blogs with the returns on their portfolio it serves to encourage more signups and the machine continues on   even if they lose money on the invested loans they 're still ahead   to paraphrase john 's   they make money with lending club by telling people how much money they 're making with lending club   it 's almost like investing with the house 's money my high default rate might be because i started earlier in the game   borrower screening and criteria have gotten tighter with time i do n't recommend investing in p2p loans   my experience has been that a large percentage of borrowers requesting loans on these sites have run out of options which the credit reporting does n't reflect accurately enough

since this post was migrated from parenting my reply was in the context where it appeared to be misrepresenting facts to make a point i 've edited it to be more concise to my main point in my opinion the best way to save for your future is to get rid of as much of your own debt as possible starting today for the average american a car is 6 10 most people have at least a couple credit cards ranging from 10 25 no crap college loans can be all over the map 5 15 as can be signature 8 15 or secured bank loans 4 8 try to stop living within your credit and live within your means yeah it will suck to not go to movies or shop for cute things at kohl 's but only today   first incur no more debt then the easiest way i found to pay things off is to use your tax returns and reduce your cable service both potentially $ ks per year to pay off a big debt like a car or student loan you just gave yourself an immediate raise of whatever your payment is if you think long term we 're talking about long term savings for a college there are things you can do to pay off debt and save money without having to take up a 2nd job but you have to think in terms of years not months is this kind of thing pie in the sky yes and no but it takes a plan and diligence for example we have no tv service internet only service redirected an additional $ 100/mo to the lone credit card and we used 12 taxes to pay off the last 4k on the car we did the same thing on our van last year it takes willpower to not cheat but that 's only really necessary for the first year ish well before that point you 'll be used to the diet on your wallet and will have no desire to cheat it does n't really hurt your quality of life do you really need 5 hbo channels and it sets everyone up for success down the line the moral of the story is that by paying down your debt today you 're taking steps to reduce long haul expenditures a stable household economy is a tremendous foundation for raising children and can set you up to be more able to deal with the costs of higher ed

i have a couple other important considerations regarding external hsa accounts vs employer sponsored hsa accounts depending on your personal financial situation and goals some people like to use hsa accounts as an extra retirement account since the money can be withdrawn penalty free in retirement for non medical expenses and completely tax penalty free at any time for medical expenses if your intended use for the hsa account is an investment vehicle for retirement then you may find more use benefit out of an external provider that may provide more or better investment options than your employers hsa investment options there can be a lot of additional value in those extra investment options over greater periods of time another very important consideration for fica taxes fica includes social security medicare that i do n't believe was mentioned before for those earners who are under the maximum social security wage limit you are paying 6.2 of each paycheck into social security taxes as others have mentioned you can save this tax through your employer ’s plan if you set up the account to be funded pre tax from your paychecks however in doing so you are lowering your overall contributions into social security which may lower your social security benefits in your retirement years   if this is ultimately going to lower your ssa benefits in retirement then that is a big future cost that may steer you against the pre tax employer contributions think of social security as part of your retirement plan not as a tax but instead as an additional check you put away for yourself for retirement every month of course this is only an important consideration if ssa is still going to be around when you retire but let 's assume that it will be this is not an issue for higher earners earning well above the max ssa taxable wages there is no wage limit on the 1.45 medicare tax withholding 's and there is certainly no harm in saving medicare taxes because it will not affect future medicare benefits so for taxpayers earning well over the max ssa wages they will just save the 1.45 medicare taxes without affecting their ssa contributions and resulting retirement benefits   so again it all comes down to personal situations depending on your earnings and goals employer plan may or may not be the way to go   personally for my lower earning clients friends and family i tend to recommend that they do whatever they can to maximize their social security benefits in retirement so i would advise them to either use the external provider account or the employer plan but with post tax contributions so you do n't lower the ssa withholding 's but can still claim the income tax deduction on your tax return ymmv

no one can claim markets are perfectly efficient the stiglitz paradox explains one reason why it is impossible for the market to be perfectly and there are plenty of investors that show it is practically possible to consistently beat the market e.g. the of graham and or 's medallion fund   however even if you accept as true that prices behave strangely around round numbers that is n't a of the efficient market hypothesis the efficient market hypothesis says that price reflect all available information so the expected price tomorrow is just the price today not taking into account the time value of money   the efficient market hypothesis says nothing about how prices are distributed historically a random walk has been used but that is neither a consequence of the emh nor a required assumption   you could say that prices are more volatile the nearer they are to a round number or new high but that does n't necessarily give you an edge in making money off the stock

paying down your mortgage now will decrease the total cost of your home loan and the time period for which your loan lasts even if you trade up in that time period you will be that much closer to being free of house payments owning your home outright gives you a significant amount of freedom to consider less lucrative and more personally fulfilling career especially if your work environment becomes unpleasant it can also help you weather the storm of a job loss more easily though you should also build an emergency fund homes are depreciating illiquid assets with significant transaction fees it is wise to get a starter home that meets your current needs and move up to a home that better meets your needs as you mature however getting on the status treadmill and buying large homes that generally exceed the utility that you get out of them is expensive a poor investment and often impairs the ability to generate long term wealth

simple answer breakeven is when the security being traded reaches a price equal to the cost of the option plus the option 's strike price assuming you choose to exercise it so for example if you paid $ 1.00 for say a call option with a strike price of $ breakeven would be when the security itself reaches $ 20.00   that being said i ca n't imagine why you 'd close out a position at the breakeven point   you would n't make or lose money doing that so it would n't be rational now as the option approaches expiration you may make adjustments to the position to reflect shifts in momentum of the stock   so if it looks as though the stock may not reach the option strike price you could close out the position and take your   but if the stock has momentum that will carry it past the strike price by expiration you may choose to augment your position with additional contracts although this would obviously mean the new contracts would be priced higher which raises your dollar cost basis and this may not make much sense another option in this scenario is that if the stock is going to surpass strike price it might be a good opportunity to buy additional calls with either later expiration dates or with higher strike prices depending on how much higher you speculate the stock will climb   i 've managed to make some money doing this buying options with strike prices just a dollar or two higher or lower when playing puts because the premiums were in my opinion underpriced to the potential peak of the stock by the expiration date   sometimes the new options were actually slightly cheaper than my original positions so my dollar cost basis overall dropped somewhat improving my profit percentages

the fact that this is what ’s being reported is horribly misleading   at the bottom of the same page of that report there is data intended to show the difference between the pay rates in this data accidently proves that individual incomes are still stagnant and that the reason for our increased household wages is that more people per household are working and part timers are working longer hours following is how this conclusion is drawn   the section titled earnings of full time year round workers can be used to find 2015 ’s average income per full time worker and 2016 ’s average income per full time worker the 2015 data shows that men made up of the full time year round working population and earned $ women made up of the full time year round working population and earned $ this means that the average income for a full time year round worker in 2015 was $ x + x   the 2016 data shows that men made up of the full time year round working population and earned $ women made up of the population and earned $ this means the average income for a full time year round worker in 2016 was $ x + x   so while the news is reporting the increase in household income the average income for a full time year round worker actually fell by $ in 2016

your plan will work to increase your total credit capacity good for your credit score and reduce your utilization also good   as mentioned you will need to be careful to use these cards periodically or they will get closed but it will work the question is whether this will help you or not   in addition to credit capacity and utilization your credit score looks at things like these factors may hurt you as you continue to open accounts   you can easily get to the stage where your score is not benefitting much from increased capacity and it is getting hurt a lot by pulls and low average age btw you are correct that closing accounts generally hurts your score   it probably reduces average age may reduce maximum age reduces your capacity and increases your utilization

some basic thoughts mostly on fairness i guess the answer does n't really fit this site it 's more about ethics but this fits the question which is n't really just about money either so when both work the same amount it seems appropriate that both get the same mount of money does n't it that is the scheme of as already contained in your question and in some other answers is fair by this logic pay attention to hidden money for example the one who works more for money might automatically get a pension funded this way this is hidden money which already goes to only one partner so when dividing equally you 'll need to take that into account or just include equal pensions for both in the family 's needs directly

the avalanche method does not work because most people do n't have enough money to make an avalanche   if you somehow had a windfall that was greater or equal to your highest credit card balance then by all means pay that one off    however most people do not have that kind of situation   instead they should use the debt snow ball method   they only have regular income that is typically much smaller then the balances another part of your plan that is especially troubling is that you are continuing to utilize credit cards   you need to cut them up and stop using them   first of course save $ 1000 for a small emergency fund the pay them off smallest to largest   do a budget each and every month   work an extra job or three   any extra money that hubby brings in goes towards one of the credit cards btw you do n't have a math problem you have a behavior problem

are financial institutions less likely to lend me money because of my age yes   but they are especially unlikely to loan you money because you have little income    or because they know i avoid interest by paying things off aggressively this wo n't affect them   but you might ask yourself how much credit history you have   credit history can include all of loans credit cards rent utilities etc   you mention three loans   but you do n't mention rent or utilities   you may simply not have much credit history even if what you do have is good    but again the biggest thing that they will look at is your income history   if you have a small income then it does n't matter what your payment history is   they do n't want to loan money to people who need money   they want to loan money to people who do n't need to borrow but are instead bringing a future purchase into the present    the ideal recipient is someone who has a high income and spends it all every month   such a person is likely to borrow heavily but be able to keep up the payments    obsessing about your ability to borrow is probably the wrong approach   instead focus on how you can meet your goals without borrowing   eventually your ability to pay will catch up   then they 'll offer you money   of course you might not need it then    note that when i say little income i 'm talking about their perspective   you may be fully on track and making decent money or even very good money for your age   but they 're looking for people who are mature in their careers and regularly bringing home large sums but who spend it faster than they can get it

there are two or three issues here one is how quickly can you get cash out of your investments if you had an unexpected expense if you suddenly needed more cash than you have on hand how long would it take to get money out of your scott trade account or wherever it is i have a td ameritrade account which is pretty similar and it just takes a couple of days to get money out i 'm hard pressed to think of a time when i literally needed a bunch of cash today with no advance warning what sudden bills is one likely to have a medical bill perhaps but hey just a few weeks ago i had to go to the emergency room with a medical problem and it 's not like they demanded cash on the table before they 'd help me i just got the bill maybe 3 weeks after the event i 've never decided to move and then actually moved 2 days later these things take some planning etc second how much risk are you willing to tolerate if you have your money in the stock market the market could go down just as you need the cash that 's not even a worst case scenario extreme scenario after all if the economy gets bad the stock market could go down and the same fact could result in your employer laying you off that said you could reduce this risk by keeping some of your money in a low risk investment like some high quality bonds third you want to have cash to cover the more modest routine expenses like make sure you always have enough cash on hand to pay the rent or mortgage buy food and so on and fourth you want to keep a cushion against bookkeeping mistakes i 've had twice in my life that i 've overdrawn a checking account not because i was broke but because i messed up my records and thought i had more money in the account than i really did it 's impossible to give exact numbers without knowing a lot about your income and expenses but for myself i keep a cushion of $ 1,000 to $ in my checking account on top of all regular bills that i know i 'll have to pay in the next month to cover modest unexpected expenses and mistakes i pay most of my bills by credit card for convenience pay the balance in full when i get the bill so i do n't pay interest so i do n't need a lot of cushion i used to keep 2 to 3 months pay in an account invested in bonds and very safe stocks something that would n't lose much value even in bad times since my daughter started college i 've run this down to less than 1 months pay and instead of replacing that money i 'm instead putting my spare money into more general stocks which is admittedly riskier so between the two accounts i have a little over 2 months pay which i think is low but as i say i 'm trying to get my kids through college so i 've run down my savings some i think if i had more than 6 months pay in easily liquidated assets then unless i expected to need a bunch of cash for something buying a new house or some such i 'd be transferring that to a retirement account with tax advantages

the notion that you can put product on the web and sit back and watch the money roll in is a myth plain and simple   if you put content on the web and expect people to pay money for your products t shirts etc you have to do the work to get your stuff seen by people and preferably the right kind of people who will buy your stuff that means you need to know your market and provide something that they are eager to pay for this does n't necessarily mean buying advertising to direct traffic to your site there are plenty of no cost ways to bring people to your web site but instead of costing $ $ the cost is in effort and time that you have to put into it also keep in mind that the more participants you have in your production and fulfillment pipeline the less you will make off every sale hands off production services like or cafe press do everything for you all you have to do is provide the artwork   however they also take all the income and pay you a rather percentage of sales   you can get a larger percentage of sales if you do more of the work yourself like handmade items sold on etsy   but then you 're doing work maybe you 'll get $ 1 for each t shirt you sell   if you just upload your artwork to the production service and type in some product description text into their web sales catalog how many sales will you make in the first month   most likely somewhere between zero and two   why should anyone buy your shirt over the tens of thousands of other designs carried by the same production service   it 's your responsibility to tell people about your stuff and send them to the site to buy it   and that means it 's not a passive income for truly passive income invest in bank cd 's treasury bonds or in stocks that pay dividends   the only problem with that is you have to have money to make money this way

it is really hard to tell where you should withdraw money from so instead i 'll give you some pointers to make it easier for you to make the decision for yourself while keeping the answer useful to others as well i have 3 401ks and some has post tax non roth money why keeping 3 401ks you can roll them over into an ira or the one 401k which is still active i assume here you 're not currently employed with 3 different employers this will also help you avoiding fees for too low balances on your iras however for the 401k with after tax not roth balance read the next part carefully post tax amounts are your basis generally it is not a good idea to keep post tax amounts in 401k ira you usually do post tax contributions to convert them to roth asap withdrawing from 401k with basis may become a mess since you 'll have to account for the basis portion of each withdrawal especially if you pool it with iras so that one do n't rollover keep it separately to make that accounting easier i also have several smaller iras and roth iras keep in mind the rmd requirements roth iras do n't have those and are non taxable income so you would probably want to keep them as long as possible this is relevant for 401k as well again consolidating will help you with the fees i 'm concerned about having easily accessible cash for emergencies i suggest keeping roth amounts for this purpose as they 're easily accessible and bear no taxable consequence other than emergencies do n't touch them for as long as you can i do have some other money in taxable investments for those consider re balancing to a more conservative style but beware of the capital gains taxes if you have a lot of gains accumulated you may want consider loss harvesting selling the positions in the red to liquidate investments without adverse tax consequences while getting some of your cash back into the checking account in any case depending on your tax bracket capital gains taxes are generally lower down to 0 than ordinary income taxes which is what you pay for ira/401k withdrawals so you would probably want to start with these after careful planning and taking the rmd and the social security if you 're getting any into account

the previous answers make valid points regarding the risks and why you ca n't reasonably compare trading for profit loss to a roll of the die this answer looks at the math instead your assumption i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss is incorrect for the reasons stated in other answers however the answer to your question can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do worst than random is yes but only because the question is flawed consequently it 's throwing people in all directions with their answers but quite simply in a truly random environment the worst case scenario no matter how improbable is that you lose over and over again until you have nothing left this can happen in sequential rolls of the dice and in trading securities bonds whatever you could guess wrong for every roll of the die and all of your stock picks could become worthless both outcomes result in $ 0 assuming you do not gamble with credit tell me which $ 0 is worse given the infinite number of plays that random implies the chance of losing your entire bankroll exists in both scenarios and that is enough by itself to make neither option worse than the other of course the opposite is also true you could only pick winners with an unlimited upside potential but again that could happen with either dice rolls or stock picks it 's just highly improbable my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit nope this is where it all falls apart just because your chances of losing it all are similarly improbable does not make you more likely to win with one method or the other regression to the mean when given infinite truly random outcomes makes it impossible to have an edge also probabilistically is n't a word but probably is

inflation will hurt your landlord but it wo n't hurt you in either case you have to pay 7200 regardless of how much inflation has increased over two years   however they are not equivalent to you if you take the monthly payment then you can potentially come out ahead if you were to take the 7200 and put it in a savings account and just pay monthly then you 'll be earning interest that you would n't get if you paid up front   there 's a whole lot of other investment options you could go with too but that 's another question the risk here is that if you go through financial hardship you may be tempted to draw on that 7200 early and come up short for rent one month

your idea is a good one but as usual the devil is in the details and implementation might not be as easy as you think   the comments on the question have pointed out your steps 2 and 4 are   not necessarily the best way of doing things and that perhaps   keeping the principal   amount invested in the same fund instead of taking it all out and re investing it in a similar but different fund might be better the other points for you to consider are as follows how do you identify which of the thousands of conventional mutual   funds and etfs is the average risk high gain mutual fund into which you will place your initial investment   broadly speaking most actively managed mutual fund with average risk are likely to give you   less than average gains over long periods of time   the   unfortunate truth to which many pay only service is that   x% of actively managed mutual funds   in a specific category failed   to beat the average gain of all funds in that category or the   corresponding index e.g. s&p 500 index for large stock mutual funds over the past n years where x is generally between 70 and   100 and n is 5 10 15 etc   indeed one of the arguments in   favor of investing in a very low cost index fund is that you are effectively guaranteed the average gain or loss do n't forget the possibility of loss this of course is also the argument used against investing in index funds   why invest in boring index funds and settle for average gains at essentially no risk of not getting the average performance average performance is close to guaranteed when you can   get much more out of your investments by investing in a fund that is among the funds that had better than average returns   the difficulty is that which funds are x rated and which non x rated i.e. rated g = good or pg = pretty good is known only in hindsight whereas what you need is foresight as everyone will tell you past performance does not guarantee future results   as someone john bogle said   when you invest in a mutual fund you are in the position of a in you can see where you have been but not where you are going   in summary implementation of your strategy needs a good crystal ball to look into the future there is no such things as a guaranteed bond fund they also have risks though not necessarily the same as in a stock mutual fund you need to have a plan b in mind in case your chosen mutual fund takes a longer time than expected to return the 10 gain that you want to use to trigger profit taking and investment of the gain into a low risk bond fund and also maybe a plan c in case the of the market cause your chosen mutual fund to have negative return for some time what is the exit strategy

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

while it is not common it is also not uncommon   a subtle distinction if you are poor you almost certainly get some kind of government assistance not even talking about obamacare or but just general assistance if you are middle class or rich that is where you get hit the most   they seem to realize you ca n't get blood from a stone and do n't try to get payment out of poor people but middle class and rich people yes it just takes longer but they do hang in there with billing my own experience is that years and years ago way before obamacare i had a time in the hospital with a lot of tests but i was poor and sleeping on a relatives floor at the time i got all the tests i needed and they took great care of me and the hospital wrote it off as charity care

it says amazon has no profits or very low profits but the value of the company is very high and growing because of the high revenue all of the returns to investors are in the form of increased share price which is n't realized or taxed until the shares are sold this is n't a loophole anybody can run a business where they spend most of their revenue on operating costs and run on very slim margins with the goal of growing the revenue

it could be a a way to preserve the value of your money but depends upon various factors if a country defaults and it leads to hyper inflation by definition that means that money loses its purchasing power   in even simpler terms it can not buy as much tomorrow as i could today therefore people can be to either hoard physical goods or other non perishable items real estate may well be such an item   if you are resident in the country you have to live somewhere   it is possible that a landlord might try to raise rent beyond what your job is willing to pay   of course in a house you might have a similar situation with utilities like electricity assuming some kind of re stabilization of the economy and currency even with several more zeros on the end it is conceivable that the house would subsequently sell for an appropriately inflation adjusted amount as other in demand physical goods may lots of variables good luck

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

it depends on whether or not you are referring to realized or unrealized gains   if the asset appreciation is realized meaning you 've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it then has provided a good route to follow    however if the gains are unrealized meaning only that the current value of the underlying have increased or decreased then you might want to record this under an income unrealized gains account   one of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event realized or just want to better track your net worth at a given time unrealized    for example i generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest dividends and contributions as income from an income unrealized gains account   i can still reconcile it with my statements and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything    and no i do n't create an additional expense account here to track losses   just think of unrealized gains as an income account where the balance will fluctuate up and down and potentially even go negative over time

years ago i wrote an article risk reward coin flipping which explains from a game theory perspective how diversifying works to minimize standard deviation in one 's returns   it 's long and tedious not easy to summarize but it holds up well i 'm pleased with how the analogy does its job   update the above is too link only written over 5 years ago the article i wrote offers a mathematical approach via an understandable example of coin flipping with just 2 options a head is a 10 loss while a tail is a 30 gain this actually represents the market fairly well as it results in a 10 average gain and 28 standard deviation for just 2 flips the article shows how by diversifying choosing to make multiple smaller bets the average 10 stays the same but the standard deviation is brought down dramatically 7.6 when we use a sample experiment with 7 coins

i highly doubt this was a mistake in the event of a corporate merger buyout changes to employee 401(k plans are usually hashed out as part of the agreement the choices made in the agreement depend on numerous factors so it may be difficult to predict what happens to your plan in situations like this a quick online search reveals a few articles e.g. this one from that list the three most common consequences for retirement plans it sounds like the company that purchased your employer agreed to immediately vest employees in employer 401(k contributions as part of the purchase agreement without knowing the details of the merger buyout i ca n't say this for sure but this sounds like a plausible way to keep employees of the purchased company content   rather than roll it over does it make sense to wait for that company to be purchased in the hopes that a similar mistake occurs since this does n't sound like a mistake but rather a part of the buyout agreement i do n't think it 's something you should count on in the future it may be very likely or it could be a relatively rare occurrence that happened to be part of this purchase agreement i do n't believe the employee retirement income security act regulates what can or ca n't be done to your 401(k in a buyout except that the company is required to inform you of any changes and obviously the new 401(k plan must conform to erisa as well

the new york times has a useful rent vs buy calculator   based on your numbers it suggests buying makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more   this is just based on default values for various other parameters though like mortgage interest rate rent increase rate etc   you could try playing around with the numbers   also as other said maintenance costs closing costs etc should be factored in if renting it out is a possibility even if you move out it could be a better deal   one thing to think about renting wise is if you move out where are you likely to move to   if you move far away it could be impractical to manage the property as a rental   you could hire someone else to do that but that would reduce your income from the rent   on the other hand if you stay in la it could be feasible to manage the property yourself another key factor is what rent would you be able to charge for this house   if you can make enough in rent to cover the mortgage payment you may be in good shape but due to overpriced real estate markets sometimes you wo n't be able to do that which would mean renting it might not be cost effective

publication covers this in a fairly specific manner page 11 section are you covered by an employer plan specifies the form w-2 you receive from your employer has a box    used to indicate whether you were covered for the year    the retirement plan box should be checked if you were    covered so by default if that 's checked you 're covered   590 does go into more detail though assuming you 're covered under a defined contribution plan a 401k for example defined contribution plan generally you are covered    by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if amounts are    contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year    that ends with or within that tax year   tax year tax year your tax year is the annual accounting period    you use to keep records and report income and expenses    on your income tax return for almost all people the tax    year is the calendar year further they cover issues related to an employee leaving dec. 31 very specifically a special rule applies to certain plans in which it is not    possible to determine if an amount will be contributed to    your account for a given plan year if for a plan year no    amounts have been allocated to your account that are attributable    to employer contributions employee contributions    or by the last day of the plan year and    contributions are discretionary for the plan year you are    not covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends if    after the plan year ends the employer makes a contribution    for that plan year you are covered for the tax year in    which the contribution is made example example mickey was covered by a profit sharing plan    and left the company on december 31 2014 the plan    year runs from july 1 to june 30 under the terms of the    plan employer contributions do not have to be made but    if they are made they are contributed to the plan before    the due date for filing the company 's tax return such contributions    are allocated as of the last day of the plan year    and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals    who have any service during the plan year as of june 30    2015 no contributions were made that were allocated to    the june 30 2015 plan year and no had been    allocated within the plan year in addition as of that date    the company was not obligated to make a contribution for    such plan year and it was impossible to determine    whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan    year on december 31 2015 the company decided to    contribute to the plan for the plan year ending june 30    2015 that contribution was made on february 15 2016    mickey is an active participant in the plan for his 2016 tax    year but not for his 2015 tax year mickey is in a similar but different circumstance and it 's clear from the irs 's treatment of his circumstance that you would be in the same boat just a year less off but be aware given mickey 's situation that it 's theoretically possible for them to make another contribution next year as mickey had depending on when their plan year etc ends so from the irs 's point of view everything you said the company did is correct   they paid you in january contributed to your 401k as a result of that paycheck and thus you were officially considered covered for 2015

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

basically you have purchased 25 of the condo for $ 40,000 and your parents bought 75 of the condo for another $ 115,000 we imagine for a moment that it was n't you who lived in the condo but some unrelated person paying rent   you are paying $ 7,500 a year for tax and fees plus $ 6,000 a year so there is $ leaving your wallet if $ a year was a reasonable rent then the tax and fee would be paid out of that there would be $ 8,000 left of which you would get 25 = $ 2,000 if you were officially renting it you would pay $ a year and get $ 2,000 back again $ leaving your wallet so you are in exact the same situation financially as you would be if you paid $ rent    question is $ a year or $ a month an appropriate rent for your condo if a neighbour is renting his condo is he or she paying $ or more or less could you rent the same place for the same money if $ is the correct rent then you are fine if the rent should be lower then you are overpaying if the rent should be higher then you are making money   keep in mind that you will also be winning if rents go up in the future

if your sister paid rent she was a tenant there are laws to protect tenants but those depend on what country state and city you live in in most places in the us maybe all she was owed more than 2 days notice normally the local housing authority could help her figure out what her rights are but since this already happened they may not be able to do much depends on the local laws it 's worth asking them anyway i do n't know how partial ownership of the property would affect things if your sister was a partial owner if the 30 year old will was the most recent document then that 's how the estate will be distributed there are no laws in the us requiring a will to be fair an executor 's role is to carry out the will being an executor does not mean one can choose to unilaterally sell the property in the estate without permission of other heirs you 'll need to speak with a lawyer if you think they 're breaking the will by selling property that you have partial ownership of but since the sale is already done reversing it would be slow and probably very expensive in legal fees if it 's a small estate you 'll have to judge whether a lawyer is worth the money and the family 's also if the estate had debt debt must be paid before property is distributed to the heirs so that could also change what your sisters had to do   i 'd suggest first asking your sisters to tell   you about what they 've done to execute the will and what they do in the future

yes there is an inverse relationship but that 's how it 's meant to work   debt creates money banks do lend out customers savings for return interest as the bank can make a profit rather than the cash just sitting there the process of lending pumps money into the economy that would n't be there otherwise so it creates money the banks will either have a cash deficit or surplus at end of each day and either need to borrow from other banks to balance their books or if in surplus lend to other banks to make interest because that 's more profitable than holding the cash surplus the overnight cash rate then determines interest rates we pay     high private debt occurs when lots of people are investing amp buying things so there is stimulation and growth in the economy a lot more tax is being paid in these periods so government debt is lower because they are getting lots of tax money also to stimulate the economy into this growth period the government usually sells off large cash bonds lowering their debt to release cash into the economy the more cash available the less banks have to borrow to cover deficits on overnight cash market and the lower interest rates will be lower interest rates = more borrowing and higher private debt    the government ca n't let growth get out of control as they do n't want high inflation so they do the opposite to slow down growth i.e buy up cash bonds and take money out of economy causing higher interest rates and less borrowing = more debt for government less for private

whether or not uber lyft are taxi services only matters to determine if they need to follow taxi regulations which are meant to protect customers from looking at uber and lyft 's performance however they provide better service at a better price than taxis so what are those regulations actually protecting us from    this is n't about these guys trying to get around the law anymore the business model has been shown to be highly effective and the laws need to be changed to allow for this new model that benefits consumers more than what we had before the hurdle now is that the taxi companies have an interest in keeping the barrier to entry high to prevent competition and that means preventing uber and lyft from getting around those barriers

i think you 've got basics but you may have the order emphasis a bit wrong i 've changed the order of the things you 've learned in to what i think is the most important to understand owning a stock is like owning a tiny chunk of the business owning stock is owning a tiny chunk of the business it 's not just like it the tiny chunks are called shares because that is literally what they are a share of the business sometimes shares are also called stocks the words stock and share are mostly interchangeable but a single stock normally means your holding of many shares in a business so if you have 100 shares in 1 company that 's a stock in that company if you then buy 100 shares in another company you now own 2 stocks an investor seeks to buy stocks at a low price and sell when the price is high not necessarily an investor will buy shares in a company that they believe will make them a profit in general a company will make a profit and distribute some or all of it to shareholders in the form of dividends they will also keep back a portion of the profit to invest in growing the company if the company does grow it will grow in value and your shares will get more valuable price of a stock is affected by supply demand volume and possibly company profits the price of a share that you see on a stock ticker is the price that people on the market have exchanged the share for recently not the price you or i can buy a share for although usually if people on the market are buying and selling at that price someone will buy or sell from you at a similar sort of price in theory the price will be the companies total value if you were to own the whole thing it 's market capitalisation divided by the total number of shares that exist in that company the problem is that it 's very difficult to work out the total value of a company you can start by counting the different things that it owns including things like intellectual property and the knowledge and experience of people who work there subtract all the money it owes in loans etc and then make an allowance for how much profit you expect the company to make in the future the problem is that these numbers are all going to be estimates and different peoples estimates will disagree some people do n't bother to estimate at all the market makers will just follow supply and demand they will hold a few shares in each of many companies that they are interested in they will advertise a lower price that they are willing to buy at and a higher price that they will sell at all the time when they hold a lot of a share they will price it lower so that people buy it from them when they start to run out they will price it higher you will never need to spend more than the market makers price to buy a share or get less than the market makers price when you come to sell it unless you want to buy or sell more shares than they are willing to this is why stock price depends on supply and demand the other category of people who do n't care about the companies they are trading are the high speed traders they just look at information like the past price the volume total amount of shares being exchanged on the market and many other statistics both from the market and elsewhere and look for patterns you can not compete with these people they do things like physically locate their servers nearer to the stock exchanges buildings to get a few milliseconds time advantage over their competitors to buy shares quicker than them

yes that is not an unusual number in some states the state tax rate is fairly flat and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat the big issue is the federal number several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income and the taxes though the net check will get smaller keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer the tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same for those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck the average paycheck for the first part of the year this can put you in a higher bracket than you should be and result in a large refund when you file in the spring   you can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding

in general saving money should be prioritized over extra debt payments every dollar that you spend paying down a debt will decrease the amount of principal owed this will directly decrease the future interest payments you will make however as time goes on you are dealing with a smaller and smaller set of principal additionally it is assumed that your income will grow or at least keep pace with inflation making the debt more on the other hand every dollar you save or invest now will increase your future income also making the future debt more not only that but the longer you save the more value to you get from having saved meaning you should save as early as possible finally the benefits of paying down the mortgage early end when the mortgage is completely paid off while the benefits of saving will continue and even grow after the house is owned free and clear   that is if you have an extra $ 100,000 to put into the mortgage during the life of the loan you could sink that into the mortgage and see it disappear or you could invest it and reap the dividends for the rest of your life caveat emptor behavior trumps numbers this only works if you will actually be disciplined about saving the extra money rather than paying off debt if you 're the kind of person for whom money burns a hole in your pocket until you spend it then use it on debt but if you are able to save and invest that money you will be better off in the long run

is it true that due the to the increase in interest rates that inflation is likely to increase as well it is typically the reverse where inflation causes interest rates to rise interest rates fundamentally reflect the desire for people to purchase future goods over present day goods   if i loan money to someone for 5 years i lose the ability to use that money   in order to entice me to loan the money the borrower would have to offer me an incentive that is they would have to give me additional money at the end of that 5 years   this additional money is the interest rate and it reflects the desire of people to spend money in the future versus the present day   if offered the same amount of money today versus 5 years from now almost everyone would chose to take the money now   money in the present is more valuable than the same amount of money in the future interest rates would still exist even with a currency that could not be printed i would still prefer to have the currency today than in the future if the currency is continually devalued i.e. the issuer is printing more of the currency than borrowers may charge additional interest to compensate for the loss in purchasing power when they make a loan also it is hard to compare interest rates and inflation   inflation is very difficult to calculate new products and services as well as ever changing consumer desires continually change the mixture of goods in the market so it is nearly impossible to compare a basket of goods today to a basket of goods 5 10 20 or 30 years ago

the other answers have offered some great advice but here is an alternative that has n't been mentioned yet i 'm assuming that you have an adequately sized emergency fund in savings and that your cars are your only non mortgage debt since you still have car debt you probably do n't have anything saved for buying a new car when your current cars are at the end of life consider paying off your car loans early then begin saving for your next car having cash in the bank for a car is very freeing and it changes your mindset when it comes time to purchase a car as it is easy to waste a lot of money on something that depreciates rapidly when you are n't paying for it immediately   this approach might be counterintuitive if your car loan interest rate is less than your mortgage rate but you will probably need another car before you need another house and paying cash for a car is worth doing

i am not an expert in this stuff but my understanding is that the debt is in the form of us treasury securities which mature at set rates and are paid at maturation   so technically the us treasury pays off a portion of its debt whenever the debt securities mature   thus if china or any country buys new treasury securities at a slower rate than its currently held treasury securities are maturing the amount of us debt held by china will decrease   this is what i hear china has been doing recently

haha now there 's two of you   i have two parrot in my ears in stereo   okay so maybe you are n't from the us in which case i can forgive your confusion and completely circular logic   you must have gone back to wikipedia or something because the is and lm curves are not in your words operating without control by powerful offices in government   the is and lm curve indeed cross at a level that is consistent with an equilibrium between income and expenditure 's with the money market   but that 's just the label slapped on it it 's not as some sort of naturally occurring law of economics in our society   no these things do n't just happen on their own   if what you 're implying were true then there would be no such thing as an expansionary or monetary policy   manipulating and controlling the money supply is the entire reason for the existence of the federal reserve   what is wrong with you   go read a book or something on it fuck me   the federal reserve by setting interest rates mainly and by open market operations and by less frequently changing the reserve requirements which directly controls the money multiplier you know that thing that creates money out of thin air you seem to not be able to understand exists is constantly changing aggregate demand in the economy   aggregate demand is what the curve is about   it 's about the equilibrium between price levels and the level of economic output demanded   but not supplied   that 's aggregate supply and the federal reserve effects that less   but yes you 've simply expanded the scope of things i could talk about that are fucked up about banks and the fed in particular because the federal reserve in manipulating aggregate demand for money actually is destroying money and the efficient use of money at the same time because the lm curve in particular really represents the relationship between real income and the real money supply   real means not nominal but in actual purchasing terms   the fed is manipulating an lm curve that at its base is a piece of logic built on the assumption that what 's going into it are real numbers and yet by definition the fed acting to manipulate it makes those numbers not determined by purely market forces but also by the fed   that makes them less than real   basically the federal reserve pumps up artificial levels of demand in the economy which lasts for a bit to generate growth numbers but in the long term it simply results in inflation and a continually delayed at least for now reckoning where the artificial demand i.e. the government 's ability to borrow can not be further expanded and something has to give   this down the road would be a monetary crisis involving the us dollar being knocked off its as the world 's primary reserve currency and the yields on treasuries skyrocketing to the point that the government is either forced to behave or else print so much money to actually cover interest payments on the debt that the flood of money into the economy causes catastrophic inflation   but anyway my point is that you 're making a circular argument because you 're saying that the fed does n't interfere in or exert tremendous control over the economy because there 's something that we know shows the given price level of money in an economy called the curve falsely implying that everything 's fine with money because it 's determined by mechanical natural laws almost like gravity when in fact the federal reserve 's whole purpose is to manipulate the inputs that go into that curve   it reduces interest rates which artificially increases income   it also increases the velocity of money an input for the lm curve by increasing nominal economic output etc etc   the is and lm curves are not these things that just sort of happen on their own   this may come as a shock but the us has a central bank which has as its sole purpose the manipulation of these curves   its central mandate is control of price levels   its mandate is to preserve the status of the big banks on the top of society which is why the big banks created it in the first place and why they own all the branches this is the root fact behind why some people say that the federal reserve is in fact not federal and is instead privately owned which is n't completely literally true but true enough in the sense that it has a clear conflict of interest between the public good it 's supposed to be and the private interests of the banks that own its branches and exert control over the financial system mainly through the new york branch but that 's not the whole story about the total money supply   there 's also the effect of the money multiplier   it 's as if you 're just pretending these things do n't exist   it 's real i assure you   banks create money out of thin air when they extend credit to you   to pay the obligation to them you use the real money you in fact earned through your own labor or from some real asset you might have   they get the better end of the deal and almost all the money in the economy is by this process this insanely exorbitant privilege they have   and yes i have a problem with it

consider the futures market traders buy and sell gold futures but very few contracts relatively speaking result in delivery the contracts are sold and open interest to near zero most months as the final date approaches the seller buys back his short position the buyer sells off his longs   when i own a call and am winning say the option that cost me $ 1 is now worth $ 2 i 'd rather sell that option for even $ than to buy 100 shares of a $ stock the punchline is that very few option buyers actually hope to own the stock in the end just like the futures open interest falls as expiration approaches

real estate is a lousy investment because renting a home and buying a home all else being equal are pretty similar in costs in the long term if you can force yourself to invest the would be down payment so buy a home if you want to enjoy the benefits of home ownership buy a home if you need to hedge against rising housing prices e.g. you 're on a fixed income and could n't cope if rent increased a bunch when the economy heated up maybe buy a home if you 're in a high tax bracket to save yourself from being taxed on your imputed rent if it works out that way consult your financial advisor but do n't consider it a really great investment vehicle returns are average and the risk profile is n't that attractive

1 are the definitions for capital market from the two sources the same yes   they are from two different perspectives   investopedia is looking at it primarily from the perspective of a trader and they lead off with the secondary market this refers to the secondary market a market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities this refers to the primary market organizations institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds also the investopedia definition leaves much to be desired but it is supposed to be   so you are comparing apples and oranges to some extent   one is an article as short as it may be this other one is an entry in a dictionary 2 what is the opposite of capital market according to the definition in investopedia   it 's not quite about opposites this is not physics   however that is not the issue here   the investopedia definition simply does not mention any other possibilities   the wikipedia article defines the term more thoroughly   it talks about primary secondary markets in separate paragraph 3 according to the wikipedia 's definition why does stock market belong to capital market given that stocks can be held less than one year too if you follow the link in the wikipedia article to money market as money became a commodity the money market is nowadays a component of the financial markets for assets involved in short term borrowing lending buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less the key here is original maturities of one year or less here 's my attempt at explaining this financial markets are comprised of money markets and capital markets    money is traded as if it were a commodity on the money markets   hence the short term nature in its definition   they are more focused on the money itself      capital markets are focused on the money as a means to an end companies seek money in these markets for longer terms in order to improve their business in some way a business may go to the money markets to access money quickly in order to deal with a short term cash crunch   meanwhile a business may go to the capital markets to seek money in order to expand its business note that capital markets came first and money markets are a relatively recent development    also we are typically speaking about the secondary capital market when we are talking about the stock or bond market   in this market participants are merely trading among themselves   the company that sought money by issuing that stock bond certificate is out of the picture at that point and has its money    so facebook got its money from participants in the primary market the underwriters   the underwriters then turned around and sold that stock in an ipo to the secondary market   after the ipo their stock trades on the secondary market where you or i have access to trade it   that money flows between traders   facebook got its money at the beginning of the process

most of the gold prices at international markets are usd denominated hence the prices would be same in international markets where large players are buying and selling however this does not mean that the prices to the individuals in local markets is same the difference is due to multiple things like cost of physical delivery warehousing local taxation conversion of local currency to usd etc so in essence the price of gold is similar to price of crude oil the price of oil is more or less same on all the markets exchanges though there is small difference this is because of the cost of delivery shipment which is borne by the buyer however the cost of oil to retail individual varies from country to country

your company wants to raise $ for a new project but costs are incurred by issuing securities underwriting legal fees etc first you must determine how much of the $ is going to be debt and equity the company 's target d e ratio is 50 or .50 for every $ 0.50 of debt raised they want to raise $ 1.00 in equity $ 1.00 + $ 0.50 = $ 1.50 $ = 1/3 debt that leaves the equity portion being 2/3 $ 1/3 = $ debt   and $ 2/3 = $ equity using the weighted average cost then you would do something like this = 1/3 + 2/3 = = $ = $

if it is a business loan the borrower would be able to claim a deduction for any interest paid on the loan and the lender would include the interest earned as part of their taxable income you need to be careful on what you do and do n't include as income if the repayments made to you by the borrower in a year is $ 10,000 but only $ 8,000 of that is interest and the other $ 2,000 is part of the principal being returned to the lender then you would only claim $ 8,000 as your income and the borrower would only claim $ 8,000 as a business deduction of course if it is interest only then you and the borrower would use the full $ 10,000

before the internet there were these things called bulletin board system they were usually privately operated the software ran on a single personal computer and most of the time they had 1 phone line connected to them there were thousands of these systems in every state   visitors would call the phone number and connect in a 1 to 1 conversation the user would then be presented with all sorts of menus and interactive experiences usually with colored text the primary feature of any was the forum called a bulletin board at the time but many also had other things file sharing sections games etc basically everything that the larger internet is used for today   possibly the worst thing that happened to the internet was the dot com boom as a result of a tiny few people getting filthy rich it has created a different landscape where large corporations are kings and it 's very difficult for smaller community projects to find the sort of success they would otherwise enjoy   if the internet were not so ruled by media giants like google and facebook you would see a lot more smaller sites and communities similar to the of old they would have more personality and the experience would probably be better   so no soundcloud does n't matter that much soundcloud started as a small website and they deserve to exist as much as anyone but every time a media giant on the internet collapses we see dozens of small startups take it 's place and the result is often better   there is definitely value in having a central repository i wonder if something like soundcloud could exist decentralized a lot of smaller music sites with preview and purchase features that form a sort of meta network

there is no limit on the output maximum in one year the strength of the hsa is that if you do n't spend all the money in the account it rolls over to the next year the benefit is that if a few years down the road you get a huge medical bill you are protected because you can pull it out of the hsa   the goal for me was to build up the account to a level that even if i had to may the maximum out of pocket for my insurance policy the money game from previous years deposits and current year deposits even you ever have the situation where the employer does n't offer a high deductible plan the money for co payments and medicines can still be pulled from the pre existing hsa   if the government did limit you to withdraws not exceeding current year deposits the roll over feature would be worthless

is it common in the us not to pay medical bills or do i misunderstood what had been said there has definitely been a misunderstanding as it is not that common for people to not pay medical bills yes there are those that can not afford to pay them and that does contribute to increasing prices but overall people do pay i think there is an aspect to this that has not been covered by the other two answers what is common at least in my experience is that medical providers i.e. doctors hospitals etc are much more likely to work with you on establishing a payment plan than utilities credit card companies banks etc are this is different than holding off payment in the hopes of negotiating a reduction in payment i am speaking of paying the total amount but over multiple payments and without a penalty for paying over multiple payments and usually they will ask you what you can afford if you can pay $ 50 per month likely that will work and even what i do that and call to pay the monthly amount they will ask if i will pay that or some other including lesser amount also if i skip a month usually from forgetting not intentionally there is again no additional fee this does n't cover all providers but so far has been consistent across all of the ones i have used i suspect this is what your colleagues were referring to

it 's definitely a racket but safety is a pretty good reason to implement regulation and filters on who can be a driver some places have had illegal taxis operating for years which might be fine a lot of the time but can also lead to drivers robbing hurting people this is the thing that taxi drivers keep trying to remind us of while they try to keep their jobs it 's also why a lot of people would be scared to try in fact my previous manager went on a work trip to africa years ago was met at the airport by a taxi driver got driven into the middle of nowhere and robbed at gunpoint similar might have happened to me and my mum after landing in kuala lumpur years ago having a taxi driver offer us his services which we accepted only for him to run away before we got to his car because the airport police saw him and gave chase on sight   do n't forget when you get into a car you are at the mercy of the driver if taxis were just any dude who happens to be in a car then it could easily be a bad guy pretending to be a taxi driver to find victims but if taxis are uniquely marked and drivers have special licenses you at least get some assurance that their main motivation is to provide a taxi service   a key thing that uber changed is making it feel like the drivers and passengers are easily identified by being on the app while making a strong public case for their service making drivers and passengers seem legitimate but imagine getting into strangers cars a few years ago when it was n't common or even easier imagine getting into a strangers car that you did n't book through uber imagine standing at a bus stop and having some dude in a camry pull up and ask if you need a ride or seeing some guy on craigslist advertising himself as a private taxi who does n't want to use uber   if you 're asking why taxis are so expensive everywhere well that 's probably more to do with them being scummy protectionist businesses than anything else but until a few years ago the service that uber and airbnb provide was highly sketchy outside the proper channels

for all stocks expected dividends are a part of the price it is traded for consider that originally the whole idea of stocks was to participate in the earnings of the company = get dividends the day the dividend is paid that expectation is of course removed and thereby the stock value reduced by just the amount of dividend paid you will see that behavior for all stocks everywhere the dividend in your example is just high relative to the stock price but that is a company decision they can decide whatever amount they want as a dividend in other words the day before dividend payments investors value the stock at $ plus an expected dividend payment of 12 $ which adds to 26 $ the day after the dividend payment investors still value the stock at $ plus no more dividend payment = 0 $ nothing changed really in the valuation

it ought to be possible to buy a foreign exchange future aka forex future fx future businesses use these futures to make sure their exchange rate is predictable if they put a bunch of money into manufacturing things that 'll be ready a year later it helps to know that the currency exchange rate shifts wo n't wipe out all their profits if you 're willing to take on some of that risk and if things go your way you can make money they are essentially contracts between two private parties to pay each other a certain amount of money based on the movement of the currencies so the chinese government does n't actually need to be involved and no need to change hands you can just trade the contracts note that the exchange rate is currently fixed by the chinese government so you 're going to be subject to enhanced levels of political risk and they may not be as widely available or readily tradable as other foreign exchange futures so check with a broker before opening your account i could n't find them on my personal etrade account but a quick google search reveals cme group offering some there are probably others   foreign exchange futures are an advanced investing tool and carry risk be sure you understand the risk in particular how much money you can end up on the hook for if things do n't go your way also remember futures expire you 're not just betting on the rate changing but you 're betting on it changing within a certain amount of time

in the us mortgage payments are not deductible what is deductible is the mortgage interest to a limit that as well is not deductible but rather as part of your itemized deductions on schedule a of your yearly tax return so if you 're married and have a standard deduction of $ a year live in a state with no state income tax and your property tax and the mortgage interest are less than your standard deduction you will not be getting any tax benefit whatsoever that is in fact the case for many if not majority of the us mortgage payers so in order to get a proper estimate you need to take into account all the aspects of your tax calculations which are by nature quite personal and simulate the changes with the mortgage interest deduction most tax preparation software will allow you creating multiple files so you can run the numbers for different scenarios

here in the uk the rule of thumb is to keep a lot of equity in your home if you can i assume here that you have a lot of savings you 're considering using if you only have say 10 of the house price you would n't actually have a lot of choice in the matter the mortgage lender will penalise you heavily for low deposits the practical minimum is 5 but for most people a 95 mortgage is just silly albeit not as silly as the 100 or greater mortgages you could get and you should take serious individual advice before considering it according to which the average in the uk for first time buyers is 20 not the best source for that data i confess but a convenient one above 20 is not at all unusual you 'll do an affordability calculation to figure out how much you can borrow which is n't at all the same as how much you should borrow but does get you started basically you decide how much a month you can spend on mortgage payments the calculation will let you put every penny into this if you choose to but in practice you 'll want some discretionary income so do n't do that decide the term of the mortgage for a young first time buyer in the uk i think you 'd typically take a 25-year term and consider early repayment options rather than committing to a shorter term but you do n't have to mortgage lenders will offer shorter terms as long as you can afford the payments decide how much you 're putting into a deposit make for cost of moving stamp duty if applicable fees aka people to your stuff receive back a number which is the house price you can pay under these constraints and of course a breakdown of what the mortgage principle would be and the interest rate you 'll pay this step requires access to lender information since their rates depend on personal details deposit percentage phase of the moon etc our mortgage advisor did multiple runs of the calculation for us for different scenarios since we had n't made up our minds entirely since you have not yet decided how much deposit to make you can use multiple calculations to see the effect of different deposits you might make up to a limit of your total savings putting up more deposit both increases the amount you can borrow for a given monthly payment since mortgage rates are lower when the loan is a lower proportion of house value and of course increases the house price you can afford so unless you 're getting a very high return on your savings £ 1 of deposit gets you somewhat more than £ 1 of house and the calculation will tell you how much more once you 've chosen the house you want the matter is even simpler do you prefer to put your savings in the house and borrow less and make lower payments or prefer to put your savings elsewhere and borrow more and make higher payments but perhaps have some additional income from the savings assuming you maintain a contingency fund a lower mortgage is generally considered a good investment in the uk but you need to check what 's right for you and compare it to other investments you could make the issue is complicated by the fact that residential property prices are rising quite quickly in most areas of the uk and have been for a long time meaning that highly leveraged property investment appears to be a really good idea this leads to the imprudent but tempting conclusion that you should buy the biggest house you can possibly afford and watch its value rises i do not endorse this advice personally but it 's certainly true that in a sharply rising house market it 's easier to get away with buying a bigger house than you need than it is to get away with it in a flat or falling market as stephen says an offset mortgage is a no brainer good idea if the rate is the same unfortunately in the uk the rate is n't the same or anyway it was n't a couple of years ago offset mortgages are especially good for those who make a lot of savings from income and for any reason do n't want to commit all of those savings to a traditional mortgage payment good reasons for not wanting to do that include uncertainty about your future income and a desire to have the flexibility to actually spend some of it if you fancy

on this the best thing you can do is ask current analysts for help you 're new and people expect you to ask dumb questions at this point so ask them now while you still get a pass   with that being said there 's a strategy to it before you ever ask a question spend at least 5 minutes trying to figure out the answer on your own op did a google search which is great so many people wo n't do this finally the way you ask the question is key i would go to an analyst and say boss asked me to get a list of all us apartment flooring companies i looked on google to see if i could find anything there if you were doing this where would you go to find the information   they 'll usually even walk you through how to do it if there 's something special with the service you have for the task you 'll also make them feel important and you 'll get the task done fast   also if you run into trouble with the boss after presenting it you can always back yourself up by saying you asked around the office for what tool to use and people told you to use that but be strategic with how you say it because you do n't want to throw anyone under the bus

this is second hand information as i am not a millionaire but i work with such people everyday and have an understanding of how they handle cash the wealthy people do n't simple definitely not if they do n't have to cash is a tool to them that they use only if they get benefit of it being a cash transaction one of my friends is a re seller and he gets a 10 discount from suppliers for settling lines using cash everything else they place on a line of credit for people who dislike credit cards and pay using atm or debit cards might actually have a very poor understanding of leverage i assure you the wealthy people have a very good understanding of it frankly wealthy people pay less for everything but they deserve it because of the extreme amount of leverage they have built for themselves their aprs are low their credit limits are insanely high they have longer billing periods and they get spoiled by credit card vendors all the time for example when you buy your groceries at walmart you pay at least a 4 markup because that 's the standardized cost of processing credit cards even if you paid in cash a wealthy person uses his credit card to pay for the same but earns the same percentage amount in cash back points and what not i am sure littleadv placed the car purchase on his credit card for similar reasons the even more wealthy have their groceries shipped to their houses and if they pay cash i wo n't be surprised if they actually end up paying much less for fresh organic vegetables than what equivalent produce at walmart would get them i apologize for not being able to provide citations for these points i make as they are personal observations

bernie sources   gt heading out to open land to make your society in your image would definitely prove your point as long as it works   and do that how buy my own island sea and hope the us military does n't just drop a seal team on my head   gt;we just have plenty of evidence that no government is less so   no we really have evidence that structure is better than nothing i 'm not advocating for no structure businesses charities organizations etc obviously work better when they are well structured   to answer your enron example no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they did n't have at least partial backing by the government    you know the drill big business buy politicians contributions politicians write big business laws anti competitive to push small guys out then when big business needs additional help politicians come in to save the day bailouts   the market would be extremely more competitive if for example the dodd frank act which to my understanding the repeal just recently passed the house went away it has been community banks just like glass did it essentially only allowed the big banks to compete surprise they did some stupid things great recession but if you do n't think they did n't already know that they those bailouts were coming if needed you are fooling yourself   these messages are almost getting to the point of tldr   i want to simplify our debate a bit   the crux of my whole belief is this the only way for a government to spend their citizens money in a better way than the citizens could would be if the government knew the utility of every single citizen it is absolutely impossible to do that the only people that truly know their own utility from something is them self    from here on i would like to debate the headlines like what i wrote above and not necessarily bullet points we can every now and then but i find that we then start working on tangents of tangents of tangents and can get a little messy   however i do not want to leave the current stones with your response   i would say that if it was privatized you are not going to have scope creep at least not to the same extent say we have the la militia that is wanting to help protect their ports they want to help develop a new boat that is fast and can help maneuver around big ships quickly like a better version of the new mark patrol boat   that money is their money directly or the peoples money who they 've asked to voluntarily give their money up to help protect their area   if they screw up and start asking for above necessary stuff or pick a developer who wastes their money etc they are going to lose business they will stop getting donations lose profit etc   however the government does n't have that why because their revenue donations are n't voluntary there really is n't accountability especially in bureaucracy    to the exchange stock problem i would say that exchanges are private businesses too they should have full reign on whether they allow trades if they believe that there is an unnecessary selloff because of a fake tweet saying that president has been shot they can stop that if fact it would be in there best interest to do so because it could limit unnecessary investor losses   it is unfortunate that the whole world is covered with governments i wish there was another western to populate and try new ways with   however i would say that there is a clear shift away from government is society   a few examples the driverless car elderly people and people who are disabled will be able to rely on the government less for transportation additionally assuming everyone will eventually have a driverless car there will be much less demand for traffic cops etc   cryptocurrency as there are now more and more businesses that stop accepting cash mainly starting with change there will naturally be less robbers because there is no money to steal you could make the argument that there will be an increase in cyber theft which i agree but not on a 1:1 ratio of the decrease in physical this decrease will help also lessen the demand for police officers   package delivery if it was n't for the post office their ability to deliver letters and using they would have gone broke a long time ago imagine amazon dhl ups fedex etc all competing to deliver you letter i 'm assuming that it would be less than the cost of a current stamp and with a lot more assurance that it will actually get to its destination   those are just a few examples

as @littleadv 's comment on your question said it is unlikely that you and your husband paid a total of $ 5 k in income tax on $ 185 k of wages in 2013 more likely your 2013 tax return assumed to be a married filing jointly tax return showed that you had not arranged to have   enough tax withheld from your salaries and thus you still owed $ 5 k   to the irs for 2013 taxes most likely that $ 5 k sum included not just the unpaid amount of tax but also   penalties for not paying enough income tax during 2013 and interest on the amounts not paid on time   just to be clear note that the income tax you paid for 2013 during 2013 is the total of all income tax withheld from your wages by your employers plus any estimated tax payments that you might have made for 2013 if your 2014 tax return that you will be filing by april 15 2015   will likely show a similar amount due for 2014 taxes you can avoid   the penalties and interest by increasing   your income tax withholding by a substantial amount for the remainder of 2014 if you are paid monthly and have two paychecks still to be received then having $ 2500 extra withheld from each paycheck will cover the $ 5 k shortfall that you expect to have for 2014 taxes i assume that this is what your husband intended you to do and to do   this you need to fill out a new w-4 form asking that an   $ 2500 be withheld from each paycheck and give this form to your employer soon i.e. well before payroll processes your next paycheck which usually happens a few days before you get the paycheck   if you do so your take home pay will be reduced by $ 2500 on each of the next two monthly paychecks because your employer will withhold this extra amount from your pay and include it in the amount sent to the irs as income tax withheld from your paycheck after your last paycheck for 2014 has been received you should submit a new w-4 form to your asking for only $ in extra income tax to be withheld from each paycheck starting january 1 2015 so that   the expected $ 5 k shortfall for 2015 is paid in 12 equal monthly installments if you neglect to do this your employer will continue to withhold $ 2500 extra as income tax and you will get $ 2500 less in take home pay month after month in 2015 this money will not disappear forever come 2016 when you file your income tax return for 2015 you will receive a substantial refund because you overpaid income tax by a lot during 2015 you will not however receive any interest on the amount that the irs is returning to you unless the irs delays in sending you the refund for some reason   alternatively you can file a new w-4 asking for no additional tax to be withheld from 2015 paychecks and a year from now go through the same exercise as above have $ 2500 extra withheld from the last two paychecks for 2015 right when the holidays are coming and people are shopping for gifts

one of the things i have enjoyed about consulting is the exposure to multiple companies and multiple business units within those companies in the year i have been at the group i have already worked with multiple clients on projects that span across the respective organizations it has been very interesting to contrast the clients and more specifically the corporate cultures that exist within those companies   i have participated in and watched various projects being driven in different parts of a client 's business and it is interesting to see which projects have been are and will be successful the other day i was reading a report of some analysis done by one of the world 's largest and most respected consulting firms the analysis was essentially outlining a path for success for a broad spectrum of projects of varied and complexities the analysis which was very good by the way touched on a lot of elements of the business that would impact the likelihood of project success elements like governance data analysis process design etc the analysis and the accompanying recommendations were undoubtedly sound given the caliber of the firm the background research done to support the report and my own confirmation based on what i have picked up about the client i try and get my hands on these types of reports whenever possible to see how the big boys are doing it to shape my own thinking and to have examples of successful presentations i am however always surprised that these reports fail to mention what i consider to be a very big influence on the success of a project and ultimately the success of the organization as a whole   at their core companies are merely people a group of people with a collective identity a corporate culture if you will reflecting back on my many interactions with the people that make up these organizations it has become very evident to me that a collaborative corporate culture is a huge in determining the success of any project although it is a macro factor the collaborative spirit of an organization everything that the company does and/or attempts to do   here is an example to give context of the premise i am talking about   at client a the project team i worked with was designing an extremely innovative complex and challenging system that has the potential to alter the way they do business without going into too much detail it was a massive undertaking with relatively limited   at client b the scope of work i was involved in was relatively straightforward and mirrored business practices at other organizations the bulk of the effort on my part was driving the creation and adoption of a framework to promote cross functional interaction amongst project teams a very realistic undertaking with appropriate   below are that illustrate typical exchanges in both organizations in both organizations i have been directed to connect with a particular individual or group of individuals as it was thought that our respective works may be related in some fashion   client a me let me give you a brief overview of the project i am working on john doe recommended i connect with you as your project may with mine in some manner we may be able to help each other continue with my overview   other party wow this is great i actually have really in depth knowledge of x and would love to get involved in the work you are doing i am actually simultaneously driving y effort and it would be great if we were aligned at a high level we are both supporting strategy a so connecting now would really set us up for success feel free to include me on your future meetings and i will pass along our high level overview also have you thought about connecting with so and so they are working in the z space on a project and it may help to drive your project forward as well   client b me let me give you a brief overview of the project i am working on john doe recommended i connect with you as your project may    other party well we have already gotten our project approved at such and such level and we have found that we really do n't have any with your project   me oh ok well i am not really looking to create additional work for anyone i am just looking to leverage the work we are both already doing we may be able to help each other    other party again our project team is really busy and we are on a tight deadline we do n't have the resources we need i have told john doe time and again we need more help but until we get it i just really need to focus on x.   me ok well how about i jump in to what it is we are actually doing and if there are n't any opportunities for collaboration or any synergies to be gained from working together that is fine i just wanted to be proactive about connecting the dots across the organization continue with my overview   other party meeting concludes   these are n't of a single event they are of month 's of interactions that give a good representation of single events in a variety of contexts on a daily basis of course there are exceptions however i have found that exceptions within both cultures are extremely rare based on my personal experience this only my point can you begin to see why a collaborative corporate culture is so foundational to the success of any endeavor regardless of scope complexity etc   the other aspect that adds to the importance of a sound corporate culture is the self fulfilling nature of culture which organization do you think future collaborative behavior even those people that want to collaborate within client b are consistently met with resistance those in client a are inspired by the positive interactions enhanced results and they are more likely to actively seek out others to help and work with both are accelerated in opposite directions just by the nature of the prevailing culture   so how do you create and a culture that collaboration that my friends is a question i do n't pretend to have all the answers too maybe i 'll be so lucky to figure that one out someday

right that 's what i was implying words meant as well   i felt like his words were a justification for amazons crazy high p e ratio compared to its competitors   because it has the potential to be a monopoly in the future    the author on the other hand was implying that amazon is currently a monopoly which is simply not true

start up and operating costs in a credit union notes in part given the significant costs involved most groups seek grant money and    non member deposits if pre approved for the low income designation    to help subsidize the pre costs and annual operating    expenses thus in forming the union there would be the money from members and possible grants to ensure completion of the process which is how one starts a cu in the us

i know i came a little late to this discussion but let me give you my opinion i think that purchasing the bmw is a terrible investment for obvious reasons once you drive the car off the dealer 's lot the car loses anywhere from 5 10k in value immediately its a terrible investment and something that you will regret in the future however whether you buy it now or you hold off we all know you are eventually still going to get it i graduated college and was in a similar situation as the one you are now i started making 60k after college and leased a brand new bmw like i said it was a terrible investment but i do not regret it for one day i ve had so much fun in that car that i ca n't even begin to explain we only live once and you do n't want to be one of those guys that looks back and says i should 've this i should 've that just do it we all know it wo n't be possible when you have a wife and kids so just splurge now and be responsible later lol

all life insurance is pretty much the same when it comes to cost you can run the numbers over certain time period and the actual cost of insurance is about the same a simplified way to explain life insurance and the differences between them below the 3 characteristics of life insurance there are 5 popular types of life insurance and they are term whole life universal life variable universal life indexed universal life but first one must understand the most basic life insurance which is called annual renewable term   this is a policy that covers 1 year and is renewable every year after the cost of insurance typically increases each year as the insured ages so for every year of coverage your premium increases like in the simplified illustration above this is the building block of all life insurance term or permanent there is no cash value all premium goes to the cost of insurance   this is an art that spans over a longer time period than 1 year say 5 10 15 20 or 30 years all the cost is added together then divided by the number of years of coverage to give a level premium payment for the duration of the policy the longest coverage offered these days is 30 years there is no cash value all premium goes to the cost of insurance the premium is fixed level for the term specified if the policy comes to an end and the owner wishes to renew it it will be at higher premium this can be seen in the simplified illustration above for a 15-year term policy   because life insurance gets very expensive as you reach old age life insurance companies came up with a way to make it affordable for the consumer wishing to have coverage for their entire lifespan they allow you to have interest rate crediting on the cash value account inside the policy   to have cash value in the first place you must pay premiums that are more than the cost of insurance the idea is your cash value grows over time to help pay for the cost of insurance in the later stages of the policy where the cost of insurance is typically higher this is illustrated above in an overly simplified way this is a permanent life insurance policy that is designed to cover the lifespan of the insured there is cash value that is credited on a fixed interest rate specified by the insurance company typically 3 5 the premium is fixed for the life of the policy it was designed for insuring the entire lifespan of the insured this is variation of whole life there is cash value it is credited on a fixed interest rate specified by the insurance company but it does fluctuate year to year depending on the economy typically 3 6 the premium is flexible you can increase decrease the premium   this is basically a universal life policy but the cash value sits in an account that is invested in the market normally mutual funds your interest that is being credited to your account with your cash value from investments is subjected to risk in the market rise fall with the market depending on the portfolio of your choosing hence the word variable you take on the risk instead of the insurance company it can be a very good product if the owner knows how to manage it just like any other investment products this is a hybrid of the and the the interest rate depends on the performance of a market index or a set of market indices the insurance company states a maximum interest rate or cap you can earn up to and a guaranteed minimum floor on your cash value interest that will be credited typically 0 floor and 12 cap it is purely a method to credit you interest rate it takes the market risk out of the equation but still retains some of the growth potential of the market term policy is designed for temporary coverage there is no cash value accumulation permanent policies such as whole life universal life variable universal life and indexed universal life have a cash value accumulation component that was originally designed to help pay for the cost of insurance in the later stages of the policy when the insured is at an advanced age so it can cover the entire lifespan of the insured people do take advantage of that cash value component and its tax advantages for retirement income supplement and maximize the premium contribution always remember that life insurance is a life insurance product and not an investment vehicle there is a cost of insurance that you are paying for but if you have life insurance needs you might as well take advantage of the cash value accumulation deferred tax growth and tax free access that these permanent policies offer

that 's false i 'm not morally outraged by anything businesses do because they 're not meant to be moral i do n't like it because it does n't work and this policy wo n't work    secondly trickle down economics is a theory that says benefits for the wealthy will help everyone else that 's in my text books it 's usually in the form of tax cuts but can come in other benefits    it 's a safe assumption to assume that tech firms are run by wealthy people this benefits no one but the wealthy that run firms   unless you want to define any policy that helps business as trickle down this is false the article clearly states this is benefit is being done for the betterment of idaho 's tech hub   because it provides so much for the state   what 's the difference between that and saying we 're giving tax breaks to the largest corporations because the provide so much for the state    none firms save money to benefit the state while only benefitting themselves in both scenarios    it benefits idaho business which long term will hurt idaho just like supply side economics benefits businesses but hurts the county long term    economic benefits are more than taxes and gains especially when they 're so closely related to jobs mobility and expenses saved based on reducing mobility and forcing people to stay in the same jobs    help us keep our people here help us be able to pay them less to live in a shit state because us having top notch human capital is best   for society it 's an identical thought train as help us be able to pay workers less than minimum wage because us having capital is what 's best for society   you are considering   the interest of firms for economic benefit even though long term it wo n't benefit you sounds like the thought train of reagan and bush jr. who both trashed the economy    it 's come in benefits such as eased restrictions lack of competition and lack punishment for lack of competition and higher barriers to entry    who does this benefit for the sake of the common man lmao the wealthy owners of firms with high level employees

there is a service transferwise through which you can send money from uk banks to eur bank accounts in the eu for a 1 gbp fee much cheaper then about 25 gbp for a swift transfer you send them a uk national gbp transfer to their uk hsbc account and they send the equivalent amount in eur from their irish eur bank account to your eur account for example in germany what is best is that they use bare mid market forex exchange rates without any markup on the gbp to eur exchange rate which is usually in the range of 2 to 5 in banks so you do n't lose anything on the exchange rate

that is where i think walmart comes in to buy up a business like this with their network of stores and the insane buying power they have the can push a good solid quality that the middle class american wants and do it very cheaply i feel this will be their main combat against amazon buying whole foods currently walmart makes more on grocery sales than anything else as a hole and will continue to do so because of what and how they are doing it walmart is sneaky as fuck when it comes to what they can do and how they can do it even walmart buying up advanced auto parts is a solid counter move to amazon buying whole foods the next step is buying a blue apron type business and with how blue apron is doing financially and given their name they are entering buy off territory   in my humble albeit non pro status in the stock market my 3 buys are snap chat gopro and walmart for long term retire and never have to worry about money again companies i am by no means an expert but i have never come close to losing money in the stock market and do a good amount of research before i invest snapchat is my top 1 tbh sorry for going on a tangent lol

navigating in windows takes way too many clicks find a way for me to get to what i want without digging and holding my mouse over things and then you 'll help me realize my full potential   i 'm not going to learn to customize anything either so develop your solution around that get the user what he she wants without them having to explicitly tell you exact details   maybe you turn on something that watches how i interact and what programs i use maybe there 's an app store in the os that only sets up what i 've selected maybe millions of ideas but solve that problem and you 'll have a happier user   build the machine around the user 's style dont force the user to make the machine work for them   edit i do n't have a mac so i do n't know if that 's how they work but i did just get the iphone 5 from an android and god damn that 's the way a device should function it 's built around how i use the phone and i do n't have to figure anything out or force it to work for me it just works even after rooting and various tools the android was still something that worked against me rather than for me

if you do n't have a good knowledge of finance maybe you should not put too much money in individual stocks but if you really want to invest you can just compare the rate of return of the most known stocks available to you like the one from the s&p for the us the rate of return is very simple to compute it 's share price for example a company with a current share price of usd that delivered a dividend of usd last year would have a rate of return of 100 now if you only invest in the most known stocks since they are already covered by nearly all financial institutions and analysts if you are looking for lower risk dividend companies take a sample of companies and invest those with the lowest rates of return but avoid extreme values of course since the stock prices are changing all the time you have to compare them with a price taken at the same time like the closing price of a specific day and for the dividend they can be on several basis yearly etc so you have to be sure to take the same basis you can also find the p e ratio which is the opposite indicator (= share price dividend so an higher p e ratio means a lower risk most of the time you can find the p e ratio or the rate of return already computed on specialized website or brokers

this probably is a question that belongs on history but here 's the basic reason the or employee retirement income security act erisa of 1974 established that health benefits under approved plans were not taxable to the employee   if the employer were to pay for an employees non erisa approved individual plan it would be a taxable benefit the longer story is that many esp president richard nixon were concerned that public pressure was going to lead public sentiment toward nationalized health care   this made health insurance more affordable to employees and effectively made it a cheaper way to compensate employees similar to how 401 k contributions are worth more in nominal terms to the employee than an equivalent amount of cash   while the law was not signed by richard nixon due to some other stuff that was going on it was something proposed and pushed by his administration

i can answer scenario 3 if you are purchasing a property with buy to let intentions can you use the    rental income exclusively to fund the mortgage repayments yes this is exactly how buy to let mortgage applications are evaluated lenders generally expect you to fund the mortgage payments with rent they look for the anticipated monthly rent income to cover a minimum of 125 of the monthly mortgage payment this is to make sure you can allow for vacant periods maintenance compliance with rules and regulations and still be in profit i.e. generate a positive yield on your investment however buy to let btl mortgage lenders also generally expect you to own your own home to begin with it 's up to them but rare is the lender who will provide a buy to let mortgage to a non owner this is because of point 2 above the lender does n't want you to end up living in the property because then you 'll need to repay the loan capital since you 'll always need somewhere to live this makes the economics of btl they look at your application as a business proposal quite different to a residential mortgage application which is what your question seems to be addressing bottom line you 're right about scenario 3 but it sounds like you 're trying to afford a home first whereas btl is best viewed as an investment for someone who already has their main residence under ownership mortgaged or otherwise as for scenarios 1 and 2 i ca n't offer first hand answers but i think m. and steve have covered it

stuff i wish i had known based on having done the following obtained employment at a startup that grants incentive stock options isos   early exercised a portion of my options when fair market value was very close to my strike price to minimize amt made a section election and paid my amt up front for that tax year all this the exercise and the amt was done out of pocket i 've never see equityzen or mention anything about loans for your exercise my understanding is they help you sell your shares once you actually own them stayed at said startup long enough to have my exercised portion of these isos vest and count as long term capital gains   tried to sell them on both equityzen and with no success due to not meeting their transaction minimums   initial contact with equityzen was very friendly and helpful and i even got a notice about a potential sale but then they hired an intern to answer emails and i remember his responses being particularly dismissive as if i was wasting their time by trying to sell such a small amount of stock so that did n't go anywhere was a little more friendly and was open to the option of pooling shares with other employees to make a sale in order to meet their minimum but that never happened either   my advice if you 're thinking about exercising and you 're worried about liquidity on the secondary markets would be to find out what the minimums would be for your specific company on these platforms before you any cash down eventually brought my request for liquidity back to the company who helped connect me with an interested external buyer and we completed the transaction that way as for employer approval there 's really no reason or basis that your company would n't allow it if you paid to exercise then the shares are yours to sell though the company may have a right of first refusal it 's not really in the company 's best interest to have their shares be illiquid on the secondary markets since that sends a bad signal to potential investors and future employees

basically any time someone claims they put money into your bank account or send you a check or something similar and then asks you to send money to someone else it is a scam what you need to do 1 under no circumstances whatsoever must you ever send money to anyone 2 talk to your bank and ask them for advice   the money that gets put into your bank account is n't real it has been paid with a forged check or a stolen credit card number or a hacked or faked bank account your bank will figure this out eventually and then they will take that money away it may take many weeks but the money will disappear   meanwhile any money that you send to someone is real it 's your money when you send it it is gone your bank will hold you to that   so in your case if they say they pay you $ 6,000 for a job but put $ 10,000 into your bank account and ask you to pass $ 4,000 on to someone the $ 4,000 you pay comes out of your bank account a long time later the $ 10,000 comes out of your bank account and you owe the bank $ 4,000 plus sometimes the job involves real work that obviously does n't pay   an alternative is that this is money laundering in which case you would become a criminal by being involved
