no your business can not deduct your non business expenses   you can only deduct from your business income those reasonable expenses you paid in order to earn income for the business moreover for there to be a tax benefit your business generally has to have income but i expect there are exceptions hst input tax credits come to mind the employment income from your full time job would n't count as business income for your corporation the corporation has nothing to do with that income it 's earned personally by you with respect to restaurant bills these fall under a category known as meals entertainment   even if the expense can be considered reasonable and business related e.g. meeting customers or vendors the canada revenue agency decided that a business can only deduct half of those kinds of expenses for tax purposes with respect to gasoline bills you would need to keep a mileage and expense log only the portion of your automobile expenses that relate to the business can be deducted   driving to and from your full time job does n't count of course i 'm not a tax professional   if you 're going to have a corporation or side business you ought to consult with a tax professional a point on terminology a business does n't write off eligible business expenses it deducts them from business income   write off is an accounting term meaning to reduce the value of an asset to zero e.g. if you damaged your car beyond repair one could say the car is a write off

no bank of america helped out during the financial crisis by buying merrill lynch i am not suggesting they did this for altruistic reasons just trying to describe the position they were in despite already purchasing countrywide they were forced to accept tarp but they paid it all back by the end of 2009 if the irs fucked up their math like bofa is suggesting then they deserve to be compensated   edit countrywide is one word

a $ 100 k house and $ 100 k are not equivalent assets here 's a hypothetical you and i both work for the same company and both get a $ 100 k bonus yes i said it 's hypothetical you decide to use the $ 100 k to pay off your house i put the money in the bank six months later our company lays both of us off i have $ 100 k in the bank i can last for quite a while with that much money in the bank you have a house but you ca n't get a mortgage or home equity loan because you do n't have a job the only way you can access the money is by selling the house which requires you to pay money to a real estate agent and perhaps taxes and leaves you looking for a place to live that assumes there is n't something systemic going on like the credit crash and there is credit available for somebody else to buy your house

i 'm not hating on anyone just agreeing that it 's pretty much all older people or all younger people and not many in between not any one person 's fault just where human nature got us    although i think that they the vocal majority of my generation think that once the boomers retire when the government finally gets filled with people from our generation and once we take over the large corporations that things will get better for us which is the reason for out    i just think we have a load of problems that need to be fixed and it seems like all we ever do is patch them up because the long term fixes are too costly in the short term and that this cycle wo n't ever change but look on the bright side every generation will have a group they can blame and a group to be afraid of so nothing will be anyone 's fault at least until it finally is and someone ends up paying the   hell it 's not like i 've experienced the good times this is what i grew up in so i do n't really know any better my generation does n't expect to stay with the same company for their entire lives because we do n't think it 's possible we 've learned to adapt we 've had to the smarter of us know to learn from your generations mistakes like saving for retirement

cue the wall o text   so here ya go i 'm the son of a commercial industrial plumber who has been in the business for the past 28 years and does yr in sales first of all you need to determine your target market if he 's planning on primarily doing residential work i.e. fixing toilets drains et cetera he may want to re think things residential plumbers are typically not very well paid nor are they really well liked people assume that you 're automatically an idiot or that you are trying to screw them in regards to your pricing commercial and industrial plumbing is where any money is at if he does n't want to have a crew of 30 50 plumbers on call 24/7 including holidays and weekends    if he 's interested in making a lot of money he 's got to first determine if he wants to be an open or closed shop union status having a unionized company can sometimes grant you the ability to be awarded specific contracts for governmental bids on various buildings and schools but these contracts are typically pretty difficult to get also even if you do get the job you 're contractually obligated to use only unionized labor on the project which can be to your benefit or to your detriment depending on the worker they send you the other issue is that if you go for these types of contracts there are plenty of other companies that you 'll be competing against that have been in the business a long time and who already have pretty well set up contacts for receiving that type of work also as an aside your truck putting a on the side or anything more than your plumbing license number is typically union only this act typically unionized companies from non union companies    next he must decide what area of plumbing he wants to specialize in there is process plumbing fire medical gas piping et cetera that he can choose to do that can focus his company into more of a niche market granting him more work and higher prices for his work this is your cash cow milk that bitch for all its worth    as far as getting leads for work you 're going to want to sign up for blue book for construction leads this may seem like a lot of money a few hundred a month or so but the leads it provides you with in terms of bidding for work is invaluable if you want you can set up a website but honestly i would say that it is n't worth your time in this field we 've had a website for a few years and get hits month on it even with google adwords just because this is not the type of industry where people at least commercial and industrial owners go to in order to find their subcontractors also sign up with the subcontractor 's association in your area they provide you with leads and refer you out to other members and can provide you with new business on a regular basis     you 're going to want to keep track of everything larger jobs are best kept in 4 6 where they are off via tabs for quick reference this will assist in keeping the jobs straight keeping plans together correspondence quotes materials hours and everything else it 's taken us years to figure out a good method and this has been the best one we 've come up with to this point typically if a job is then it gets its own otherwise it just gets a typical file folder    one thing to also keep in mind as you grow is to keep your shop as locked up as humanly possible you may think that joe from down the street will be the one who is most likely to steal from you but you 'd be dead wrong it 's your employees tools have a way of walking out of your shop and getting lost on job sites or just simply are not returned and it can get out of hand very quickly a camera system is a very very good investment for this purpose    and since i 'm dead tired at this point i 'm going to leave this for now but i 'll be back to edit it to add in some more points if you 're interested

afaik they use entirely different lte frequencies in japan and the us hence the issues with the new ipad being lte in the states but not here     additionally there are still japanese manufacturers who are big brands in the japanese market but more or less unheard of overseas   so there 's likely to be relatively limited scope for economies of scale regarding handsets   sure with a limited number of handsets e.g. the iphone you may be able to place a larger order but when was the last time you heard of a network operator dictating terms to apple   that 's why only softbank had the iphone at launch because they were the only one willing to cede to apple 's high pricing demands     and that 's before you even get into language related issues   as far as lte equipment goes it depends on suppliers and whether the of ordering equipment for two very different territories thousands of miles apart with very different geography will bear a lot of fruit   as for people traveling between japan and the states its such a tiny proportion of customers it would barely make a dent   and most corporate customers historically favor anyway and given japanese business culture are unlikely to change any time soon   in a nutshell the synergies may not be as strong as it first seems

i think you 've confused what i am saying here as are others i 'm not making an argument where i say either private insurance vs. government management vs. single payer is best because to me you are just arguing whether its more effective to shovel coal wood or up paper into the fires of cost inflation    the systems in the us and all other oecd nations are actual quite similar despite the semantic hair splitting of partisans with aca our system is quite indistinguishable from that of the netherlands my point is that none of these systems costs therefor none of them solve the core problem   to put my point another way as long as you fund health care through a financial product like insurance whether it be public of private you are going to see this level of inflation just like we saw in housing prior to the sub prime bubble and just like we are seeing now with college tuition

another way to look at this is that pure insider trading is an activity with the aim to use secret information to make personal profit or let others make personal profit at the expense of the company shareholders or investors in buybacks it is not company managers to get personal gain in this would be insider trading the end winners in this case are the shareholders so there is nothing inherently bad in buying back stock moreover it is a general practice to buy shares back as opposed to paying dividends when the company sees its shares being undervalued of course provided that it has the cash borrowing ability to implement this since it creates shareholders value thereby maximising shareholder wealth which is one of the primary tasks of the company managers

i 've spent enough time researching this question where i feel   comfortable enough providing an answer   i 'll start with the high level fundamentals and work my way down to the specific question that i had so point 5 is really the starting point for my answer we want to find companies that are investing their money   a good company should be reinvesting most of its excess assets so that it can make more money off of them if a company has too much working capital then it is not being efficiently reinvested   that explains why excess working capital can have a negative impact on return on capital but what about the fact that current liabilities in excess of current assets has a positive impact on the return on capital calculation   that is a problem period   if current liabilities exceed current assets then the company may have a hard time meeting their short term financial obligations this could mean borrowing more money or it could mean something worse like bankruptcy   if the company borrows money then it will have to repay it in the future at higher costs   this approach could be fine if the company can invest money at a rate of return exceeding the cost of their debt but to favor debt in the return on capital calculation is wrong that scenario would skew the metric the company has to overcome this debt anyways this is my understanding as the amateur investor my credibility is not even comparable to greenblatt 's credibility so i have no business calling any part of his calculation wrong but in defense of my explanation greenblatt does n't get into these gritty details so i do n't know that he allowed current liabilities in excess of current assets to have a positive impact on his return on capital calculation

i do n't know that this can actually be answered objectively   maybe it can with some serious research   read data on what the issuers have been doing since the law went into affect personally i think the weak economy and general problems with easy credit are a bigger issue than the new rules   supposedly there is evidence that card issuers are trying to make up for the lost income due to the new regulations with higher fees   i believe that your credit rating and history with the issuer is a larger factor now   in other words they may be less likely to lower your rate just to keep you as a customer or to attract new customers according to the motley fool issuers dropped their riskiest customers as a result of the new regulations some say that new laws simply motivated the issuers to find new ways to gouge their customers here are two nytimes blog posts about the act as johnfx states it does not hurt to ask

no you probably do not need to file a tax return if you received no income and if you meet a number of other criteria the below is copied and pasted slightly edited from the cra you must file a return for 2014 if any of the following situations    apply you have to pay tax for 2014 we sent you a request to file a return you and your spouse or common law partner elected to split pension    income for 2014 see lines 115 116 129 and 210 you received working income tax benefit advance payments in    2014 you disposed of capital property in 2014 for example if you sold    real estate or shares or you realized a taxable capital gain for    example if a mutual fund or trust attributed amounts to you or you    are reporting a capital gains reserve you claimed on your 2013    return you have to repay any of your old age security or employment insurance    benefits see line 235 you have not repaid all amounts withdrawn from your registered    retirement savings plan rrsp under the home plan or the    lifelong learning plan for more information go to home buyers plan    hbp or see guide lifelong learning plan llp or you have to    contribute to the canada pension plan cpp this can apply if for    2014 the total of your net self employment income and    employment income is more than $ 3,500 see line you are paying employment insurance premiums on self employment and    other eligible earnings see lines and 430 in general you will want to file a tax return even if none of the above applies you could for example claim a gst hst credit even with no income now if you receive any income at all you are going to have to pay taxes which means you are obligated to file a tax return if sufficient taxes were deducted from your paycheque you are still obligated to file a tax return however you will not have to pay penalties if you file late even if you file very late at least not until the cra sends you a request to file but be aware you wo n't likely be able to tell if you owe the cra money until you do your taxes and if you do end up owing there are substantial penalties for filing late in general i 'd strongly advise filing your tax return in almost all circumstances

you are young and therefore have a very long time horizon for investing absolutely nothing you do should involve paying any attention to your investments more than once a year if that first off you can only deposit money in an ira of whatever kind if you have taxable income if you do n't you can still invest just without the tax benefits of a roth my suggestion would be to open an account with a discount brokerage schwab fidelity etrade etc the advantage of a brokerage ira is that you can invest in whatever you want within the account then either buy an s&p 500 or total market index fund within the account or buy an index based etf like a mutual fund but trades like a stock the latter might be better since many mutual funds have minimum limits which etfs do not set the account up to reinvest the dividends automatically s&p 500 yields will far outstrip current savings account yields and sit back and do nothing for the next 40 or 50 years well except for continuing to make annual contributions to the account which you should continue to invest in pretty much the same thing until you have enough money and experience and knowledge to diversify into bond funds international funds individual stocks etc disclaimer i am not a financial planner i just manage my own money and this strategy has mostly kept me from stressing too badly over the last few years of market turmoil

i am not an accountant but i have a light accounting background despite being primarily an engineer   i also have a tiny schedule c business which has both better and worse years   i am also in the united states and pay us taxes   i assume you are referring to the us form 1040 tax return with the attached schedule c.   however little i know about us taxes i know nothing about foreign taxes you are a cash basis taxpayer so the transactions that happen in each tax year are based on the cash paid and cash received in that year   you were paid last year you computed your schedule c based on last year 's actual transactions and you paid taxes on that income you can not last years schedule c based on the warranty claim you might want to switch to an accrual accounting method where you can book allowances for warranty claims   it is more complex and if your business is spotty and low volume it may be more trouble than it is worth at this point you have two months to look for ways to shift expenses into next year or being income into this year both of which help offset this loss perhaps a really aggressive accountant would advise otherwise and remember i am not an accountant but i would take the and move on this article on legalzoom link here discusses how to apply a significant net operating loss nol in this year to the previous two years and potentially carry it forward to the next two years   this does involve filing amended returns for the prior two years showing this year 's nol   for this to be relevant your schedule c loss this year must exceed your other w2 and self employment income this year with other tests also applied perhaps a really aggressive accountant would advise otherwise and remember i am not an accountant but i would take the and move on

i know this is heresy but if you have funds for significantly more    than 6 months of expenses let 's say 12 months how risky would it be    to put it all into stock index funds quite risky as if you do need to dip into it how fast could you get the cash also do you realize the tax implications when you do sell the shares should you have an emergency in the worst case scenario let 's say you have a financial emergency    at the same time the stock market crashes and loses half its value    you could still liquidate the rest and have sufficient funds for 6    months am i underestimating the risks of this strategy that 's not worst case scenario though worst case scenario would be another 9/11 where the markets are closed for nearly a week and you need the money but ca n't get the funds converted to cash in the bank that you can use this is in addition to the potential wait for a settlement in the case of using etfs if you choose to go that way in the case of money market funds cds and other near cash equivalents these can be accessed relatively easily which is part of the point a approach where some cash is kept in house some in accounts that can easily accessed and some in other investments may make sense though the breakdown would differ depending on how much risk people are willing to take if it truly is an emergency fund then the odds of needing it should be    very slim so why live with near zero return on that money something to consider is what is called an emergency here for some people a sudden $ 1,000 bill to fix their car that just broke down is an emergency for others there could be emergency trips to visit family that may have gotten into accidents or gotten a diagnosis that they may pass away soon consider what do you want to call an emergency here as chances are you may not be considering all that people would think is an emergency there is the question of what other sources of money do you have to cover should issues arise

yes depending on what you 're trying to achieve if its just a symbolic gift you can use a service like this there are several companies providing this service look them up but the prices are fairly the same you 'll end up getting a real stock certificate but it will cost a lot of overhead around $ 40 to get the certificate and then another $ 40 to deposit it into a brokerage account if you want to sell it on a stock exchange so although the certificate is real and the person whose name on it is a full blown shareholder it does n't actually have much value unless you buy a google or apple stock where the price is much much higher than the fees take into account that it takes around 2 months for the certificate to be issued and mailed to you so time accordingly otherwise you can open a custodial brokerage account and use it to buy stocks for the minor both ways are secure and legal each for its own purpose and with its own fees

technical people on reddit who have dealt with oracle or similar web sites amp systems myself included seem to believe that oregon 's claims come down to whether it was oracle or the state government who was worse at planning the creation and maintenance of oregon 's healthcare web site   i tend to think that government entities are often worse at managing amp planning things and therefore believe that oracle would be less likely to blame but this does n't necessarily mean that all of the more than dozen claims for damages will all be thrown out either   one key claim is that oracle asserted that of the web site 's functionality would work out of the box thus leaving only 5 of the web site 's functionality requiring third party potentially custom integration   the burden is on oregon to prove that the failures of the web site were the result of more than that 5 and that oracle was contractually obligated to fix issues with the at no additional charge   failure to prove that would result in oracle being justified in asking for more $ to fix the web site such that the alleged and much of the fraud did not actually take place

cd 's are not compressed later specifications added surround sound encoding higher sampling rates and bit depths compression especially compression is a different animal and some later formats may use some form of compression but the cd version of encoding is not considered compression   the spec was designed to exceed the range of normal human hearing and if properly implemented it 's suitable for that purpose there are a lot variations in terms of recording mastering and in terms of the quality of the gear involved and the techniques used which is probably what the sentence you quoted meant i.e.   cd recorded on a cheap setup using default settings and playing it back on a budget consumer player might not sound as good as a vinyl record mastered by a pro and played back on a high quality pickup connected to an grade and speakers and vice versa

you 'll have to research the canada side of things on your own or maybe someone else can answer that side for the germany side there is a gift tax which depends on the relationship of the giver and receiver has an overview here which shows the tax class and tax free amount so according to the overview nieces get 20 000 € tax free amount anything over 20 000 € within 10 years from the same gift giver will be taxed with tax class 2 which can range from 15 to 43 depending on the gifted amount the full article is here it also a few tricks for example if you want to gift 40 000 € to your niece you could gift 20 000 € directly and 20 000 € to your brother or sister who then gifts it to their daughter you 'll have to trust them to do that though because you ca n't put that in a contract bottom line of this if you want to gift more than 20 000 € your niece should contact a tax advisor   about the bank transfer your niece will have to declare any bank transfers over 12 500 € that she receives her bank will know how to do that so she should just ask them it also might be helpful for her to have a letter from you stating that the money came from you and is a gift just in case the tax office does n't believe that the money is n't from

the point of title insurance is that when you buy a house it is possible that you may eventually find out that the seller did n't actually own the property either because they were trying to deceive you or some transfer of ownership in the past was n't carried out properly if that happens you can find yourself with no house and still owing the the purchase price hardly anybody can afford to take that kind of hit which is why you need some form of protection against it the traditional way of doing this was to get a lawyer to do a title search in which they check that everything in order however this costs tens of dollars at least to do the work for every sale and hardly ever finds anything title insurance is a company volunteering to take the hit for you if there turns out to be a problem in return for a payment of less than the title search would cost in essence they are saying that it 's cheaper to take the risk than do the work what are the statistics this report seems to indicate that payout is around 5 of premium but title insurance is a one off premium and the payout can theoretically happen many years down the line however it is almost certain that the insurance companies have done the math and believe that selling this insurance will be profitable for them so they believe that payouts are going to be substantially less than 100 is title insurance worth it for you if the payout is 5 of premiums the in a purely statistical sense it is not worth it you would on average gain more by not taking it however that is true of almost all insurance the policy is there to protect you in the unlikely but not impossible event where you would otherwise lose a huge amount of money unless you can afford to lose the value of your house you need some form of protection we 've already seen that the only other form of protection is a title search and they cost more the other issue is that if you are taking a mortgage your will absolutely insist that you have either a title search or title insurance there is no other way and title insurance is the cheaper of the two in this case it is best to look on the title insurance as simply a cost of doing business it 's irrelevant whether it 's worth it or not you ca n't do the transaction without it

you are very correct rebalancing is basically selling off winners to buy losers of course the thinking is that selling a winner that has already increased 100 on the basis that it has doubled so it is likely to go down in the near future however just look at apple as an example if you bought apple in june 2009 for $ 20 adjusted price and sold it as part of rebalancing when it rose to $ 40 adjusted price in september 2010 you would have missed out on it reaching over $ 95 2 years later similarly you look to rebalance by buying assets which have been say dropped by 50 on the basis that it has dropped so much that it should start increasing in the near future but many times the price can fall even further a better method would be to sell your winners when they stop being winners i.e. their uptrend ends and replace them with assets that are just starting their winning ways i.e. their downtrend has ended and are now starting to uptrend this can be achieved by looking at price action and referring to the definitions of an uptrend and a downtrend definition of an uptrend higher highs and higher lows definition of a downtrend lower lows and lower highs

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

so if a country forces their savings onto another country say the u.s. the u.s. would have to absorb those savings somehow if there were enough productive investments available then this would be a good thing but if there are n't enough productive investments available but the savings are still forced upon the u.s. it would seem that it would inevitably lead to some kind of a debt bubble for the u.s.

basically the banks countrywide was the worst about this failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it was n't in their self after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities the banks then had these sub prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities then s&amp;p and other ratings agencies gave them aaa ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time bombs waiting to go off goldman sachs and everyone else knew what was going on but they did n't want to get stuck holding the bag per se so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities   the problem is n't that we need more it 's that the regulations we have are n't even being enforced obama has prosecuted 1/3 as many financial crimes at bush clinton reagan

i 'll answer this question why do intraday traders close their position at then end of day while most gains can be done overnight buy just before the market close and sell just after it opens is this observation true for other companies or is it specific to apple intraday traders often trade shares of a company using intraday leverage provided by their firm for every $ 5000 dollars they actually have they may be trading with $ 100,000 leverage as an example since a stock can also decrease in value substantially while the markets are closed intraday traders are not allowed to keep their highly leveraged positions opened probabilities fail in a random walk scenario and only one failure can bankrupt you and the firm

the short answer is that you can use student loans for living expenses   joe provides a nice of loans   i would just add that some loans are not only guaranteed but also subsidized   essentially the government buys down the rate of the loan the mechanics are that a financial aid package might consist of grants work study job subsidized and guaranteed loans   one can turn down one or more of the elements of the package   all will be limited in some form the work study will have a maximum number of hours and generally has low pay   many find better deals working in the businesses surrounding the college or starting their own services type business   the grants rarely cover the full cost of tuition and books   the loans will both be limited in amount   it mainly depends on what you qualify for and generally speaking the lower the income the more aid one qualifies for now some students use all their grant all their loan money and buy things that are not necessary   for example are you going to live in the $ dorm or the new fancy apartments that are running $ 800/month   are you going to use the student loan money to buy a car   will it be a new bmw or a 8 year old i see this first hand as i live near a large university   the pubs are filled with college students not working but drinking and eating every night   many of them drive very fancy cars the most onerous example of this is students at the military   attendees have their books and tuition completely paid for   they also receive a stipend and more money can be earned over the summer   they also all qualify for a 35 k student loan in their junior year   just about every kid takes this loan   most of those use the money to buy a car   i know a young lady who did exactly that and so did many of her friends so kids with a starting pay of 45 k also start life with a   buying a nice car in the military is especially silly as they can not drive it while deployed and they are very likely to be deployed   at least however they are guaranteed a starting job with a nice starting pay and upward potential college kids who behave similarly might not have it as good   will they even find work   will the job have the ability to move up   how much security is in the job   one might say that this does not apply to engineers and such but i am working with a fellow with a computer science degree who can not find a job and has not worked in the past 6 months   this even though the market is super hot right now for computer engineers so in a word be very careful what you borrow

this is a very complicated thing to try to do there are many variables and some will come down to personal taste and buying habits first you need to look at each of the loans and find out two very important things   some times you pay a huge penalty for paying off a loan early usually this is on larger loans like your mortgage but it 's not on heard of in car loans if there is a penalty for early re payment then just pay off on the schedule or at least take that penalty into consideration another dirty trick that some banks do is force you to pay the interest first when making a early payment   essentially this is a penalty that ensures you pay the full price of the loan and not a lessor amount because you borrowed for less time the way it really works is complicated but it 's not usually to your benefit to pay these off early either these usually show up on smaller loans but better look for it anyway   next up on the list you need to look at your long term goals and buying habits when are you going to re model your kitchen you can get another loan on the equity of the house it 's much harder to get a loan on the equity of a car even once the car is paid off so depending on your goals you may do better to pay extra into your mortgage then paying off your other loans early   also consider your credit score a big part of it is amount of money remaining on credit lines total credit lines paying of a loan will reduce your credit score short term it will also give you the ability to take out another loan long term    finally consider simplification of debtors if something goes wrong it 's much easier to work with a single debtor then three separate debtors this could mean moving your car loans into your mortgage even if it 's at a higher interest rate should the need arise should you need to do that you will need the equity in your home   bonus points as others have stated there are tax breaks for people with mortgages in some circumstances you should consider those as well car loans usually require a different level of insurance make sure to count that as well taking these points into consideration i would suggest paying off the car loan first then putting the extra $ into your mortgage to build up more equity and leaving the 0 loan to run it 's full course you all ready paid for that loan so might as well use it side note if you can find a savings account or other investment platform with a decent enough interest rate you would be better served putting the $ there a decent rate roth ira would work very nicely for this as you would get tax deferment on that as well sadly it may be hard to find an account with a high enough interest rate to make it a more attractive option the paying off the mortgage early

if there is any fee at all on the cash advance and zero interest on the student loans for now it 's not worth it mathematically   and for only 8 months of free money it 's rare for it to be worth it overall you need to save a significant amount either by having a good net interest rate e.g. saving 20 on another card and not paying any interest on the new loan or by saving a lot on principal e.g. paying off $ 100k now and not paying the interest on that for the next 8 months i would n't worry about it hurting your credit score unless your credit is going to be evaluated during the time you 're maxing your card part of your score 20 30 iirc is your credit utilization ratio which is how much you have available vs. how much you 're using it 's separate from the part that accounts for history so it 's only relevant at the time you 're looked up

usually services like western union or moneygram only give the recipient the money not the information about who and when sent it but you can verify with them directly   however for legal tax reasons your friend might have to declare that it was a gift and where it came from so depending on the country of the destination you might not be able to completely hide from the recipient even if the transfer service technically allows that in any case when you transfer the money out from the us you 'll have to provide your personal identification and information since the usa patriot act it is impossible to transact anonymously not sure if it ever was possible in the us actually

gt;then we will have to agree to disagree   the important thing is that we did n't give any solid advice to the original question   gt;the social discount rate is n't about borrowing it is about funding projects that would return a higher rate to simply say the discount rate is the same as the borrowing rate which is dirt cheap right now is n't wise because different projects offer better social value think of it as your opportunity cost   i agree with you that there may be better projects but i am implying that as long as those other projects irr are above the borrowing rate they also should be basically keep on borrowing and going down the order until the borrowing rate meets the irr of projects not started what every that equilibrium is should be the discount rate   and while someone may say that borrowing takes away from private investment and they are right it is in the best interest of the country to ignore that the market for government securities is global the state could be taking more from foreign private investment than domestic   however this does ignore the manipulation on the rate that goes on from forced lending from citizens social security by law has no choice but to invest in government securities i do n't know i think i 'm just rambling now

the answer is mathematics let 's say you have $ 100 capital to invest with with a mortgage with a unit trust assuming you do n't put in borrowed money 5 growth on the property is $ 25 but a $ 25 profit on a unit trust requires 25 growth well that 's assuming zero interest and zero fees let 's say interest is 3 but so are trust fees a property now requires 8 growth for $ 25 profit in a year where a unit trust now requires 29 growth for $ 25 profit which one is more likely the above calculations do n't take in to consideration all associated costs and is obviously exaggerated but it shows the answer is not black and white but is instead just mathematics on a bunch of variables debt is n't a bad thing so do n't be afraid of using debt with debt you can borrow more to invest having a fully paid off house is not a good investment if some of that equity could be earning you more else where if the math makes sense

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

yes but also note each exchange have rules that states various conditions when the market maker can the bid ask e.g. for situations such as freely falling markets etc and when the market makers need to give a normal bid ask in normal markets the bid asks are usually within exchange dictated bounds   mm 's price spread can be larger than bid ask spread only when there are multiple market makers and different market makers are providing different bid asks as long as the mm under question gives bid and ask within exchange 's rules it can be fine these are usually rare situations one advice please carefully check the time stamps i have seen many occasions when tick data time stamps between different vendors are in databases whereas in real life it is n't   mm 's profits not just from spreads but also from short term mean reversion if a large order comes in suddenly the mm increases the prices in one direction takes the opposite side and once the order is done the prices comes down and the mm off loads his imbalance at lower prices etc

this is basically the short term long term savings question in another form savings that you hope are long term but which may turn short term very suddenly you can never completely eliminate the risk of being forced to draw on long term savings during a period when the market is doing something unpleasant that would force you to take a loss or right before it does something pleasant that you 'd like to be fully invested during you can only pick the degree of risk that you 're willing to accept balancing that hazard of forced sales against the lower but more certain returns you 'd get from a money market or equivalent i 'm considered a moderately aggressive investor which does n't mean i 'm pushing the boundaries on what i 'm buying not by a long shot but which does mean i 'm willing to keep more of my money in the market and i 'm more likely to hold or buy into a dip than to sell off to try to minimize losses that level of risk tolerance also means i 'm willing to maintain a ready cash pool which is sufficient to handle expected emergencies order of $ 10 k and not become overly paranoid about lost opportunity value if it turns out that i need to pull a few thou out of the investments i 've got decent health insurance which helps reduce that risk i 'm also not particularly paranoid about the money on my current track i should be able to maintain my current lifestyle forever without ever touching the principal as long as inflation and returns remain vaguely reasonable having to hit the account for a larger emergency at an inconvenient time would n't be likely to hurt me too much delaying retirement for a year or two perhaps it 's just money emergencies are one of the things it 's for i try not to be stupid about it but i also try not to stress about it more than i must

as i understand it a company raises money by sharing parts of it ownership to people who buy stocks from it   it 's not ownership in quotes it 's ownership in a non ironic way   you own part of the company   if the company has 100 million shares outstanding you own of it per share it 's small but you 're an owner   in most cases you also get to vote on company issues as a shareholder though non voting shares are becoming a thing   after the initial share offer you 're not buying your shares from the company you 're buying your shares from an owner of the company   the company does n't control the price of the shares or the shares themselves i get that some stocks pay dividends and that as these change the price of the stock may change accordingly the company pays a dividend not the stock   the company is distributing earnings to it 's owners your proportion of the earnings are equal to your proportion of ownership   if you own a single share in the company referenced above you would get $ 1 in the case of a $ 100,000,000 dividend of the dividend for your ownership stake i do n't get why the price otherwise goes up or down why demand changes with earnings and speculation on earnings   companies are generally valued based on what they will be worth in the future    what do the prospects look like for this industry   a company that only makes typewriters probably became less valuable as computers became more   was a new law just passed that would hurt our ability to operate   did a new competitor enter the industry to force us to change prices in order to stay competitive   if we have to charge less for our product it stands to reason our earnings in the future will be similarly reduced    so what if the company 's making more money now than it did when i bought the share presumably the company would then be more valuable none of that is filtered my way as a part owner   yes it is as a dividend or in the case of a company not paying a dividend you 're rewarded by an appreciating value why should the value of the shares change a multitude of reasons generally revolving around the company 's ability to profit in the future

there needs to be more numbers with your choices without those any answer is purely speculation assuming that india is much like the us you are almost always better to go with a company leased car   that is if you are not responsible for the lease if your employment ends with the company here in the us companies typically reimburse so tax free their employees for about 50 cents per mile or about 31 cents per   this barely covers the gas and insurance and falls way short when one includes and maintenance   so it is better to have the company to pick up all those costs       borrowing money on a car is just plain dumb no matter what the interest rate   so i would stick with choice number 1 or 3 depending on the arrangement for the company leased car the next question becomes how much you should spend for a car   i would say enough to keep you happy and safe but not much more than that until you are wealthy

here 's an article on it that might help one of the tricky things is that you probably have the value of the vested shares and withheld taxes already on your w-2 this confuses everyone including the irs they sent me one of those audits by mail one year where the issue was they wanted to double count stock compensation that was on both 1099-b and w-2 a quick letter explaining this and they were happy the general idea is that when you first irrevocably own the stock it vests then that 's income because you 're receiving something of value so this goes on a w-2 and is taxed as income not capital gains conceptually you 've just spent however many dollars in income to buy stock so that 's your basis on the stock for tax paid if your employer withheld taxes it should be included in your w-2 in that case you would not separately list it elsewhere

to put a different spin on it suppose you loaned someone $ 100 k expecting that they would pay it back and then a little later they decided not too they are perfectly capable of paying back the money but just decided they did n't want to and it seems the laws of your state said you could n't make them how would you feel about that since this is supposed to be an answer to the question the answer is only if you ca n't afford to repay it that 's what foreclosure is supposed to be about not you deciding you would rather not pay your debts let 's not forget who pays that bill for you every one of your bank 's other customers edit for the people the moral aspect and saying it 's perfectly alright because the law says that 's the punishment and i 'm willing to pay it the law also says if you kill someone you go to prison for life does that mean that someone who decides they are going to kill someone has a perfect right to do it as long as they are prepared to take the consequences

in the united states short term capital gains are taxed at rates similar to regular income which is 25 if you make less than $ and 28 if you make more than that but less than $ 190,000 if you make more than $ 190,000 then the rate is 33 if you hold the stock for a year or more than the tax rate is 15 unless your income is less than $ in which case there is no tax on long term gains as a general rule the way to make money is to stay out of debt so i can not advise you to assume a mortgage financially you are better off investing your money much like you i bought a house with a mortgage using about $ 30,000 in a down payment about 20 years ago and i paid it off a few years ago if i had to do it over again i would have bought a shack a steel building for $ 30,000 and lived in that and invested my income if i had done that i would be about $ 500,000 richer today than i am now

there 's an interesting inter generational dynamic at play here   the fed and tax policy has encouraged asset appreciation for decades to generate wealth effect keep consumer spending up and push economic growth   this was great at the time and benefited asset owners   unfortunately over a long period of time this has led to great income inequality   it 's also raised home prices to a level where millennials and anyone else without a house to find real estate to be unaffordable   adjusting the tax code and putting pressure on prices would slow the economy   it could also create a recession   it would probably put the economy on a stronger footing for growth into the future

gt;my parable shows the mechanics of how money works   no it does n't   it shows the mechanics of how a market for credit derivatives works not money   money has no counterparty risk it is generally a commodity   so the first thing you should have done in your post to explain it to a ten year old is to explain this key distinction   gt;i said i would n't get into the gold standard debate and i wo n't and here 's why   there 's a very important difference between advocating a gold standard and simply pointing out that legal tender laws exist and are n't a good idea   your op 's completely gloss over this fact and they even mislead people into believing that emergent markets naturally use credit derivatives as money rather than commodities which have no counterparty risk

the definition i use for financial independence is 99 confidence that at a specific estimated spending rate per year allowing for estimated inflation and budgeting for likely medical emergencies and taxes on taxable investments the money will me this translates to needing an average annual return on investment which covers the average yearly spending for my purposes that works out to my relying on being able to draw only a 4 income from the money each year which should give me good odds of the money not just being sufficient but being able to deliver that rate forever historically average us stock market rate if return is around 8 that is overkill if course i could plan on the money just barely lasting past my birthday or something of that sort but the goal us to be pretty sure not only that i wo n't run out but that i will have some cash unexpected needs which in turn means that i estimate i need investments times the yearly spending estimate to declare the forever independence retirement or 25x the yearly from that i can calculate how much longer at a given savings rate and rate of return it 'll take for me to reach that target   obviously you need to adjust all these numbers to reflect your opinions understanding if the market your own needs your priorities and expected maximum age and the phase of 's but that 's the basic rationale or you can pay a financial planner to give you this number and a strategy for getting there based on the numbers you give him or her plus some statistical analysis of the market 's overall history

the key here is the bank they hold the title to the car and as such have the final say in things the best thing you can do is to pay off the loan   could you work like crazy and pay off the car in 6 months to a year the next best thing would be to sell the car   you will probably have to cover the depreciation out of pocket   you will also need to have some cash to buy a different car but buy it for cash like you should have done in the first place the worst option and what most people opt for which is why they are broke is to seek to refinance the car   i am not sure why you would have to wait 6 months to a year to refinance but unless you have truly horrific credit a local bank or credit union will be happy for your business   choose this option if you want to continue to be broke for the next five years or so once any of those happen it will be easy to re title the car in your name only provided you are on good terms with the girlfriend   it is just a matter of going to the local title office and her signing over her interest in the car my hope is that you understand the series of foolish decisions that you made in this vehicle purchase and avoid them in the future   or at the very least you consciously make the decision to appear wealthy rather than actually being wealthy

what makes a standard raise depends on how well the economy is doing how well your particular industry is doing and how well your employer is doing all these things change constantly so anyone who says a good raise is 5 or whatever number is being simplistic even if true when he said it it wo n't necessarily be true next year or this year in a different industry etc the thing to do is to look for salary surveys that are reasonably current and applicable if today in your industry the average annual raise is 3 again just making up a number then that 's what you should think of as standard if you want a number okay in general as a first draft number i look for a raise that 's 2 or so above the current inflation rate yes of course i 'd like to get a 20 raise every year but that 's not going to happen in real life on the other hand if a company gives me raises that do n't keep pace with inflation than barring special circumstances i 'm going to be looking for another job but there are all sorts of special circumstances if the economy is in a depression and unemployment in my field is 50 i 'll probably figure i 'm lucky to have a job at all and not be too worried about raises if the economy is booming and all my friends are getting 10 and 20 raises then i 'll want that too as others have said in the united states at least the best way to get a pay raise is to change jobs i think most american companies are absolutely stupid about this they do n't want to give current employees big raises so they let them quit and then hire replacements at a much higher salary than they were paying the guy they just drove to quit and the replacement does n't know the company and may have a lot to learn before he is fully productive and then they congratulate themselves that they kept raises this year to only 3 even though total salaries paid went up by 10 because the new hires demanded higher salaries they actively punish employees for staying with the company reminds me of an article i read in a business magazine by an executive of a cell phone company he the fact that in the cell phone industry it is very hard to keep customers they are constantly switching to other vendors and i thought duh maybe it 's because you offer big discounts for the first year or two and after that you jack your prices up through the roof you actively punish your customers for staying with you more than 2 years and then you wonder why customers leave after 2 years oh if you do change jobs absolutely do not buy a line of we 'll start you off with this lower salary but do n't worry because you 'll get a big raise in a year when you 're looking for a job it 's very easy to turn down a poor offer once you have taken a job leaving to get another job is a big decision and a lot of work so you have way more bargaining power on starting salary than on raises and the company knows it and is trying to take advantage of it also consider not just percentage increase but what you 're making now versus what other people with similar experience are making if people comparable to you are making $ 50k and you 're making $ 30k you 're more likely to get a big raise than if you 're already making $ 80k if the company says we just do n't have the budget to give you a raise the key question is is that true if the company is on the edge of bankruptcy and trying to cut costs everywhere then even if they know you 're a good and productive employee they may really just not have the money to give you a good raise but if business is booming this could just be an excuse it might be an excuse for we 're trying to bleed employees white so the ceo can get another million dollar bonus this year or it might be a for you 're really not a very useful employee and we 're seriously thinking of firing you no way we 're going to give you a raise for the little bit of work you do when you bother to show up my final word be realistic what matters is n't what you want or think you need but what you are worth to the company and what other people with similar skills are willing to work for if you are doing work that brings in $ 20k per year for the company there is no way they are going to pay you more than $ 20k for very long you can go on and on about how expensive it is these days to pay the mortgage and pay medical bills and feed your 10 children and support your cocaine addiction but none of that is relevant to what you are worth to the company likewise if there are millions of people out there who would love to have your job for $ 20k if you demand a lot more than that they 're going to fire you and hire one of them conversely if you 're bringing in $ 100k a year for the company they 'll be willing to pay you a substantial percentage of that

i place 90 of the blame on carly and then the board that bitch was primed by her contract to gut and the company   when a board links a ceos remuneration to annual profit it makes unscrupulous individuals do things which have clear and obvious negative long term impacts but which will hike the annual profit for this year and another year or so but then turn badly negative   because carly is a little bitch and wanted to extract as much money as was humanly possible from her position at hp she on the most disastrous set of actions possible   the direct result is what we see now   ceo compensation should never be linked to profitability for an individual year but to their performance throughout their tenure and then beyond   it 's my belief a ceo should take a base salary of no more than 50 times the mean worker 's salary is not the average because that simply encourages the board to enrich the management team rather than the workers   if the company is profitable for a single year ceos should receive a large bonus say no more than 20 times the mean salary at the company   and 3 years after the ceo leaves he 'd be entitled to another round of payments base on long term performance of the company this means ceos have a duty and a very large responsibility to ensure that their replacement is actually a better ceo than they are   when board members leave there 's no incentive to them personally to ensure their replacement is even capable let alone excellent   the other issue i have with ceos is their stock options or stock grants i believe all companies should have strict rules about stock ownership by the board they must own a certain number of shares and those shares must be purchased before they join the board and demonstrably not by any mechanism which the company pays for   directors and officers with no personal investment interest in the performance of the company are a concern

your plan already answers your own question in the best possible way if you want to be able to make the most possible profit from a large downward move in a stock in this case a stock that tracks gold with a limited defined risk if there is an upward move the optimal strategy is to buy a put option   there are a few exchange traded funds etfs that track the price of gold   think of them as stocks that behave like gold essentially   two good examples that have options are gld and iau when you talk about gold you 'll hear a lot about futures   forget them for now   they do the same essential thing for your purposes but introduce more complexity than you need the way to profit from a downward move without protection against an upward move is by shorting the stock    shorting stock is like the opposite of buying it     you make the amount of money the stock goes down by or lose the amount it goes up by    but since stocks can go up by an infinite amount your possible loss is unlimited if you want to profit on a large downward move without an unlimited loss if you 're wrong and it goes up you need something that makes money as the stock drops but can only lose so much if it goes up    if you want to be guaranteed to lose nothing your best investment option is buying us treasuries and you 're technically still exposed to the risk that us defaults on its debt although if you 're a us resident you 'll likely have bigger problems than your portfolio in that situation buying a put option has the exact exposure you want    you pay a limited premium to buy it and at expiration you essentially make the full amount that the stock has declined below the strike price less what you paid for the option    that last part is important because you pay a premium for the option if it 's down just a little you might still lose some or all of what you paid for it which is what you give up in exchange for it limiting your maximum loss but wait you might say   when i buy an option i can lose all of my money ca nt i   yes you can     here 's the key to understanding the way options limit risk as compared to the corresponding way to get normal exposure through getting long or in your case short the stock if you use the number of options that represent the number of shares you would have bought you will have much much less total money at risk if you spend the same bag o cash on options as you would have spent on stock you will have exposure to way more shares and have the same amount of money at risk as if you bought the stock but will be much more likely to lose it the first way limits the total money at risk for a similar level of exposure the second way gets you exposure to a much larger amount of the stock for the same money increasing your risk so the best answer to your described need is already in the question    buy a put   i 'd probably look at gld to buy it on simply because it 's generally a little more liquid than iau and if you 're new to options consider the following paper trade first   either just keep track of fake buys and sells on a spreadsheet or use one of the many online services where you can track investments they do n't know or care if they 're real or not check out   they are an excellent learning resource that is n't trying to sell you anything their only reason to exist is to promote options education    if you do put on a trade do n't forget that the most frustrating pitfall with buying options is this   you can be basically right and still lose some or all of what you invest   this happens two ways so think about them both before you trade if the stock goes in the direction you think but not enough to make back your premium you can still lose   so you need to make sure you know how far down the stock has to be to make back your premium   at expiration it 's simple you need it to be below the strike price by more than what you paid for the option with options timing is everything   if the stock goes down a ton or even to zero free gold but only after your option expires you were essentially right but lose all your money   so while you do n't want to buy an option that 's longer than you need since the premium is higher if you 're not sure if an expiration is long enough out it is n't you need the next one edit to address update i 'm not sure not long enough was the problem here but if the question is just how to ensure there is a limited defined amount you can lose even if you want the possible loss to be much less than you can potentially make the put strategy described already does that if the stock you use is at $ 100 and you buy a put with a 100 strike for $ 5 you can make up to $ 95    this occurs if the stock goes to zero meaning you could buy it for nothing and sell it for $ 100 netting $ 95 after the $ 5 you paid    but you can only lose $ 5 so the put strategy covers you if the goal is to have no real risk of loss there 's no way to have any real gain above what 's sometimes called the risk free rate   for simplicity 's sake think of that as what you 'd get from us treasuries as mentioned above if the goal is to make money whether the stock or gold goes either up or down that 's possible but note that you still have a fairly high risk of loss which occurs if it fails to move either up or down by enough   that strategy in its most common form is called a straddle which basically means you buy a call and a put with the same strike price   using the same $ 100 example you could buy the calls for $ 5 and the puts for $ 5   now you 've spent $ 10 total and you make money if the stock is up or down by more than $ 10 at expiration over 110 or under 90    but if it 's between 90 and 100 you lose money as one of your options will be worthless and the other is worth less than the $ 10 total you paid for them both

i 'm not going to tackle the 2nd part of your question as any number of the questions tagged with international transfer should cover you on that there 's no way to transfer an isa into an australian tax free savings account so no need to worry about anything special there do n't forget that the fx rates change quite a bit over time and different methods have varying fees so moving at the wrong time could easily cost you more than the missed interest for the first part it depends one thing you should seriously consider right away is switching your isa money into one paying a better rate check the best buy tables online or in a paper as you can get a lot better than 0.1 on a transfer in even with current depressed rates at least that way you 'll earn more interest while you decide as for when to transfer that 's something you 'll have to calculate for yourself based on your marginal tax rate and your view of how the fx rates will shift if you 're a 40 taxpayer then 2 in an isa is worth the same to you as 3.3 gross do n't forget to consider both your uk and australian tax rates in the year you move as most likely you 'll have to pay the higher of the two the westpac rate looks like you might struggle to beat a decent isa over the course of a year were you a higher rate tax payer oh and do n't forget that you 'll likely loose the tax free status of your isa once you 're an australian tax resident so you 'll need to start paying tax on interest in the isa once you 're out there

with all due respect to the david the $ 1000 is best put against 20%+ debt no sitting in checking as part of some emergency fund   i 'd agree with the decision to pay off the lower rate card why because we can do the math and can see the cost in doing so low enough that other factors come in namely a freed up card that card can function as the emergency one in the short term long term once these high rate cards are paid off you 'll build your proper emergency fund but the cost is too high right now   the $ 4000 is a nice start but the most important thing is to get your budget under control only you can decide how much you can cut back and go after this debt as if it were life or death

most of the consumer products that you buy at retail these days are commodity priced and have been for a long time margins are thin so if there are retail salespeople about their compensation is n't coming from the tv or computer with a 6 gross margin it comes from the extended warranty programs which are not insurance and do not have regulated underwriting standards which are typically sold at a 65 95 gross margin so that $ 200 warranty most likely costs the retailer $ 50 the salesman gets $ 15 25 i paid for my college education working at a selling these things along with other high margin items that paid commission in most cases you are n't getting much coverage anyway most products carry a 1 year warranty and using most gold or platinum credit cards doubles a manufacturer 's warranty by up to 1 year so with most transactions you are already walking away with a 2 year warranty   warranties or service plans make sense for durable goods that cost alot and are expected to last a long time and/or require regular maintenance i think they especially make sense if your budget is really tight a fixed maintenance cost can be an asset to some people because they can plan around it examples of this include service plans for a furnace boiler or water heater or a car if you 're buying a manufacturer endorsed service maintenance plan from a dealer

your question boils down to saving for a house or saving for retirement why not do both if you invest in a roth 401k or roth ira you can withdraw any contributions that are at least 5 years old without penalty assuming you 're willing to put off purchasing a little longer than your original 2 3 years if you qualify as a first time home buyer i.e. you have n't owned a home in at least 2 years you can withdraw investment earnings as well if your distribution is earmarked towards the down payment and is no more than $ 10000 although you wo n't be penalized for using investment earnings for a down payment you will still have to pay taxes on them so this may be more appealing to someone that has enough contributions to avoid dipping into the investment earnings the only other downside is that contributions to a roth investment are not tax deductible like traditional ira and 401k contributions are instead they grow tax free and distributions are tax free when you reach retirement age

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

investments earn income relative to the principal amounts invested if you do not have much to invest then the only way to get rich by investing is to take gambles and those gambles are more likely to fail than succeed the simplest way for someone without a high amount of capital funds available to invest to build wealth is to work more and invest in yourself go to school but only for proven career paths take self study courses learn and expand your career opportunities   only once you are stable financially have minimal debt or understand and respect the debt you plan to pay down slowly which some people choose to do with school and house debt and are able to begin contributing regularly to investment plans can you put your financial focus on investing until then any investment gains would pale in comparison to gains from building your career

cd laddering is a process of buying multiple cds at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity the benefit of a cd ladder is based on this assumption   without higher rates for longer terms i would n't ladder cds   so let 's assume you have $ 10,000 to invest    and let 's say you have a 12 month cd at 1 and a 24 month cd at 2 available to purchase you could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month cd at 2    this is a good rate of return but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned the laddering approach is to buy longer term cds over a regular interval    in this case we could buy a 2 year cd at 2 every 6 months    your ladder would look like this this gives you the 2 year rate 2 but you are always less than 6 months until your next cd matures giving you some liquidity when each cd matures you then purchase another 2 year cd at the more beneficial rate   you 'll always have something maturing every 6 months now if you want to start with your money immediately you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this the two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples   you could have 12 cds with one maturing every month one maturing every quarter etc the benefits of cd laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be the risks of cd laddering are the same as the risks of buying cds   if you think cds are a good investment cd laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates

the only reason i can think of would be if you were convinced that you could n't hold on to your money treasury bonds are often viewed as very safe investments and often used in some situations where cash is n't appropriate also they typically have a somewhat patriotic theme helping your country to grow in addition many people do n't really pay attention to the rate of the bonds but are just investing in them the more people investing in them the lower the yields become but the bottom line is i would invest in a savings account any day over a negative interest rate and it looks like i 'm in good company as well a quick study of reports seems to indicate that these are a very bad investment

the rental income is indeed taxable income but you reduce the taxable portion of it by deducting expenses including mortgage interest maintenance insurance hoa real estate tax and of course depreciation due to the depreciation you may end up breaking even or having very little taxable income note that when you sell the property your basis is reduced by the depreciation you were allowed to deduct even if you have n't deducted it for whatever reason and also the personal residence exclusion might no longer be applicable i.e. you 'll have to pay capital gains tax you will not be able to deduct a loss though if you sell now so it may be better to depreciate it as a rental rather then sell at a loss that wo n't affect your taxes also consider the fact that the basis for the depreciation is not the basis you currently have in the property because you 're under water you have to remember that when calculating the taxes this is not a tax advice and you should seek a professional help

my wife and i set up a shared bank account we knew the monthly costs of the mortgage and estimated the cost of utilities each month we transferred enough to cover these plus about 20 so we could make an extra mortgage payment each year and build up an emergency fund and did so using automatic transactions other shared expenses such as groceries we handled on an ad hoc basis settling up every month or three we initially just split everything 50 50 because we both earned roughly the same income when that changed we ended up going with a 60 40 split we maintained our separate bank accounts though this may have changed in the future a system like this may work for you or may at least provide a starting point for a discussion and i do strongly advise having a frank and open discussion on these points dealing with money can be tricky in the bounds of a marriage

like others have already said it may cause an immediate dip due to a large and sudden move in shares for that particular stock however if there is nothing else affecting the company 's financials and investors perceive no other risks it will probably bounce back a bit but not back to the full value before the shares were issued why whenever a company issues more stock the new shares dilute the value of the current shares outstanding simply because there are now more shares of that stock trading on the market the earnings per share eps ratio will drop since the same profit and company value has to be spread across more shares example   if a company is valued at $ 100 dollars and they have 25 shares outstanding then the eps ratio equates to $ 4 per share = 4   if the company then issues more shares stock to employees who sell or keep them let 's say 25 more shares then shares outstanding increase to 50 but the company 's value still remains at $ 100 dollars eps now equates to $ 2 per share = 2 now sometimes when shareholders especially employees and especially employees who just received them suddenly all sell their shares this causes a micro panic in the market because investors believe the employees know something bad about the company that they do n't other common shareholders then want to dump their holdings for fear of impending collapse in the company this could cause the share price to dip a bit below the new diluted value but again if no real immediate risks exist the price should go back up to the new diluted value example 2 if eps was at $ 4 before issuing more stock and then dropped to $ 2 after issuing new stock the micro panic may cause the eps to drop below $ 2 and then soon rebound back to $ 2 or more when investors realize no actual risk exists after the dilution phase plays out the eps could actually even go above the pre issuing value of $ 4 because investors may believe that since more stock was issued due to good profits more profits may ensue hope that helps

i can do better i can show you policy docs   gt religious organization exception under title vii religious organizations are permitted to give employment preference to members of their own religion the exception applies only to those institutions whose purpose and character are primarily religious factors to consider that would indicate whether an entity is religious include whether its articles of incorporation state a religious purpose whether its day to day operations are religious e.g. are the services the entity performs the product it produces or the educational curriculum it provides directed toward of the religion whether it is not for profit and whether it affiliated with or supported by a church or other religious organization   looks like my plumbing example may have been extreme because it does n't necessarily have a religious purpose under those terms but to be fair neither does the fortune 500 christian insurance company whose primary purpose is to sell insurance i was referring to earlier whose large legal department said we were legally safe to hire only christian salesmen and board members

my suggestion would be to ask the planner as an initial question as there could be a couple possible explanations for a free meeting initial consultation within some industries there will be that first meeting which is free to see how well do two people work together   in canada there are some lawyers that will give a half hour of their time and i 'd imagine some financial planners may have a similar practice   this would be where that first meeting is a half hour or hour to see what is your situation and what expertise do you want that the planner would have straight commission there is also the possibility that the planner is compensated by the products you purchase through him   in this case the mutual fund companies insurance companies and other institutions that he recommends will be handling his compensation   while this does present a conflict of interest you have to decide whether you want a fee only planner which would n't have this issue though you 'd have to pay out of pocket something to consider is what are you bringing to this meeting and how long is it intended to be   if you are bringing a lot of paperwork then it is definitely worth asking upfront while if it is an informal chat for a half hour then things may be different

you should check with your broker i asked my broker a similar question just 2 weeks ago with their market orders they will be filled within 3 points from the current market bid ask if there is any remaining it will be placed as a limit order at 3 points away from the bid ask price for example if the current ask is 100 $ 1.00 followed by 500 $ 1.01 300 $ 1.02 and 100 $ 1.03 if you were to place a buy market order for 1000 shares you would get 100 filled at $ 1.00 500 filled at $ 1.01 300 filled at $ 1.02 and 100 filled at $ 1.03   if on the other hand you were to place a buy market order for 2000 shares you would get 100 filled at $ 1.00 500 filled at $ 1.01 300 filled at $ 1.02 and 100 filled at $ 1.03 with the remaining 1000 of your order being placed as a limit order at $ 1.03 again check with your broker as they may be different in how they treat their market orders

gt securitize the mortgages and sell them off to clients   to expand on that these loans were being packaged with 100s of others and sold to investors who could not possibly be bothered with examining each of the properties or borrowers   they were sold for decent fees to the bank and if the bank sold them all had no risk and pocketed fees from both ends   the banks needed as many loans as possible because they thought they could sell them all   the significance of this admission is n't so much that it was always ridiculous that the illiterate and unsophisticated were taking advantage of banks generosity but that they can no longer say the ridiculous with a straight face

much of the interest on a loan comes in the first years of a mortgage so the sooner you can pay that off the better   but let 's see what the numbers say if you have a loan at 4 principal of $ 100,000 a term of 30 years then this gives monthly payments of $ using the excel pmt function if you sell the house after precisely 5 years worth of payments then you have made $ in payments you still owe $ suppose you sell the house for $ 100,000   that means you will be in the hole for $ 100,000 $ $ = now suppose you pay an extra $ 50 per month over the five years   the same calculation becomes $ 100,000 $ $ = so in this scenario which is a little simplistic you are $ better off the question you have to ask is whether you could have done better investing the $ 3,000 in extra payments somewhere else the cagr in doing this is 1.7 so you might be better off putting the money away running the same numbers for a 6 mortgage the cagr you have is about 2.7 edit i 've added a google docs spreadsheet read only that you can download and play with   feel free to correct anything you find edit 2   ok so i 've had a look at what joetaxpayer is saying in the comments below and now i agree   the cagr should be 4 where i want wrong was to assume that the $ 50 per month payments over the five years are worth $ 50 5 12 = $ 3000    this neglects the time value of money having small amounts of money periodically rather than all of it in a lump sum including this makes the effective value of the monthly $ 50 payments $ written as = in excel or google docs i 've added a tab to the original spreadsheet to show the different calculations   note that it still does n't quite come to 4 but i guess it 's a minor error in the sheet nb i know i 'm leaving out mortgage interest tax relief costs for selling etc etc

two kinds of lending going on the first occurs when the federal reserve purchases government securities   this creates reserves at the federal reserve in another bank the second kind of lending comes when this bank lends out the money   this is the multiplier effect the reason for the excess reserves now is that banks are gun shy and afraid to lend   their money is safer at the fed than with commercial and personal borrowers   when this changes either by a recovery or by the fed penalizing banks for excess reserves which it can do but has n't then we 'll see inflation and a consequential rise in prices

i honestly do n't understand this sense of entitlement to being able to use your own device   by giving an employee access to sensitive data on their own device you are taking a risk that the company can not technologically or legally mitigate in the uk it would be a de facto breach of the data protection act   if there was a on an employee 's phone or laptop and they got access to any sensitive data then game over    this is not about inconvenience it is about not costing the companies in question billions in fines it is simply not worth it especially as most employees are perfectly capable of losing work computers on trains and so on so trusting them to look after their own system security is asking a bit much   what happens if they lose their own laptop a work laptop can be set to self destruct but few employees are going to let their companies have that level of control over their laptop and here in the uk if sensitive data is lost in that way and can be recovered using forensic tools then bam fines a company has a legal obligation to ensure that their employee 's and customer 's data is safe and any data accessed on a phone or laptop is still stored somewhere on that phone or laptop   third party software like dropbox is notoriously insecure too so that should n't ever be used on a machine containing sensitive data it 's hard enough getting employees to take security seriously before exponentially increasing these risks as you describe

as others have stated the current price is simply the last price at which the security traded for any given tick however there are many bid ask prices because securities can trade on multiple exchanges and between many agents on a single exchange this is true for both types of exchanges that chris mentioned in his answer chris answer is pretty thorough in explaining how the two types of exchanges work so i 'll just add some minor details in exchanges like nasdaq there are multiple market makers for most relatively liquid securities which theoretically introduces competition between them and therefore lowers the bid ask spreads that traders face although this results in the market makers earning less compensation for their risk they hope to make up the difference by making the market for highly liquid securities this could also result in your order filling in pieces at several different prices if your brokerage firm fills it through multiple market makers of course if you place your order on an exchange where an electronic system fills it the other type of exchange that chris mentioned this could happen anyway   in short if you place a market order for 1000 shares it could be filled at several different prices depending on volume multiple bid ask prices etc if you place a sizable order your broker may fill it in pieces regardless to prevent you from moving the market this is rarely a problem for small time investors trading securities with high volumes but for investors with higher capital like institutional investors mutual funds etc who place large orders relative to the average volume this could conceivably be a burden both in the price difference across time as the order is placed and the increased bookkeeping it demands   this is tangentially related so i 'll add it anyway in cases like the one described above all or none orders are one solution these are orders that instruct the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction most brokers offer these but there are some caveats that apply to them specifically i have n't been able to find some of this information so some of this is from memory   all or none orders are only an option if the order is for more than a certain numbers of shares i think the minimum size is 300 or 400 shares   your order wo n't be placed until your broker places all other orders ahead of it that do n't have special conditions attached to them   i believe all or none orders are day orders which means that if there was n't enough supply to fill the order during the day the order is cancelled at market close   orders only apply to limit orders if you want to replicate the behavior of a market order with characteristics you can try setting a limit buy sell order a few cents above below the current market price

a roth ira is intended for retirement before age 59.5 i think you can only withdraw the amount you deposited without penalty it 's great you 're saving in a roth but you should n't put savings in there that you will need before you reach sufficient age and since it 's long term you can invest in things you expect to grow over the long term like equities you should keep emergency funds either in federally insured extremely liquid accounts bank savings or money market funds which are n't insured but are close enough to zero risk yes the interest rates are terrible right now but anything else would potentially leave you with insufficient funds in the event of you know an emergency

also to add to my other point you do n't give more money to someone who ca n't use the money they already have wisely for example a friend borrows your money to pay his rent and he blows it all on alcohol and cigarettes and when he asks you for more you do n't give more to him you direct him to a place where he can solve his problems the same needs to happen with the us the money they recieve now is more then enough to run the country

you need receipts only if you claim deductions in the itemized deductions section based on them you itemize deductions only if your claims exceed the standard deduction which for a single person was $ 5,800 last year even then you need receipts for everything only if you claim sales tax as the deduction you have to buy really a lot to pass $ 5 k with sales tax i would expect people to pay more in state income taxes than sales taxes you can claim either this or that not both for food there are no taxes at least here in california so nothing to deduct anyway in any case you can always scan your receipts and keep them in the computer for just in case but imho it 's waste of time pixels and here 's a question which deals with the same issue read the answers there as well

etiquette or not it is hurting the seller the transaction fees have usually minimums so if the actual transaction is below the minimum they 'll pay larger fee on the transaction relatively as an example assume minimum fee for a debit card swipe is 20 cents or 2 of the transaction for a transaction of $ 10 and above the fee will be 2 of the transaction but for $ the fee becomes 12 of the transaction 6 times more expensive for the seller basically the sale was most likely at a loss for them they usually have very low margins especially for a dollar store so take that into account as well

i believe that article provides some good reasons though it may be a bit light on technical details and there are likely other reasons a company would do it so if they can finance for less then they would lose to taxes by bringing the money home and they do not take on too much debt this will likely work just fine and increase share holder value hopefully someone else can provide some other reasonable scenarios the bottom line is that it does not matter how they finance the share buybacks and/or dividend payments as long as they do not shoot themselves in the foot while doing it

any amount any length of repay time ask if you can have a billion dollars for a billion years on a more serious note that would actually be horrible advice because your monthly payment $ 2.5 m would be the same at 669 years so any term longer than that would be literally throwing money away though one could argue that 669 years compared to is also throwing money away since you 'd be paying an extra $ 30 m over the course of the extra year to lower your payment by just 1 cent per month but who are we to judge

i know that both lowes and home depot in canada at least will offer a 6 month deferred interest payment on all purchases over a certain dollar amount iirc $ 500 + and sometimes run product specific 1 year deferred interest specials this is a very effective way of financing renovations details you 've probably seen deferred interest it 's very commonly used in furniture sales no money down no interest do not pay for 1 full year   personally i think it 's a plot by the point manufacturers it works like this typically i manage these types of purchases by dividing the principal by 6 and then adding 5 and paying that amount each month   pay close attention to the end date because you do not want to pay 22 interest on the entire amount    this also requires that you watch your card balance carefully   all payments are usually put to current purchases i.e. those not under a plan first before they are applied to the plan balance   so if you are paying 250 a month on the new floor and run up another $ 150 on paint you need to pay the entire new balance and then the $ 250 floor payment in order for it to be applied correctly   also < shameless plug > < plug >   consider doing it yourself

i thought the finance buff made a pretty solid argument for a financial advisor the other day but 1.5 is too expensive the blog post at finance buff suggests several alternatives he also has the great suggestion to use vanguard 's cheap financial planning service if you go with vanguard a lot of investing advice fails to consider the human factor sure it 'd be great to rebalance exactly every 6 months and take precisely the amount of risk to theoretically maximize returns but yeah right it 's well known that in the aggregate individual investors go to cash near market bottoms and then buy near market tops it 's not that they do n't know the right thing to do necessarily it 's just that the emotional aspect is stronger than any of us expect you should n't rely on sticking to your investments any more than you rely on sticking to your diet and exercise program the theoretically optimal solution is not the real world people are involved optimal solution my own blog post on this suggests a balanced fund rather than a financial advisor but i think the right financial advisor could well be a better approach http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ anyway i think people are too quick to think of the main risk as volatility and to think of investing as simple sure in theory it is simple but the main risk is yourself fear at market bottoms greed at market tops laziness the rest of the time so there 's potential value in taking yourself out of the picture the human part is the part that is n't simple on whether to get a financial advisor in general not just for investments see also what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money

if you pay off a debt through a collections agency it will damage your credit   here 's an alternative approach   settling a $ 10 k loan for $ 2 k shows the lender is keen to settle    instead of paying the collections agency negotiate with the lender and agree to pay 2 k to settle provided that they agree to this could be a win win for both   the lender gets to keep full 2 k without having to pay the collection agency a fat commission and your credit is n't damaged not saying this will always work but worth a try    pro tip get everything in writing before you pay anything

there are two scenarios to determine the relevant date and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price if the stocks were purchased in your name from the start then the relevant date is the date of the purchase if the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died you can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase if it was in street name they may not have such records and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them once you   figured out the relevant date contact the company 's investor relationships contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splits mergers acquisitions whatever that would be the cost basis per share you would be using alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site google yahoo bloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed if you can not figure the cost basis or it costs too much you can just write cost basis as $ 0 and claim the whole proceeds as gains you 'll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers

yes management fees cut directly into your profits a fund which achieves 8 growth but costs 1 to maintain delivers only 7 to you compounded over years even a relatively small difference can add up to a significant amount of money this is one of the advantages index funds have they may not be as sophisticated as human managed funds but their expense ratio is so much lower that the end result for the investor is often as good as or better than the more expensive products in fact at least one study found that for each category they researched low expense ratio was a better predictor of good return on investment than anything else they looked at that does n't mean cheapest is always best or most expensive is always worst but it does mean you should be very very sure an expensive fund really is that much better before choosing it and sticking with simple index funds may be a perfectly reasonable choice

if you do n't want to take any risk and you want your money to be liquid then the best place to invest such money is in an insured bank deposit such as a high interest savings account however you are n't likely to find a savings account interest rate that comes close to that charged by your mortgage so the better decision from a numbers perspective is to pay down more on your mortgage or other debt paying down your debt has almost no risk but has a better payoff than simply saving the money in a bank account however if you choose to pay down more debt i suggest you still keep aside enough cash to have an adequate emergency fund   since you want safety and liquidity do n't expect high returns from such money

what most respondents are forgetting is when a company allows its employees to purchase its shares at a discount with their salary the employee is usually required to hold the stock for a number of years before they can sell them the reason the company is allowing or promoting its employees to purchase its shares at a discount is to give the employees a sense of ownership of the company being a part owner in the company the employee will want the company to succeed and will tend to be more productive if employees were allowed to purchase the shares at a discount and sell them straight away it would defeat this purpose your best option to decide whether or not to buy the shares is to work out if the investment is a good one as per any other investment you would undertake i.e. determine how the company is currently performing and what its future prospects are likely to be regarding what percentage of pay to purchase the shares with if you do decide to buy them you need to work that out based on your current and future budgetary needs and your savings plan for the future

the largest problem and source of anxiety ruin for homeowners during the housing market collapse was caused by the inability to refinance many people had bought homes which they were stretched to afford by using variable rate mortgages   these would typically offer a very attractive initial rate with an annual cap on the potential increase of rate   many of these people intended to refinance their variable rate to a fixed rate once terms were more favorable   if their house wo n't appraise for the value needed to obtain a new loan they are stuck in their current contract with potentially unfavorable rates in the later years above prime was not unheard of also many people especially those in areas of high inflation in the housing market used a financial device known as a balloon mortgage which essentially forced you to get a new loan after some number of years 2 5 10 when the entire note became due   some of those loans offered payments less than principal + interest so say you move near los angeles and ca n't afford the $ 1.2 m for the ranch in which you wish to live   you might work out a deal with your mortgage broker banker in which you agree contractually to only pay $ 500/month with a balloon payment of $ 1.4 m due in 5 years which seemed like a good deal since you and everyone else actually expect the house to be worth $ 1.5 m in 5 years this type of thing was done all the time back in the day   now imagine the housing bubble bursts and your $ 1.2 m home is suddenly only valued at perhaps $ 750k   you still owe $ 1.4 m sometime in the next several years maybe very soon depending on timing and can only get approved financing for the current $ 750k value so you 're basically anticipating becoming homeless and bankrupt within the same year that is a source of much anxiety about being upside down on a loan see this question for an unfortunate example

two of the main ways that investors benefit financially from a stock are dividends and increases in the price of the stock   in the example as described the benefits came primarily from dividends leaving less benefits to be realized in terms of an increase in the value of the company another way to put that is that the company paid its profits to shareholders in the form of a dividend instead of accumulating that as an increase in the value of the company   the company could have chosen to take those profits and reinvest them in growing the business which would lead to lower dividends but hopefully an increase in the valuation of the stock but they chose to pay dividends instead   this still rewards the investors but   share prices stay low

you wo n't be able to know the trading activity in a timely actionable method in most cases the exception is if the investor individual fund holding company non profit foundation etc is a large shareholder of a specific company and therefore required to file their intentions to buy or sell with the sec the threshold for this is usually if they own 5 or greater of the outstanding shares you can however get a sense of the holdings for some of the entities you mention with some publicly traded holding companies since you mention warren buffett berkshire hathaway is an example of this publicly traded companies that are traded on a us based exchange have to file numerous reports with the sec of these you should review their annual report and monitor all filings on the sec 's website here 's the link to the berkshire hathaway profile private foundations harvard and yale have private non profit foundations the first place to look would be at the form 990 filings each is required to file with the irs two sources for these filings are and the keep in mind that if the private foundation is a large enough shareholder in a specific company they too will be required to file their intentions to buy or sell shares in that company private individuals unless the individual publicly releases their current holdings the only insight you may get is what they say publicly or have to disclose   again if they are a major shareholder

future income would impact the price you 'd negotiate for the sale and it may turn to profit for the buyer but it has no impact on you today   you have the sale price and whatever cost has n't been written off the time you put into it does n't matter either an hour to write the program or 5 years only your out of pocket cost is written off against the sale price   if the sales are steady why so low 13 trailing month 's revenue with potential for growth is a very low multiple it 's in the store what is your cost to maintain the product

when you adjust your investments the following will happen initial condition modified condition this means that after this change you will note that the amount of federal tax you pay each month via withholding will go up you are now contributing less pre tax so your taxable income has increased if you make no other changes then in april you will either have increased your refund by 6 months x the additional $ 25 a month or decreased the amount you owe by the same amount there is no change in the total 401 k balance at the end of the year other than accounting for how much is held pre tax vs. roth post tax keep in mind that employer contributions must be pre tax the company could never guess what your tax situation is they withhold money for taxes based on the form you fill out but they have no idea of your family 's tax situation if you fail to have enough withheld you pay the penalty not the company the tax savings are complex because it depends on marital status your other pre tax amounts for medical and how much income your spouse makes plus your other income and deductions

as phil notes converting to roth means paying tax on the entire amount of the 401k or the entire amount moved anyway   most of the time that 's a bad idea   roth is a good idea when you 're young and paying lower taxes and often have lots of deductions and when your money will have lots of time to appreciate tax free i imagine there could be edge cases though where this could be a good idea   if he 's got a lot of savings which he 's planning to live off of for a few years not the income but the savings itself then he would have $ 0 income for those years   in that case it 's logical to convert some of the 401k to a roth ira to take advantage of lower tax rates probably up to or through the 15 tax rate depending on if his total dollars are enough that he 'll be paying an actual tax rate not marginal higher than 15 or not    now odds are it 's better to take that savings and invest it along with the 401k and then live off of those earnings rather than just spending the savings but i imagine there are some with circumstances where this would make sense particularly if for example he downsized in houses and has a few hundred k from that tax free

so many complicated answers for a straight forward question first to this point i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund an ira can be invested in a mutual fund   the ira benefit over standard mutual fund is pre tax contribution lowering your current tax liability the advantage of an ira over a 401k is control   your employer controls where the 401k is invested you control where your ira is invested   often employers have a very small number of options because this keeps their costs with the brokerage low 401k is amazing if you have employer matched contributions   use them to the maximum your employer will match   after that own your ira   control is key when it comes to your money on ira 's buy roth first   contribute the calendar maximum   then get a traditional   the benefit of roth is that you already paid taxes on the contribution so your withdrawal is not taxed and they do not tax the interest earned like they do on a standard mutual fund

gt;why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering since that goes to helping the company but not for secondhand less necessary trading   because secondary trading determines how easy it is for companies to raise additional money and it also allows the company to manipulate private vs publicly held stakes in their company   we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money   there 's a difference between lending money and investing in a corporation furthermore the income tax code when it comes to lending money via bonds is a complete mess corporate bond coupons are taxed like regular income although the principal return is of course tax free federal and are taxed differently there is also the advantage that you do get a tax break in the event of default so any additional risk you take on has some marginal tax benefits

so i did some queries on google scholar and the term of art academics seem to use is target date fund i notice divided opinions among academics on the matter w. gave a nice set of citations of papers with which he disagrees so i 'll start with them in 1969 paul published the paper lifetime portfolio selection by dynamic programming which found that there 's no mathematical foundation for an age based risk tolerance there seems to be a fundamental quibble relating to present value of future wages if they are stable and uncorrelated with the market one analysis suggests the optimal lifecycle investment should start at roughly 300 percent of your portfolio in stocks via crazy borrowing other people point out that if your wages are correlated with stock returns allocations to stock as low as 20 percent might be optimal so theory is n't helping much perhaps with the advent of computers we can find some kind of empirical data robert shiller authored a study on lifecycle funds when they were proposed for personal social security accounts lifecycle strategies fare poorly in his historical simulation moreover with these life cycle portfolios relatively little is contributed when the allocation to stocks is high since earnings are relatively low in the younger years workers contribute only a little to stocks and do not enjoy a strong effect of    compounding since the proceeds of the early investments are taken out of the stock    market as time goes on and drew follow up on that assertion with a set of lifecycle strategies and their contrarian counterparts whereas a the lifecycle plan starts high stock exposure and trails off near retirement the contrarian ones will invest in bonds and cash early in life and move to stocks after a few years they show that contrarian strategies have higher average returns even at the low 25th percentile of returns it 's only at the bottom 5 or 10 percent where this is reversed one problem with these empirical studies is isolating the effect of the glide path from rebalancing it could be that a simple fixed allocation works plenty fine and that selling winners and doubling down on losers is the fundamental driver of returns and compare lifecycle strategy with a number of fixed asset allocation schemes in monte carlo simulations and conclude that a 70 equity 30 long term corp bonds does as well as all of the lifecycle funds finally the earlier w paper offers a monte carlo simulation similar to and and runs final portfolio values through a utility function designed to calculate diminishing returns to more money this seems like a good point as the risk of your portfolio is n't all or nothing but your first dollar is more valuable than your finds that for some risk aversion coefficients offer greater utility than portfolios with fixed allocations and does note that applying their strategies to the historical record makes a strong recommendation for 100 percent stocks in all but 5 years from 1940 2011 so maybe the best retirement allocation is good old low cost s&p index funds

the creation mechanism for etf 's ensures that the value of the underlying stocks do not diverge significantly from the fund 's value   authorized participants have a strong incentive to arbitrage any pricing differences and create redeem blocks of stock etf until the prices are back inline   contrary to what was stated in a previous answer this mechanism lowers the cost of management of etf 's when compared to mutual funds that must access the market on a regular basis when any investors enter exit the fund the etf only needs to create redeem in a wholesale basis this allows them to operate with management fees that are much lower than those of a mutual fund   expenses due to the passive nature of indexed strategies the internal    expenses of most etfs are considerably lower than those of many mutual    funds of the more than 900 available etfs listed on morningstar in    2010 those with the lowest expense ratios charged about .10 while    those with the highest expenses ran about 1.25 by comparison the    lowest fund fees range from .01 to more than 10 per year for other    funds for more on mutual fund feeds read stop paying high fees

i would just buy one etf index fund on the market you think will perform better it will take care to buy the 5 most solid stock in this market and many other more to reduce the risk to the bear minimum you will also spend only few bucks in definitely less than what you would spend buying multiple stocks even just 5 it 's hard enough to forecast which market will perform better it 's even harder to do stock picking unless you have the time and the knowledge to read into companies balance sheets economic incomes budgets market etc and even if you are great in reading into companies balance sheets economic incomes budgets the stock market usually behaves like a cows drove therefor even if you the most valuable solid stocks be prepared to see them run down even a 50 when all the market runs down a 50 during the 2008 crisis the europe market has lost a 70 and even the most solid sectors stocks like healthcare and food beverage lost a painful 40 to 50 true that now these sectors recovered greatly compared to the rest of the market but they still run down like cows during the crisis and if you them you would have suffered a huge pain stress but obviously there 's always some wizard which will later tell you he was able to select the only 5 stocks among thousands that performed well

you need to consult a lawyer in your area generally speaking though if you breach the t&c they do n't have to follow them either which means that whatever they were responsible for in those terms and conditions they 're no longer responsible   so if you get hacked and they can prove you breached t&c by sharing your credentials they are absolutely off the hook for your financial losses so if they detect you 're in breach they may record it and not pursue any other action unless until you have an issue in which case they say they 're in breach see here here and here   or there may be regulations that require they notify you of their detection of the breach   if this sort of regulation exists i suspect that the notification would also include a termination of all accounts as well   i can also picture situation where a company might have such a policy built into the t&c so that they can steer as clear as possible from any situations involving liability and cyber crime in the same sentence my suggestion would be to take the terms and conditions for your banks to some kind of legal clinic and get them to explain the parts that you do not understand

the question should be do you need a debit card   other than american express i have to tell my other credit card issuers to not make my cards dual debit credit using a debit card card can be summed up easily it creates a risk of fraud errors theft over draft and more while providing absolutely no benefit    it was simply a marketing scheme for card companies to reduce risk that has lost favor although they are still used   that is why banks put it on credit cards by default if they can i am talking about logical people who can control not overspending because of debit vs. credit as it is completely illogical that you would spend more based on what kind of card you have
# 2018
as i see it with a debit card they    are taken kinda out of the game they    are not lending money it seems really    bad for them not exactly it is true that they 're not lending money but they charge a hefty commission from the retailers for each swipe which is pure profit with almost no risk one of the proposals considered or maybe approved already do n't know in congress is to cap that hefty commission which will really make the debit cards merely a service for the checking account holder rather than a profit maker for the bank on the other hand it 's    definitely good for individuals i disagree with that debit cards are easier to use than checks but they provide much less protection than credit cards here 's what i had to say on this a while ago and seems like the community agrees but why do we really need a credit    history to buy some of the more    expensive stuff because the system is broken it rewards people in debt by giving them more opportunities to get into even more debts while people who owe nothing to noone can not get a credit when they do need one with the current system the potential creditor can only asses the risk of someone who has debt already they have no way of assessing risks of someone with no debts to me all this credit card system    seems like an awfully nice way to make    loads of money backed by governments    as well well credit cards have nothing to do with it it 's the credit scores system that is broken if we replace the card with score in your question then yes you 're thinking correctly that of course is true for the us in other countries i have no knowledge on how the creditors assess the risks

  your colleague 's right   the agreement provides that the funds will not contribute to vanguard ’s capitalization or pay for corporate management administrative and distribution services provided by vanguard however each fund will bear its own direct expenses such as legal auditing and custodial fees in addition the agreement further provides that the funds’ direct expenses will be offset in whole or in part by a reimbursement from vanguard for 1 the funds’ contributions to the cost of operating the underlying vanguard funds in which the funds invest and 2 certain savings in administrative and marketing costs that vanguard expects to derive from the funds’ operations the funds expect that the reimbursements should be sufficient to offset most or all of the direct expenses incurred by each fund therefore the funds are expected to operate at a very low or zero direct expense ratio of course there is no guarantee that this will always be the case although the funds are not expected to incur any net expenses directly the funds’ shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the underlying vanguard funds   it 's basically a gamble

taking as given that your definition of va involves selling at intermediate times your question can be made more general   after all value averaging is just one special case of a portfolio that rebalances to target weights periodically do back end fees and front end fees harm the value of portfolios that require rebalancing   the answer is yes they do   those fees are put in place in order to prevent investors from redeeming shares over any but the longest horizons   any portfolio that rebalances periodically will involve some periodic selling   if you invest in a fund with front end or back end fees it is optimal to leave your money in it for as long as possible and not do any rebalancing if you want to run a portfolio that is at all active involves rebalancing then it is probably wise to use no load funds these are often some of the best and cheapest funds anyway but even if front or back end load funds have a lower expense ratio you will likely lose money on those loads as you rebalance

today typically a business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account it is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency so one can have an account number say and have it in say aud and usd so the balance will always show as x aud and y usd if you deposit funds electronic check or cash in usd your usd balance goes up likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies   so in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts with the advantage of remembering only one account number designate a particular currency as default currency so if you do n't quote a currency along with the account number it would be treated as default currency otherwise you always quote the account number and currency of course bundled with other services like free fx advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive edit if you have aud 100 and usd 100 if you try and withdraw usd 110 it will not be allowed unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion   if you deposit a gbp check into the account by default it would get converted into aud assuming aud is the default currency

if you buy a townhouse you often are in a condominium arrangement in the us when you 're really in a in particular   so that 's a downside right away you have to have a hoa or at least some sort of common agreement though it might not have formal meetings   everyone who owns an interest in the entire group of townhouses gets some say in landscaping and such beyond that though townhouses and similarly are often easier to own as they do n't have as much maintenance that you have to do but more expensive because you pay someone to do it the landscaping the external repairs etc   you likely do n't have as much control over what the external looks like because you have to be in agreement with the other owners but you also do n't have to do the work unless your agreement is to collectively do the mowing landscaping which you should know in advance    i would n't underestimate the value of easier by the way it 's very valuable to not have to deal with as many repairs and to be able to go a week without thinking about mowing or watering   in that sense it can be a nice transition into ownership getting some but not all of the obligations   but if that 's something you really value doing the landscaping and mowing and whatnot that 's relevant too   you can always tell your realtor to look for townhouses where the owners do some all of the landscaping though that opens up a different can of worms where you rely on others to do work that they may not do or do well they 're also somewhat you may be sharing a wall but not necessarily air gap townhouses do exist and either way will be closer to your neighbors   does noise bother you   conversely are you noisy   in a college town this is probably something to pay attention to price wise of course stay well within your means if being close to the city center is important that may lead you to buy a townhouse in that area   if being further out is n't a problem you 'll probably have similar choices in terms of price as long as you look in cheaper areas for single family homes

it makes sense for a lot of people it 's basically weather insurance it 's useful for farmers bad weather ruining a harvest airlines abnormally high amount of increasing cost of delayed flights hotels rain making people visit less ski resorts not enough snow and other businesses that can be negatively impacted by extreme weather variations   if they systematically slightly overpay for this protection the speculator can make money on net helping these businesses reduce the volatility of their cashflows which is important because they need to pay their overhead costs every year   edit the derivatives themselves also allows the people selling weather insurance to hedge their exposure on the market

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

as nri pio non resident indian person of indian origin the overseas income and transfers in foreign currency are exempt from indian income taxes however the account in india has to be designated nre or fcnr there are three kind of accounts that an nri can maintain interest earned in nre and fcnr accounts is exempt from income taxes interest earned in nro accounts is not exempt from income taxes in fact banks would withhold about 30 of interest tds the exact tax liability would depend upon income generated in india and tds could be applied towards that liability when the tax returns are filed there are other implications also of designating the account as nre or nro nre accounts can only be funded via inward remittance of permitted foreign currency e.g. deposit usd gbp so proceeds like rental income pension etc that are generated in inr within india ca n't be deposited in this account the money deposited in nre account can grow tax free and can be converted back in any foreign currency freely on the other hand nro accounts can be funded through both inward remittance of permitted foreign currency or local income e.g. rental pension etc all the amount in this account is treated as indian originated inr even if remitted in foreign currency and thus is taxed as any other bank account the amount in this account is subject to the annual cap of of usd 1 million both nre and nro accounts are maintained in inr and can be saving and term deposit any remittance made to these accounts in any foreign currency is converted to inr at the time of deposit and is maintained in inr fcnr account are held in foreign currency and can only be term deposit official definitions accounts for non resident indians nris and persons of indian origin

i 'd talk to a solicitor and see if you can structure the purchase in a way that breaks the property into three pieces one would be the freehold of the whole building one would be a long lease on the downstairs part on which you would get a residential mortgage and one would be a long lease on the upstairs flat on which you would get a buy to let mortgage since there 's essentially no price premium for freehold as opposed to long lease you should be able to raise enough money from the two mortgages to fund the purchase

as the answer above states future inflation mitigates unwise for a longer term mortgage at least in financial only terms   but consider that if you lose your ability to make payments for long enough time anytime during term the lending institution has a right to repossess leaving you with nothing or worse for all the maintenance you 've had to do   you can never know but eleven years into my mortgage i lost enough of my income for just long enough time to have to sell for just enough to pay the remainder of the mortgage and walk away with empty pockets    to help clarify understanding even better contrast the mortgage with the other extreme save up and own from day one   when i did the math a few years ago buying with a 30-year mortgage would cost almost 3 times the real house value in mortgage payments with never the freedom to suspend payments when i might need to   being a freedom loving american i determined to buy a house with cash   don't forget that properties are over priced just because buyers less wise than you are so willing to borrow to buy them so i decided to buy some fixer upper that no bank would lend on   i found such a fixer upper paid cash never have to worry about repossession by a lender can continue to save up for my dream home which i 'll own a lot sooner and will have a nice increase in house value while i fix it up to help get me there and no insurance payments to some insurer who 'll tell me what i ca n't do with my property let the next buyer of your fixed up paid off house pay you the over priced amount they are willing to pay just because they can get that 30-year mortgage and you enjoy the freedom to dream and adjust your budget to the needs of the moment and end up with a house in 30 years 15 more realistically that is 2.5 times more valuable   and keep from fighting with your spouse over finances in the meantime

investors hungry for returns are piling back into securities once tarnished by the financial crisis   complex structured investments developed a bad reputation during the credit crunch ten years later investors seeking yield are overcoming their skepticism and buying into securities that rely on financial engineering to juice returns    volumes of clos or collateralized loan obligations hit a record $ billion in the first nine months of the year according to data from j.p. morgan chase   jpm   amp co. fueled by a wave of and nearly $ 100 billion in new deals that far outpaces their recent full year high of $ billion in 2014 and the peak of $ billion in 2006   the clo boom is the latest sign of the hunt for yield markets stellar performance over the past year has made clos increasingly hard to ignore for investors like insurance companies and pension funds   clos carve up a portfolio of bank loans to highly indebted companies into slices of securities with different levels of risk the securities at the bottom of the clo stack offer the highest potential source of returns but they are also the first to absorb losses if there are defaults in the underlying loan portfolio the more senior slices offer lower returns but are more insulated from losses   clos are often lumped together with other alphabet soup acronyms of the financial crisis such as more toxic cdos or collateralized debt obligations but clos actually the financial crisis well investors who bought at the top of the market in 2007 suffered paper losses but there were no defaults at all for the highest rated securities   that track record has helped boost appeal for investors with lingering concerns over up more complex investments        taking off global clo volumes    the demand for things like clos extraordinary said rick chief investment officer for global fixed income at blackrock   inc.    clos are one of the largest demand sources for the leveraged loan market which has also been booming this year volumes of leveraged loans often used by private equity firms to fund buyouts are on track to surpass their 2007 record according to lcd a unit of s&amp;p global market intelligence at the same time investors have concerns about rising leverage level and weaker creditor protections   within a clo are different risk profiles investors in the most senior aaa rated piece of debt get paid first and are the most insulated from losses if defaults rise in the underlying loan portfolio they also receive the returns slices of debt further down receive higher returns but will suffer losses if defaults spike at the bottom sits the equity tranche the first loss and last to get paid but the highest potential source of returns   a 2014 report from standard amp poor ’s ratings services stated that aaa rated and aa rated clo tranches incurred no losses at all between 1994 and 2013 loss rates for lower rated tranches meanwhile were low just 1.1 for b rated securities over that period        flying high market returns since j.p. morgan recommended buying clos last july    that does n’t prevent some conservative investors from conflating the clos with the now infamous cdos many of which were linked to subprime mortgages and spread and amplified losses in the u.s. housing market one breed of cdos are on a comeback path of their own with more investors returning to them during an aging bull market   many people were burnt by these acronyms from the crisis said head of credit fund management for europe and asia pacific at intermediate capital group he is currently recommending that clients buy senior clo tranches over investment grade bonds   clos like other types of securitizations have been subject to greater regulation since the financial crisis that includes forcing funds that manage a clo to retain 5 of the securities in an effort to align incentives with investors   that has attracted additional capital into the market said mike a principal at alternative investment manager   assets under management in the loan participation sector a proxy for funds that invest in clos have grown 21 this year to $ billion according to thomson reuters   the pickup in clos has been a boon to banks declines in trading revenues in the current low volatility environment revenue from clo related activity at the top 12 global investment banks more than doubled over the first half of 2017 from a year earlier to almost $ 1 billion according to financial consultancy coalition   clo investors have been handsomely rewarded in recent months j.p. morgan strategist recommended clients buy clos last july as he thought they looked too cheap between then and the end of september bb rated clo tranches returned compared with a return for the technology oriented nasdaq stock index according to his calculations   clos have been an absolute home run said mr. though he added such returns are n’t repeatable   analysts say clos got beaten down last year following a series of troubles in the underlying loan market including distress in the energy sector some analysts think the strong rally in clo tranches since then should give investors pause others think the market has further to run   champion head of credit strategies at paris based hedge fund la investment solutions likes aaa rated clo tranches but with a twist leverage   mr. champion says he buys senior european clo tranches and borrows money against them to increase the size of his position between five and 10 times that can amplify gains and losses significantly   the difference between now and a year ago is the availability of leverage he said   bankers say only a small proportion of clo buyers use leverage and emphasize that trades are subject to daily margin calls that means investors have to post cash to cover mark to market losses on a position which in turn limits how much they are willing to borrow   the leverage in the system today is a fraction

if i have a asset a with expected return of 100 and by standard deviation 1 and asset b with expected return of 1 and risk 100 would it be rational to put asset b into the portfolio no because modern portfolio theory would say that if there is another asset b2 with the same or higher return but less risk which you already have in asset a you should invest in that if those are the only two assets you can choose from you would invest completely in asset a. the point of diversification is that so long as two assets are n't perfectly positively correlated meaning that if one moves up the other always moves up then losses in one asset will sometimes be offset by gains in another reducing the overall risk

sure but as a retail client you 'd be incurring transaction fees on entry and exit do you have the necessary tools to manage all the corporate actions too and index rebalances    etf managers add value by taking away the monstrous web of clerical work associated with managing a portfolio of at times hundreds of different names with this comes the value of institutional brokerage commissions data licenses etc i think if you were to work out the actual brokerage cost as well as the time you 'd have to spend doing it yourself you 'd find that just buying the etf is far cheaper   also a bit of a rabbit hole but how would you with traditional retail client tools even coordinate the simultaneous purchase of all 500 components of something like spy i would guess that on average you 're going to have significantly worse slippage to the index than a typical etf provider add that into your calculation too

you seem to have all your financial bases covered and others have given you good financial advice so i will try to give you some non financial ideas the first and most important thing is that you are investing with a long time friend so the dynamics are a lot different that if you had recently met a stranger with an interesting new idea the first thing you need to ask yourself is if your friendship will survive if this thing does n't go well you 've already said you can afford to lose the money so that 's not a worry but will there be any the flip side is also true if the venture succeeds you should be able to go further with it because he 's your friend you know your friend better back to grade school than almost anyone else so here are some things to ask yourself what does your friend have that will give him a chance to succeed tech savvy a winning personality a huge general business savvy something else if your guardian angel had told you that one of your friends was planning to on an internet advertising venture is this the one you would have guessed conversely knowing that your friend was planning to do a start up is this the kind of venture you would have guessed how does internet and advertising fit in with what you are doing if this venture succeeds could it be used to help your professional development and career maybe as a supplier or customer can you see yourself leaving your current job and joining your friend 's now established company as a vice president or acting as a member of its board of directors the latter perhaps while pursuing your current career path   are your other mutual friends investing are some of them more tech savvy than you and better able to judge the company 's prospects of success to a certain extent there is safety in numbers and even if there is n't misery loves company on the upside would you feel left out if everyone in your crowd caught the next microsoft except you

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

j gruber 's consulting reports for the various states minnesota wisconsin etc     and the article it addresses which included some numbers from the reports     note that gruber has made a whole spectrum of claims from initially claiming that premiums would go down for a consulting agreement with the obama administration to later revisions showing significant increases to varying degrees depending on the individuals specific demographic to wit   ’s new reports are in direct contrast obama ’s words and with claims gruber himself made in 2009 then the economics professor said that based on figures provided by the independent congressional budget office health care reform will significantly reduce not increase non group premiums   gt;during his presentation to wisconsin officials in august 2011 gruber revealed that while about 57 percent of those who get their insurance through the individual market will benefit in one way or another from the law ’s an even larger majority of the individual market will end up paying drastically more overall   the application of tax subsidies 59 percent of the individual market will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent gruber reported   gt;the reason for this is that an estimated 40 percent of wisconsin residents who are covered by individual market insurance do n’t meet the affordable care act ’s minimum coverage requirements under the affordable care act they will be required to purchase more expensive plans   for his own explanation for the expected health insurance rate hikes gruber told that his reports reflect the high cost of folding state high risk pools into the federal government 's exchange without using the money the state was already spending to subsidize those high risk pools   note emphasis added     note 2 to begin with an average increase of 31 qualifies as significant hell it 's a lot more than merely significant that 's a huge increase and secondly that is an average meaning that while some of the people in that 59 will probably not see such a high increase a fairly large segment and per the provisions of the act versus current premium calculation methods we know these will be young healthy singles and especially males will face increases that are substantially higher than 31 and in fact will probably be in the nature of double or triple previous premiums as would be required in order to meet another provision of the act that highest premiums for older pool members can not be higher than 3x that of the youngest lowest tier premiums and if the company is to balance the books it can only bring down the one end if it makes a compensating increase at the other end   none of that is rocket science and it is entirely predictable the only things that would be odd would be that anyone should expect anything different and that gruber 's initial claims of across the board lower costs were ever accepted in the first place

bank products have been pretty common with tax refunds as well and they are also being heavily scrutinized for the same reasons   refund anticipation loans have been outlawed for future tax seasons due to lack of consumer protection   what is a bank product you might ask   rather than waiting 7 14 days for the a direct deposit from the irs a lot of places like block and jackson would offer a bank product to get you money quicker   for this service they charge a fee usually $ which is grossly overpriced for how little work it takes but if your refund is several thousand dollars you may not care   a refund anticipation loan was the most predatory bank product as it was an advance on your loan for the amount your expected refund   however if there were any errors in your return and the irs decided your refund was less than what your tax preparer calculated it to be you were stuck with paying back the advance amount leaving you to foot the bill for whatever errors your preparer may have made   these loans also had very high interest rates since usually the people that wanted were also the same people that rely upon cash advances   there are also electronic refund checks which ironically are paper checks for the consumer not electronic deposits direct deposits and prepaid debit cards   despite the fact that these same methods of refund payments are offered by the irs themselves preparers and banks alike sold these to collect fees for essentially no work   i 'm not sure how similar these bank products for student loans are but i wanted to shed some light on them anyways   regardless of how badly you need money do not ever accept money through a bank product   if it benefited you more banks and preparers would not offer these   source   telemarketing at a tax preparation software company

begin having them take community college courses while they are still in high school this should be a better use of time than ap courses if they continue and get an associates degree the credits should be transferrable anywhere take the associates degree to a state school and have them finish just their two years 4 semesters at the state school that should be an non stressful and affordable approach that will give them a time age based advantage over their peers so instead of playing with financial aid and retirement plan rules this sort of goal can help you save without creating inconsequential and unnecessary expectations for yourself or your family

this is because volatility is cumulative and with less time there is less cumulative volatility the time value and option value are tied to the value of the underlying   the value of the underlying stock is quite influenced by volatility the possible price movement in a given span of time   thirty days of volatility has a much broader spread of values than two days since each day benefits from the possible price change of the prior days   so if a stock could move up to + 1 in a day then compounded after 5 days it could be + 5 + 0 or -5   in other words this is compounded volatility less time means far less volatility which is geometric and not linear   less volatility lowers the value of the underlying   see black scholes for more technical discussion of this concept a shorter timeframe until option expiration means there are fewer days of compounded volatility   so the expected change in the underlying will decrease geometrically   the odds are good that the price at days will be close to the price at much more so than the prices at or additionally the time value of an american option is the implicit put value or implicit call   while an american option lets you exercise prior to expiry unlike a european option exercised only at expiry there 's an implicit put option in a call or an implicit call in a put option   if you have an american call option of 60 days and it goes into the money at 30 days you could exercise early   by contract that stock is yours if you pay for it or in a put you can sell whenever you decide in some cases this may make sense if you want an immediate payoff or you expect this is the best price situation but you may prefer to watch the price   if the price moves further your gain when you use the call may be even better   if the price goes back out of the money then you benefited from an implicit put   it 's as though you exercised the option when it went in the money then sold the stock and got back your cash when the stock went out of the money even though no actual transaction took place and this is all just implicit so the time value of an american option includes the implicit option to not use it early   the value of the implicit option also decreases in a nonlinear fashion since the value of the implicit option is subject to the same valuation principles but the larger principle for both is the compounded volatility which drops geometrically

i posted this here because i thought it would get well thought out and intellectual responses save this for r politics responding to your replies to the truth can be simple sure but more often than not it is a shade of gray not a pure simple black or white especially in a field as complex as economics also idea that you should be loyal to objective truth is not diminished if he she does not follow it it is still just as valid a point if he follows his own advice or not

alright i will go through bullet point by bullet point and try to best figure out what you will be doing in layman 's terms please bear in mind that i do not work for a hedge fund but rather a much larger entity so a lot of the work you will be doing is pre populated   = in this role the individual will be the main point of contact for the client on all things related to understanding their trading profit amp loss and how their valuations have been sourced in addition the product controller will work with internal partner areas to ensure all required processes have been performed to verify the valuation accuracy of the client ’s portfolio   from my understanding you will act as the middle man between the client and the analyst as such here is how a real interaction may go client x calls you answer hello 's office how can i assist you client x asks hey i was curious what my capital gains were on my fb purchase ok let me pull up your account just a moment it seems as though your current capital are $ 30,000 lol on your fb purchase   client x hmm well do i have any significant loses that i may be able to sell off to off set the tax on the capital gains why yes you do it seems aapl has taken a mighty tumble would you like to sell a position to assist you in offsetting client x why that would be great thanks for your help the conversation could go on and that is a pretty deep conversation for the level you are going in but i have had conversations like these before the second part of the bullet just means that you will be checking and the grunt work of the analyst and in some places actually performing the grunt work the work will most likely be along the lines of finding returns for different time periods popular desired time periods are inception ytd 1yr etc remember all of these time periods are not good stand alone they must be compared to a relevant benchmark for instance you would not want to compare the barclays intermediate ag to an equity portfolio the most common benchmark for an equity portfolio is going to be the s&amp;p 500 but you have to look at where the portfolio is focused if it is a you may want to look more towards something like the ishares s&amp;p smallcap 600 value index in the end always remember that any number you come up with is always relative to a benchmark a plain return number is useless   skills = knowledge of cash and derivative products across various markets knowledge of pricing and valuation knowledge of profit and loss reporting and related attribution analysis   pretty much they just want to make sure that if a client asks about a forward future contract as well as any swap option that you understand what they are this bullet points i know what i am doing even though nobody knows what is going on in the economy be up on your current events have a personal conjecture about what you feel is going to happen moving forward but do not convey it if you know that the unemployment was the main driver behind today ’s poor market then you will be good for the day because that will suffice for any call in that relates to why is the market down one of my favorite quotes about the current economy is as follows anyone around here who is n't confused about what ’s going on does n't understand as scary as it is that is the honest truth nobody knows what is about to happen and if anyone tells you they do they are lying and you need to run away quickly i am assuming you know how to calculate profit and loss i do n’t really know of a special way to twist the numbers around   duties = managing the daily p&amp;l process for one or more client trading desks o daily review of quality control checks o working with trading on p&amp;l differences inquiries o working with offshore product control team india on qc process o delivering a final daily and month end p&amp;l statement to the client understanding and explaining the key drivers behind the p&amp;l movements preparing managing monthly or more frequently as required price verification process and associated reporting updating and maintaining pricing policy for each financial type that is included in the consultant ’s p&amp;l reporting ad hoc projects to meet and enhance client   all this means is that you will be sending out the due diligence to the client and you will ensure you are using the proper closing price and include any deposits withdrawals during the month into your calculation the main point is knowing the reasons the price moved throughout the day month keep up on current events and make sure that you understand a vast knowledge of economic data   for what your day to day activity may be i can walk you through it let ’s say you get in at 8 am you will get in at 8 read economic data recent news articles until about 10 from there you will update client a f p l worksheet until about noon you will eat a quick lunch until about and continue on the grind of e m until about 4 from 4 5 you will reread what happened at the end of the day and an overall economic activity report for the day you may stay until 8 or 9 if you are in a banking hub nyc but a lot of the older guys will leave at this time this is your time to shine stay as late as you can and pump out as much work as you can   as for your interview they may ask you what will be a good play for the next 6 months to a year you should respond with common themes in the market the most common theme is the dividend growth play a ton of people are not predicting large amount of growth for the next 5 10 years i believe i read something earlier that jpm lowered their growth forecasts by about 30 recently so dividends is the play dividend payers are generally well established companies blue chip that have a strong in their respective industry sector there are a ton of funds out everywhere to follow this trend you could throw out a few funds for brownie points i ’ll give you some and are pretty common i hope this helps and let me know if anything was n’t clear wrote it pretty quickly i am off to have a drink or two or three i ’ll check this in the morning though

the us postal service to my recollection recommends only mailing cash or items with cash like characteristics using registered mail service registered mail is expensive and a pain in the butt for everyone as it requires an audit trail for each individual who touches the mailing   if you 're doing a lot of business and word gets out that you 're accepting cash payments via the mail you 'll probably attract unwanted attention from the tax authorities as well it 's fairly unusual

as a self employed handyman i can tell you this   any work that is done be it professional part time hobby or whatever else has to answer to two primary criteria   as you asked it has to be worthwhile in financial terms and more importantly in personal terms   in the long term charging low rates will her   not worth it someone once said i have no with he who charges cheaply because who better then he knows the value of his services   obviously one has to remain reasonable   then there is an factor in working for yourself   i call it losses since they are extremely difficult to calculate as noted above here already   in the first place they are extremely difficult to detect anyway   micro management will not tell you the losses you can only do it at the end of a period on a balance sheet   then you have to calculate a fair price in terms of lessons given and monies received the trick is to gain a fair assessment of worth to her without her needing to go into the books just as a simple gut feel   she needs to really feel good about it to maintain motivation for the future   otherwise i did it it does not work the other consideration is that when money changes hands it places a benchmark on the tuition and the relationship   one   it locks her into delivering professional work as she already is one   two   the students will be locked into giving fair and excellent commitment in being taught a simple calculation goes like this use the time span of a month as it is easier to break down available time per week   also remember that there will be extra hours spent in consultation with parents   this is a cost it has be calculated difficult at the start but keep track of it   one other thing   i do not give discounts of extend favours but i keep my prices reasonable i was told i am some 25 more expensive than the latest quotes but i kept on getting work with a high execution to quotation rate   floating prices are   impossible to track manage and justify   people talk to each other whether you like it or not   do proper reasonable calculations and be up front to all about how you work   in contract on paper   it just may be necessary to scale prices from beginner to advanced classes ok $ 50 seems a fair price i do n't live in the states but about three four big mac 's would compare about right   you are not selling time you are selling expertise decide how much she wants out of it per month forget retirement you live now   this income will also cover other invisible extraneous work determine how much time will be spent in giving lessons   you can only charge for visible work done basic hourly rate = monthly income lesson hours then there 's a catch   research has shown that owners of one man and small businesses spend about 55 of their time in getting new business   so now charged hourly rate = basic hourly rate divided by 45 this could you but these are hard commercial facts   things could appear to be extremely expensive   you will however have a solid base from which to decide as you go further   the accounting is a good place to start but she you both rather have to feel good about the rewards and the counter performances great success to you both
