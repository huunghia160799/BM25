i can say that i got x dollars from an account like income benefits but where do i credit that money to expenses groceries yes does n't feel right since i never actually spent that money on food   you did did n't you you got food i 'm guessing there 's an established convention for this already   doubt it established conventions in accounting are for businesses and more specifically public companies so you can find a gaap or guidelines on how to book benefits hint salary expense but it is not something you may find useful in your own household accounting do what is most convenient for you since it is a double booking system you need to have an account on the other side expenses groceries does n't feel right add expenses groceries benefits or expenses benefits or whatever when you do your expense and cash flow reports you can exclude both the income and the expense benefits accounts if you track them separately so that they do n't affect your tracking of the real expenses

completely linear   we do n't do that our daughter has a fixed allowance and we expect a certain amount of help around the house as being part of the family   we do n't make any explicit ties between the two and we do n't seem to have any problems we bought an ebay lot of pockets and divided them up into $ 5 bags   this is a better deal that what we could get in the store new   her allowance is n't enough that she can buy one every week after sensing her frustration we gave her the opportunity to earn some more money by doing extra work   it happened to be cleaning up after our dogs in the back yard a chore we had neglected for quite a while   she stuck with the job and truly earned that money   she 'll be six in january   what 's more it was a good deal for me   it needed to be done and i did n't really want to do it so for now this seems like a fair balance   it prevents her from getting the idea that she wo n't work unless she gets paid but she also knows that working harder does have its rewards we still have time to teach her the idea of working smarter this is n't a formal study   it 's just my experience

no   the legislation requires the landlord to deposit it in a bank   check out pages 7 10 of the linked document   there is no mention of interest the second clause i believe is probably for large landlords who hold hundreds of thousands of dollars of security    q4 once collected what must the landlord do with the security deposit    the landlord must either a deposit the money with a regulated financial institution e.g.    bank or b deposit a cash bond or surety bond to secure the entire deposit    with the secretary of state note if the landlord does this he or    she may use the money at any time for any purpose the bond ensures    that there is money available to repay the tenant ’s security deposit

the general rule with stock options is that it 's best to wait until expiration to exercise them   the rationale depends on a few factors and there are exceptions reasons to wait there would be cases to exercise early tax implications should be checked with a professional advisor specific to your situation in the employee stock option plans that i have personally seen you get regular income tax assessed between exercise price and current price at the time you exercise   your tax basis is then set to the current price   you also pay capital gains tax when you eventually sell which will be long or short term based on the time that you held the stock the time that you held the options does not count   i believe that other plans may be set up differently

the main question is how much money you want to make   with every transaction you   should calculate the real price as the price plus costs for example if you but 10 stock of £ 100 each and the transaction cost is £ 20 then the real cost of buying a single share is in fact buying price of stock + broker costs amount bought or £ 104 in this case   now you want to make a profit so calculate your desired profit margin you want to receive a sales price of buying price + profit margin + broker costs amount bought suppose that you 'd like 5 then you 'll need the price per stock of my example to increase to 100 + 5 + £ 40 10 = £ 109   so you it only becomes worth while if you feel confident that 's stock   will rise to that level read the yearly balance of that company to see if they do n't have any debt and are profitable look at their dividend earning history study the stock 's candle graphs of the last ten years or so to find out if there 's no seasonal effects and if the stock performs well overall get to know the company well you should only buy shares after doing your homework   but what about switching to another stock of actually it does n't matter since it 's best to separate transactions sell your 's stock when it has reached the desired profit margin or if it seems it is underperforming cut your losses make the calculations for 's shares without reference to 's and decide like that if it 's worth while to buy

the 5 to 6.5 loan rates are a bit high you 'll probably want to pay those off first and make it one of your priorities as soon as you have a 6-month savings fund this should probably take precedence over savings for retirement unless you 're giving up a 401(k match pay extra on the highest interest loan until it 's all paid off then switch to the next one down and accelerate the payoff as much as you can if you 're looking at a loan at 6 and a payoff date in 8 years or so 2020 am extra dollar paid now will save you not a bad return in general and an excellent return for something that 's zero risk the other loans at 2 3 are different an extra dollar paid now on a 2 loan will save you $ 0.17 over 8 years that 's a pretty mediocre return if you have a good stable job and good job prospects and a decent family support network and few commitments like children and mortgages and a low cost of living generally the things that help you have a high tolerance for risk then you should consider investing your money in the stock market instead of paying off these loans any earlier than you need to broad index funds and the like not individual stocks

i recommend reading what 's the catch in investing in real estate for rent and making a list of expenses   you have a known expense the rent and the assumption that it will rise a bit each year if not each year eventually the landlord will bump it and on average the rent should track inflation   the buy side is the complete unknown especially to us here the mortgage and taxes are just the beginning my ongoing issue in the buy rent debate is that it 's easy to buy too big or at least far bigger that what you are renting   one extreme a couple moves from their one bedroom apartment into their purchased home with far more space than they ever use no need to paint the full picture of numbers the house is a money pit and they live for the house   other end couple already renting a nice sized home and they buy a similar one they rent out the two spare bedrooms for 5 years until they have kids and want their privacy back they bought smart for less than market price and from day one the mortgage was lower than the rent they paid by year 5 having sent the extra income to pay down the mortgage they 've paid down half the loan as the kids come along they refi to a new 30 yr fixed at 3.5 and the payment is tiny compared to the rest of their budget   simply put the ratio of house price to rent for that same house is not a constant when the ratio is high it 's time to rent when it swings very low it 's worth considering a purchase but the decision is never clear until every detail is known the time may be perfect and the day after you close you lose your job or in a good scenario get a raise and are just because you bought low yesterday does n't mean the market will pay you a good price today it takes time for out of whack pricing to come back to normal   a simple question maybe but we first need a lot of details to help you understand what you are considering

this is going to vary from insurer to insurer and likely year to year   typically an insurer will set what it calls the guaranteed rate of return for whole life policies and will allow you to take loans against the cash value of your policy at some adjustment to that rate   also typically you pay the interest back to yourself less some small administrative fee some insurers have whole life policies called something along the lines of an accelerated cash value policy or a high early cash value policy stick to these ones   the commission structure is less favorable to the agent broker but much more of your premium is recognized as cash value earlier the benefit for lack of a better word to taking a loan against your own cash value over taking a loan from a bank is the severely reduced process   there 's no underwriting for your loan like there would be from a bank   if you 're laid off maybe you ca n't get a loan from a bank but you can scoop some money out of your policy on a loan basis or alternatively you can just surrender the policy and take the accrued cash value many people will poo poo the value of whole life but fact of the matter is your underwriting status can change in the course of your life and it 's possible that in the future you wo n't be able to buy any life insurance   there 's nothing wrong with having something permanent to supplement your larger term policies personally i view diversification as having money in a lot of different places   this strategy is probably not as efficient as it could but i do n't like the idea of having all my eggs in one basket   i have cash in a lock box at home cash savings cds a personal loan portfolio bitcoins index funds individual stocks commodity etfs and bond funds spread in traditional 401(k roth ira and regular taxable accounts spread out to 6 different institutions   i do n't personally own any whole life but i 'll probably buy a small policy before my next 6-month birthday i might as well put some money there too   all of this is to say do not put all of your money in a whole life policy and do not buy all of your life insurance needs via whole life

from the times a reader on g.m. ’s bankruptcy q. i own g.m. preferred shares should i be looking to sell them or    hold on i bought them at $ 25 a share when they were issued in late    2001 manhattan a. when a company files for bankruptcy its various stock and    bondholders essentially get in line the first investors to be repaid    are secured debt holders then senior bond investors followed by    subordinated debt holders preferred shareholders are next and    lastly holders of common stock in a bankruptcy preferred shares are usually worthless much like    shares of common stock but in the case of g.m. there may be some    good or at least somewhat better news most of g.m. ’s preferred    shares are actually senior notes or quarterly interest bonds which    means you will be treated as a bondholder according to cohen    president of envision capital management so you will be able to    exchange your for g.m. stock bondholders will receive 10    percent of the new company ’s stock it ’s not the best deal but it    beats the empty bag true preferred shareholders would have been left    holding of course this is just one example and you were hoping to get some larger picture the article stated in a bankruptcy preferred shares are usually worthless much like shares of common stock which at least is a bit closer to that if you accept usually as a statistic

your employment status is not 100 clear from the question   normally consultants are sole proprietors or llc 's and are paid with 1099 's   they take care of their own taxes often with schedule c and they sometimes can but generally do not use employer company 401(k   if this is your situation you can contact any provider you want and set up your own solo 401(k which will have great investment options and no fees   i do this through fidelity if you are paid with a w2 you are not a consultant   you are an employee and must use your employer 's 401(k figure out what you are if you are a consultant open a solo 401(k at the provider of your choice   make sure beforehand that they allow incoming rollovers   roll all of your previous 401(k)s and ira 's into it when you have moved your 401(k to a better provider you wo n't be paying any extra fees but you will not recoup any fees your original provider charged i 'm not sure why you mention a roth ira   if you try to roll your 401(k into a roth instead of a traditional ira or 401(k be aware that you will be taxed on everything you roll edit a little info about ira 's in response to your comment tax advantaged retirement accounts come in two flavors one is managed by your company and the money is taken out of your paycheck   this is usually a 401(k or 403(b   you can contribute up to $ 18 k per year and your company can also contribute to it   the other flavor is an ira   you can contribute $ 5,500 per year to this for you and $ 5,500 for your spouse   these are outside of your company and you make the deposits yourself   you choose your own provider so competition has driven prices way down   you can have both a 401(k and an ira and contribute the max to both though at high incomes you lose the ability to deduct ira contributions these accounts are tax advantaged because you only pay taxes once   with a regular brokerage account you pay income tax in the year in which you earn money then you pay tax every year on dividends and any capital gains that have been realized by selling   there are two types of tax advantaged accounts traditional ira or traditional 401(k   you do not pay income tax on this money in the year you earn it nor do you pay capital gains tax   instead you pay tax only in the year in which you take the money out in retirement roth ira or roth 401(k   you do pay income tax on money on this money in the year in which you earn it   but then you do n't pay tax on any gains or withdrawals ever again when you leave your job and sometimes at other times you can move your money out of a 401(k into your ira where you can do a better job managing it   you can also move money from your ira into a 401(k if your 401(k provider will allow you to whether traditional or roth is better depends on your tax rate now and your tax rate at retirement   however if you choose to move money from a traditional account into a roth account you must pay tax on it in that year as if it was income because traditional and roth accounts are taxed at different times   for that reason if you are just trying to move money out of your 401(k to save on fees the logical place to put it is in a traditional ira moving money from a traditional to a roth may make sense for example if your tax rate is temporarily low this year but that would be a separate decision from the one you are looking at you can always roll your traditional ira into a roth later if that does become the case   otherwise there 's no reason to think your traditional 401(k should be rolled into a roth ira according to what you have described

it is my opinion that part of having a successful long term relationship is being committed to the other person 's success and well being this commitment is a form of investment in and of itself the returns are typically non monetary so it 's important to understand what money actually is money is a token people exchange for favors if i go to a deli and ask for a sandwich i give them tokens for the favor of having received a sandwich the people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors and that 's the entire economy people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors sometimes being invested in your spouse is giving them a back rub when they 've had a hard day the investment pays off when you have a hard day and they give you a back rub sometimes being invested in your spouse is taking them to a for a professional massage the investment pays off when they get two tickets to that thing you love at the small scale it 's easy to mostly ignore minor monetary discrepancies at the large scale which i think £ 50k is plenty large enough given your listed net worth it becomes harder to tell if the opportunity cost will be worth making that investment it pretty much comes down to will the quality of life improvements from that investment be better than the quality of life improvements you receive from investing that money elsewhere as far as answering your actual question of how should i proceed there is n't a one size fits all answer to this it comes down to decisions you have to make such as in theory it 's easy to say that everyone should be able to trust their spouse but in practice there are a lot of people who are very bad at handling money it can be worthwhile in some instances to keep your spouse at an arms length from your finances for their own good such as if your spouse has a gambling addiction with all of that said it sounds like you 're living in a £ 1.5 m house rent free how much of an opportunity cost is that to your wife has she been freely investing in your well being with no explicit expectation of being repaid this can be your chance to provide a return on her investment if it were me i 'd make the investment in my spouse and consider it rent while enjoying the improvements to my quality of life that come with it

when evaluating a refinance you need to figure out the payback time refinancing costs money in closing costs the payback time is the time it takes to recover the closing costs with the amount of money you are saving in interest   for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one   to estimate this look at the difference in interest rate between your mortgage and the new one and your mortgage balance for example let 's say that you have $ 100,000 left on your mortgage and the new rate is 1 lower than your current rate in one year you will save roughly $ 1,000 in interest if your closing costs are $ 2,000 then your payback time is somewhere around 2 years if you plan on staying in this house longer than the payback time then it is beneficial to refinance   there are mortgage refinance calculators online that will calculate payback time more precisely   one thing to watch out for when you refinance if you expand the term of your mortgage you might end up paying more interest over the long term even though your rate is less and your monthly payment is less for example let 's say you currently have 8 years left on a 15-year mortgage if you refinance to a new 15-year mortgage your monthly payment will go down but if you only pay the new minimum payment for the next 15 years you could end up paying more in interest than if you had just continued with your old mortgage for the next 8 years to avoid this refinance to a new mortgage with a term close to what you have left on your current mortgage if you ca n't do that continue paying whatever your current monthly payment is after you refinance and you 'll pay your new mortgage early and save on interest

the calculation is to figure out how many dollars you get in return for the amount of dollars you spend in your case you know you get 1000 points for $ 1000 dollars and can redeem one movie ticket for 1000 points therefore granted that you could also redeem a $ 8 9 ticket making your return 0.8 0.9   in addition this can get more complicated for some points cards that may give out free points and is especially so if there 's an intermediary such as air miles for which points can be earned in numerous ways to get really nitty gritty you could to keep a spreadsheet where you list number of dollars spent number of points gained number of points redeemed and value of reward received thus you can figure out exactly what your cost is for each point second factor from above as well as the ultimate value of each point with respect to rewards redeemed first factor i 'm considering doing that myself since i 'm prone to spreadsheet addiction but this method is likely overkill for most points cards

taking into account that you are in cyprus a euro country you should not invest in usd as the usa and china are starting a currency war that will benefit the euro meaning if you buy usd today they will be worth less in a couple of months as for the way of investing your money look at it like a boat race starting on the 1st of january and ending on the 31st of december each year there are a lot of boats in the water some are small some are big some are whole fleets your objective is to choose the fastest boat at any time if you invest all of your money in one small boat that might sink before the end of the year you are putting yourself at risk say startup capital if you invest all of your money in a medium sized boat you still run the risk of it sinking say stock market stock if you invest all of your money in a the risk of it sinking is smaller and the probability of it ending first in the race is also smaller say a stock of a multinational a fleet is limited by it 's slowest boat but it will surely reach the shore say a fund now investing money is time consuming and you may not have the money to create your own portfolio your own fleet so a fund should be your choice however there are a lot of funds out there and not all funds perform the same   most funds are compared with their index a 3 star morningstar rated fund is performing on par with it 's index for a time period a 4 or 5 star rated fund is doing better than it 's index most funds fluctuate between ratings a 4 star rated fund can be mismanaged and in a number of months become a 2 star rated fund or the other way around but it 's not just luck depending on the money you have available your best bet is to buy a number of star rated managed funds there are a lot of factors to keep into account currency is one geography sector do n't buy for less than € in one fund and do n't buy more than 10 funds stay away from gold unless you want to speculate short term stay away from the usd for now and if you can prevent it do n't put all your eggs in one basket

banks have to disclose up front the annual percentage rate or interest rate that will be charged if you have an outstanding balance on a credit card however the apr of 19.9 is not charged all at once for example if you had a $ 100 dollar balance on your credit card you would not be charged 19.9 interest or making your new balance instead you would be charged the periodic rate which is one month 's interest you can easily calculate the period rate by dividing the apr by 12 so 19.9 equals per month this means if you had a $ 100 balance you would be charged interest or making your new balance ask the bank or look on the website for a document called cardholders agreement if you ca n't find a link ask them for a copy so you can read all the fine print ahead of time

as a canadian resident the simple answer to your question is yes having worked as a tax auditor and as a certified financial planner you are required to file an income tax return because you have taxable employment income all the employer is doing is deducting it at source and remitting it on your behalf that does not alleviate your need to file in fact if you do n't file you will be subject to a no filing penalty the one aspect you are missing is that taxpayers may be entitled to tax credits that may result in a refund to you depending on your personal situation e.g spousal or minor dependents i hope this helps

there are two fundamental flaws to your plan supposing that you can get a loan with an interest rate that is less than the profit you are likely to get from an investment historically the u.s. stock market goes up by 6 to 7 per year i just did a quick check and found rates for unsecured loans of 10 to 15 of course interest rates vary depending on your credit rating and all sorts of other factors but that 's probably a reasonable ball park borrowing money at 15 so you can invest it at 6 is not a good plan of course you could invest in things that promise higher returns but such investments have higher risks if there was a super safe investment that was virtually guaranteed to give 20 profit the bank would n't loan you money at 10 or 15 they 'd put their money in this 20 investment i do n't know what your income is but unless it 's substantial no one is going to give you an unsecured loan for $ 250,000   in your question you say you 'll use $ 2,000 of your profits to make payments on the loan that 's less than 0.8 of the loan amount if you really know a bank that will loan money at 0.8 i 'm sure we 'd all like to hear about it that would be an awesome rate for a fully secured loan never mind for a signature loan $ 250,000 for 10 years at 10 would mean payments of $ 3,300 per month and that 's about the most optimistic terms i can imagine for a signature loan you say you plan to lie to the bank what are you going to tell them a person does n't get to be a bank loan officer with authority to make $ 250,000 loans if he 's a complete idiot they 're going to want to know what you intend to do with the money and how you plan to pay it back if you 're making a million dollars a year sure they 'll probably loan you that kind of money but if you were making a million dollars a year i doubt you 'd be considering this scheme as said in the comments if it was really possible to get bigger returns on an investment than you would have to pay in interest on an unsecured loan then everybody would be doing it all the time sorry if you want to be rich the realistic choices are a arrange to be born to rich parents b win the lottery c get a good job and work hard

you 're missing the point here the goal of ratings firms is not to accurately price debt that 's the market 's job the goal of ratings companies is to evaluate the ability of the company to service their debt instrument much like how the goal of a public accounting firm is to assure that a company 's financial statements follow gaap   the article implicitly makes the assertion that aaa rated securities have pretty low default rates it 's mainly only the area of cdo backed securities that there 's a large disconnect between the rating and default risk while this does raise questions about the worthiness of these ratings and the way they went about modeling and them it hardly suggests that they are wrong over 50 of the time   as a side note why not make it against the law for mutual funds to have rules that allow them to only hold aaa rated securities these funds that demand high credit ratings are only contributing to the conflict of interest by essentially asking for it

consider searching locally for a rewards checking account   there are some that must be opened nationally but you can likely find a local bank or perhaps even two that offer these high yield checking accounts   they will generally pay more than the interest you have on those cards try this site to see if one is offered locally to you these accounts typically require the following   in return you get higher interest rates and most credit you atm fees   the amount is generally capped between 10 k to 25 k on the high interest rate and you 'll generally receive a small rate for anything above that i 'm in a smaller city and i have one local and one within a 45 minute drive   if you have a job that allows for split direct deposits this is even easier   we never have any trouble knocking out the required debit transactions but you must look at the balance as being an emergency fund rather than a checking fund with an available balance   if you find two near you you can probably earn a month in interest   that 's way more than you pay monthly   i vote to put it to work for you before paying it off

you want to take the hit now    there are tons of calculators out there but the rule of 70 should be enough to help convince you assume you can put an extra $ 10k in a 401k now or keep it   if you pay ~30 in taxes you   can have either a $ 7k now or b what $ 10 k will grow to in your 40 years till retirement less taxes at the end the rule of 70 is a quick dirty way to calculate compounded returns   it says that if you divide 70 by your assumed return you get the approximate number of years it will take to double your money    so let 's say you assume a 5 rate of return you can replace that with whatever you want 1 is 14 so you 'll double your $ 10k every 14 years 2 in 40 years you 'll double your money almost 3 times 3 that means you 'll end up with almost $ 80k before taxes 4 even if we assume the same tax rate at retirement of 30 odds are decent it 's lower since you 'll have less income presumably you still have $ 56k whatever you think inflation will be $ 56k later is a lot better than $ 7k now

this is the sad state of us stock markets and regulation t. yes while options have cleared settled for t+1 trade + 1 day for years and now actually clear instantly on some exchanges stocks still clear settle in t+3   there really is no excuse for it if you are in a margin account regulations permit the trading of unsettled funds without affecting margin requirements so your funds in effect are available immediately after trading but are n't considered margin loans   some strict brokers will even restrict the amount of margin funds you can trade with scottrade used to be hyper safe and was the only online discount broker that did this years ago others will allow you to withdraw a large percentage of your funds immediately i think e*trade lets you withdraw up to 90 of unsettled funds immediately if you are in a cash account you are authorized to buy with unsettled funds but you ca n't sell purchases made on unsettled funds until such funds clear or you 'll be barred for 90 days from trading as your letter threatened besides most brokers do n't allow this   you certainly are n't allowed to withdraw unsettled funds by your broker in such an account as it would technically constitute a loan for which you are n't even liable since you 've agreed to no loan contract a margin agreement   i ca n't be sure if that actually violates reg t but when i am i 'll edit while it is true that all marketable options are cleared through one central entity the options clearing corporation with stocks clearing settling still occurs between brokers netting their transactions between each other electronically all financial products could clear settle immediately imo and i 'd rather not start a by giving my opinion why not do n't even get me started on the bond market as to the actual process it 's called clearing settling the general process which can generally be applied to all financial instruments from cash deposits to derivatives trading is the reason why all of the old financial companies were grouped on wall st. is because they 'd have runners physically all of the certificates from building to building   then they discovered netting so slowed down the process to balance the accounts and only cart the net amounts of certificates they owed each other   this is how we get the term bankers hours where financial firms would close to the public early to account for the days trading   while this is all really done instantly behind your back at your broker they 've conveniently kept the short hours

it depends on your definition of inactive if you have credit cards open and do not use them at all for a period of time some lenders will not update your usage to the credit bureaus while some will close your account in which will definitely hurt your credit score but since you use your card once in a while and pay them off you should be good lenders like to see some activity rather than no activity if there are great offers out there by credit card companies then why not take advantage of them the only downside may be the annual fees if there is any but with your credit score it implies you are financially responsible so there should be no compelling financial reason to not open more cards in fact the number of credit accounts you have open can play a role on your score essentially the more the better according to credit karma 0 5 credit accounts is very poor 6 10 is poor 11 20 is good 21 + is excellent

yes becoming a millionaire is a reasonable goal   saving 15 of your income starting at age 25 and investing in the stock market will likely get you there the cagr compound annual growth rate of the s&p 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11 that 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes you may get more or less than that number in the future but let 's guess that you 'll average 9 let 's say that you begin with nothing invested and you start investing $ 100 per week at age 25 if your annual income is $ 35,000 that is about 15 of your income   you decide to invest your money in an s&p 500 index mutual fund 35 years from now when you are 60 years old you would be a millionaire $ 1.2 million actually you may earn less than the assumed 9 depending on how the stock market does   however if you stick with your 15 investment amount throughout your whole career you 'll most likely end up with more because your income will probably increase during your career   and you will probably be working past age 60 giving your investments time to earn even more

banks worry that the large gift might be a loan that is ultimately expected to be repaid if so that affects the cash flow of the recipient and makes it more difficult to make the mortgage payments to the bank   in some cases of course it is an informal loan dad advances a large $ x to son to use as a but does not charge interest and the expectation is that the money will be returned in smaller chunks as and when the son can afford to repay dad    in some cases dad truly means it as a gift but son feels an obligation to repay the money if not explicitly then by paying for the first few months of dad 's nursing home stay etc   so banks like to have an explicit document such as a copy of a letter from dad saying that this money is a gift and some assurance that this is on the up and up    if the amount is larger than the maximum gift that can be given each year without having to file a gift tax return then some assurance that a gift tax return will be filed is helpful mentioning this in the letter is good it indicates that there are no secret or secret agreements to the effect that this is in fact a loan with or without regular repayments

when trading forex each currency is traded relative to another so when shorting a currency you must go long another currency vs the currency you are shorting it seems a little odd and can be a bit confusing but here is the explanation that wikipedia provides an example of this is as follows let us say a trader wants to trade    with the us dollar and the indian rupee currencies assume that the    current market rate is usd 1 to and the trader borrows    with this he buys usd 2 if the next day the conversion rate becomes    usd 1 to then the trader sells his usd 2 and gets he    returns and keeps the profit minus fees so in this example the trader is shorting the rupee vs the dollar does this article add up all other currency crosses to get the net figure so they do n't care what it is depreciating against this data is called the commitment of traders cot which is issued by the commodity futures trading commission cftc   in the wsj article it is actually referring to forex futures in an another article from it explains a bit clearer as to how a news organization comes up with these type of numbers according to the cftc cot data and calculations by reuters which calculates the dollar positions against the euro british pound japanese yen australian dollar canadian dollar and the swiss franc so this article is not talking about futures but it does tell us they got data from the cot and in addition reuters added additional calculations from adding up x currency positions no subscription needed speculators pile up largest net dollar long position since june 2010 cftc here is some additional reading on the topic if you 're interested cftc commitment of the traders data cot report forex what is it and how does it work futures vs. forex options forex wiki

dan 's link he deleted his answer btw is fine it showed the components of the score fico offers   each input has data behind it a bell curve of the behaviors and risk of the person behind it for example we 've discussed utilization many time here the ideal utilization is not 0 but 1 19 this does not mean paying interest or carrying charges from month to month   say i had just one card with a $ 10 k limit i 'd want to be sure i never ran a bill above $ 2000 if i did i 'd see a slight drop in my score and next month it would go back to normal in my case i have enough available credit that going over 20 is rare and if it happened i 'd pay the bill down before the bill was issued just make a mid cycle payment   fico decided that those who go over 20 have a higher risk of default and it gets higher as it goes up same with every aspect of the score 's components   you are comparing us to non us use in the us it seems far more common to use our cards in my family 's case we use very little cash and run most of our spending through our cards   as far as the david is concerned one should separate those who carry a balance from those who pay in full the pay in full users are better off for their habits and responsible card use in the us it 's not easy to rent a car or book a hotel with no card cards offer a cash rebate that adds up fast and purchase protection from fraudulent vendors they also offer extended warranty coverage   the david and others claim that studies prove those using cards spend 10 15 more than cash buyers this is a proven fact from scientific studies only they do n't exist the best i 've seen proves that college kids given a $ 20 bill spend more carefully than those given a $ 20 credit card this does n't extrapolate to a family budget and never will but that quote has a way of being repeated as fact yes it 's non sense thank you for reading and quoting my blog i recognize the quote   the report also shows accounts that have gone to collection an electric bill is n't a regularly reported item it 's assumed your lights are on but if you stop paying the bill and they send your account to a collection agency you 'll see it hit your report   in response to the comment below journal of experimental psychology applied article titled monopoly money the effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior runs 13 pages but on the first page offers do consumers spend differently when using one payment mode relative to another mode for example do consumers spend more when they receive $ 50 in the form of a gift card than in the form of cash if indeed they do then why this research addresses these issues   $ 50 a $ 50 gift card is a nuisance i try to use it up within hours of getting one as i stated above the behavior of a person with such a card does n't scale to a many thousand per month budget such articles in my opinion are nonsense proving nothing   unfortunately this is a bit of a tangent to the original question and if i put up a stand alone is it a fact that people spend more if using a card than cash the question would result in being closed as one that 's seeking opinions not facts

the thing about the glide path is that the closer you 're to the retirement age the less risk you should be taking with your investments all investments carry risk but if you invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 20 and lose all your retirement money it will not have the same effect on your retirement as if you 'd invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 65 and then lose all your retirement money static allocation throughout your life without changing the risk factor will lead you to a very conservative investment path which would mean you 're not likely to lose your investments but you 're not likely to gain much either the point of the glide path is to allow you taking more risks early with more chances of higher gains but to limit your risks down the road also limiting your potential gains that is why it is always suggested to start your retirement funds early in your life to make sure you have enough time to invest in potentially high return stocks with high risk but when you get close to your retirement age it is advised to do exactly the opposite the date targeted funds do that for you but you can do it on your own as well as to the academic research you do n't need to go that far just look at the graphs to see that over long period investments in stocks give much better return than conservative bonds and treasuries especially when averaging the investments as it usually is with the retirement funds but over a given short period investments in stocks are much more likely to significantly lose in value

step one contact the collection agency tell them that they have the wrong person and the same name is just a coincidence i would not give them my correct social security number birth date or other identifying information this could be a total scam for the purpose of getting you to give them such personal identifying information so they can perform an identity theft even if it is a legitimate debt collection agency if they are and/or incompetent they may enter your identifying information into their records oh you say your social security number is n't 123 45 but 56 thank you let me update our records now sir i see that the social security number in our records matches your social security number step two if they do n't back off contact a lawyer collection agencies work by call it intimidation or moral persuasion depending on your viewpoint years after my wife left me she went bankrupt a collection agency called me demanding payment of her debts before the bankruptcy went through i noticed two things about this one we were divorced and i had no responsibility for her debts somehow they tracked down my new address and phone number a place where she had never even lived why should i pay her debts i had no legal obligation nor did i see any moral obligation two their pitch was that she i should pay off this debt before the bankruptcy was final why would anyone do that the whole point of declaring bankruptcy is so you do n't have to pay these debts they were hoping to her into paying even though she would n't be legally obligated to pay if you do n't owe the money of course there 's no reason why you should pay it if they continue to pursue you for somebody else 's debt in the u.s. you can sue them for harassment there are all sorts of legal limits on what collection agencies are allowed to do actually even if they do back off it might be worth contacting a lawyer i suspect that asking your employer to garnish your wages without a court order without even proof that you are responsible for this debt is a tort that you could sue them for

generally speaking the lower credit score trumps   in the case you cite the lower credit score will prevail   however you may need to do exactly that in order to qualify for the loan income wise    there are two factors when obtaining a mortgage really all loans but more so with a mortgage   the to repay credit score   and your ability to service the debt   this last one is a combination of income and debt to income ratio if you do n't have enough income to qualify for the loan or fail to meet the debt to income ration you may have to use your gf 's income to qualify despite her poor credit you might want to see past posts about buying property with non spouses   it could work but generally it requires a lot of legal work before closing on the deal   avoiding this will lead to tales of woe

this is going to be a philosophical answer but here it goes   what is the purpose of an insurance in my perspective insurance is a way to protect yourself from risks in life you can not afford to take following this principle most of the people do not have enough money to fix a ferrari or pay the medical expenses of a third party so insurance against liabilities makes financial sense but many can afford buying an equivalent car as they are insuring   if you have enough money to buy an equivalent car you are paying for a risk you can take yourself then instead of paying the comprehensive fee which is used to pay the different accidents the company 's administrative fees and the shareholder profits i would save your money in a separate account and use it as a self insurance that is at least what i do   i even put other insurances and extended warranties which respective risks i have decided to that way i diversify my fund

from although pharmacy coverage is an optional benefit under federal medicaid law all states currently provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to all categorically eligible individuals and most other within their medicaid programs this is related to the medicaid drug rebate program which offsets the federal and state costs of most outpatient prescription drugs to medicaid patients approximately 600 drug manufacturers currently participate in this program all fifty states and the district of columbia cover prescription drugs under the medicaid drug rebate program i ca n't give you any specific details about patient assistance programs but links to information about various patient assistance programs and general information about medicaid 's and medicare 's prescription drug offerings it 's conceivable that you may be eligible for a patient assistance program but not medicaid for all i know the reverse may be true but it 's difficult to tell without contacting the specific company some patient assistance programs only apply to generic versions of the drug while some state medicaid programs will pay for brand names obviously this varies from state to state

like others have already said it may cause an immediate dip due to a large and sudden move in shares for that particular stock however if there is nothing else affecting the company 's financials and investors perceive no other risks it will probably bounce back a bit but not back to the full value before the shares were issued why whenever a company issues more stock the new shares dilute the value of the current shares outstanding simply because there are now more shares of that stock trading on the market the earnings per share eps ratio will drop since the same profit and company value has to be spread across more shares example   if a company is valued at $ 100 dollars and they have 25 shares outstanding then the eps ratio equates to $ 4 per share = 4   if the company then issues more shares stock to employees who sell or keep them let 's say 25 more shares then shares outstanding increase to 50 but the company 's value still remains at $ 100 dollars eps now equates to $ 2 per share = 2 now sometimes when shareholders especially employees and especially employees who just received them suddenly all sell their shares this causes a micro panic in the market because investors believe the employees know something bad about the company that they do n't other common shareholders then want to dump their holdings for fear of impending collapse in the company this could cause the share price to dip a bit below the new diluted value but again if no real immediate risks exist the price should go back up to the new diluted value example 2 if eps was at $ 4 before issuing more stock and then dropped to $ 2 after issuing new stock the micro panic may cause the eps to drop below $ 2 and then soon rebound back to $ 2 or more when investors realize no actual risk exists after the dilution phase plays out the eps could actually even go above the pre issuing value of $ 4 because investors may believe that since more stock was issued due to good profits more profits may ensue hope that helps

i am going to break rank slightly with the consensus so far   here 's the deal it probably does help your credit slightly to pay it multiple times per month if it is n't a hassle but the bump is likely to be minimal and very temporary   here 's why a key component of your score is your credit usage ratio that is the ratio of how much of your credit limits you are using you want to keep this number down as low as possible now here is where it gets tricky although you have a grace period to pay off your card with no interest the credit card companies do n't generally report the balance as of the due date they either report the high balance or an average balance over the month that is it is based on how much you use not how much balance you carry over each month it is n't very intuitive but that 's just how it is so technically keeping that balance lower over the course of the month will probably help you but the credit usage ratio is generally a rolling average over the last x months so the effect will wear off quickly so it is probably not worth doing unless you know you are going to apply for a loan in the next 6 months and need a temporary small bump another consideration is that paying early provides no real financial benefit in terms of finance charges but you are giving up liquidity which does have some value     1 you probably could get at least a little interest for keeping the money in your account a few more weeks 2 if you have a major financial emergency e.g. broken down car you might appreciate the fact that you kept your options open to carry that balance over a month

you should absolutely go for it and i encourage you to look for multi unit up to 4 properties if there are any in your area   with unit properties it is far more common than not that the other units pay the mortgage to comment on your point about slowly building an asset if the renter covers the payment that 's true but you 're also missing the fact that you get to write off the interest on your income taxes that 's another great benefit if you intend to make a habit out of being a landlord i highly encourage you to use a property management company   most charge less than 10 and will handle all of the tough stuff for you like   fielding sob stories from tenants evicting tenants finding new tenants checking to make sure the property is maintained   it 's worth it there fees are also tax deductible it makes a boat load of sense   just look at the world around you   how many wealthy people rent   i 've met one but they own investment properties though

once a currency loses value it never it period granted there have been short term periods of deflation as well as periods where due to relative value fluctuation a currency may temporarily gain value against the u.s. dollar or euro franc whatever but the prospect of a currency that 's lost 99.99 of its value will reclaim any of that value is an impossibility currency is paper it 's not stock it 's not a hard commodity it has no intrinsic value and no government in history has ever been motivated to re value its currency mind you there have been plenty of reverse splits where a government will knock off the extraneous zeroes to make handling units of the currency more practical

if you receive a 1099-misc from youtube that tells you what they stated to the irs and leads into most tax preparation software guided interviews or wizards as a topic for you to enter   whether or not you have a 1099-misc this discussion from the irs is pertinent to your question you could probably elect to report the income as a royalty on your copyrighted work of art on schedule e but see this note in most cases you report royalties in part i of schedule e form 1040 however if you are in business as a self employed writer inventor artist etc report your income and expenses on schedule c or schedule c ez form 1040 whether reporting on schedule e or c is more correct or better for your specific circumstances is beyond the advice you should take from strangers on the internet based on a general question however know that there are potentially several paths for you    note that this is revenue from a business so if you paid for equipment or services that are 100 dedicated to your pc upgraded broadband video editing software vehicle miles to a shoot props etc then these are a combination of depreciable capital investments and expenses you can report against the income reducing the taxes you may owe   if the equipment services are used for business and personal use there are further guidelines from the irs as to estimating the split these apply whether you report on sch e sch c or sch c ez     quote self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer fees received for babysitting and lawn cutting are all examples of taxable income even if each client paid less than $ 600 for the year someone who repairs computers in his or her spare time needs to report all monies earned as self employment income even if no one person paid more than $ 600 for repairs

with your income so high your marginal tax rate should be pretty easy to determine   you are very likely in the 33 tax bracket married filing jointly income range of $ to $ so your wife 's additional income will effectively be taxed at 33 plus 15 for self employment taxes rounding to 50 means you need to withhold $ over the year or slightly less depending on what business expenses you can deduct you could use a similar calculation for ca state taxes you can either just add this gross additional amount to your withholdings or make an estimated tax payment every quarter   any difference will be made up when you file your 2017 taxes so long as you withhold 100 of your total tax liability from last year you should not have any underpayment penalties

an option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy or sell the underlying so you do n't have to exercise you can just let the option expire so long it does n't have an automatic expiry after expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays an option has two values associated with it time value and exercise value far out of the money when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side options only have time value whereas deep in the money options as yours seems to be has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy sell at a low high price and then sell buy the underlying   the time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move further in your favour and make you more money at expiry as expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no up to now what i have said applies to both otc and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower on the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds if these are european style options which sounds likely and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money they have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying if i am not correct in my excise style assumption european i may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money

this is such a common question here and elsewhere that i will attempt    to write the world 's most answer to this question hopefully    in the future when someone on asks how to split up    the ownership of their new company you can simply point to this    answer the most important principle fairness and the perception of    fairness is much more valuable than owning a large stake almost    everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong and one of    the biggest things that can go wrong is huge angry shouting matches    between the founders as to who worked harder who owns more whose    idea was it anyway etc that is why i would always rather split a new    company 50 50 with a friend than insist on owning 60 because it was    my idea or because i was more experienced or anything else why    because if i split the company 60 40 the company is going to fail    when we argue ourselves to death and if you just say to heck with    it we can never figure out what the correct split is so let 's just    be and go 50 50 you 'll stay friends and the company will    survive thus i present you with joel 's totally fair method to divide up the    ownership of any startup for simplicity sake i 'm going to start by assuming that you are not    going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside    investors later i 'll explain how to deal with venture capital but    for now assume no investors also for simplicity sake let 's temporarily assume that the founders    all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at    the same time later i 'll explain how to deal with founders who do    not start at the same time here 's the principle as your company grows you tend to add people in    layers the top layer is the first founder or founders there may be 1 2 3    or more of you but you all start working about the same time and you    all take the same risk quitting your jobs to go work for a new and    unproven company the second layer is the first real employees by the time you hire    this layer you 've got cash coming in from somewhere investors or    customers doesn't matter these people did n't take as much risk    because they got a salary from day one and honestly they did n't    start the company they joined it as a job the third layer are later employees by the time they joined the    company it was going pretty well for many companies each layer will be approximately one year long    by the time your company is big enough to sell to google or go public    or whatever you probably have about 6 layers the founders and    roughly five layers of employees each successive layer is larger    there might be two founders five early employees in layer 2 25    employees in layer 3 and 200 employees in layer 4 the later layers    took less risk ok now here 's how you use that information the founders should end up with about 50 of the company total each of the next five layers should end up with about 10 of the    company split equally among everyone in the layer example two founders start the company they each take 2500 shares there are    5000 shares outstanding so each founder owns half they hire four employees in year one these four employees each take    250 shares there are 6000 shares outstanding they hire another 20 employees in year two each one takes 50 shares    they get fewer shares because they took less risk and they get 50    shares because we 're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up by the time the company has six layers you have given out 10,000    shares each founder ends up owning 25 each employee layer owns 10    collectively the earliest employees who took the most risk own the    most shares make sense you do n't have to follow this exact formula but the basic    idea is that you set up stripes of seniority where the top stripe    took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least and each    stripe shares an equal number of shares which magically gives    employees more shares for joining early a slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority your top    stripe is the founders below that you reserve a whole stripe for the    fancy ceo that you recruited who insisted on owning 10 the stripe    below that is for the early employees and also the top managers etc    however you organize the stripes it should be simple and clear and    easy to understand and not prone to arguments now that we have a fair system set out there is one important    principle you must have vesting preferably 4 or 5 years nobody    earns their shares until they 've stayed with the company for a year a    good vesting schedule is 25 in the first year 2 each additional    month otherwise your co founder is going to quit after three weeks    and show up 7 years later claiming he owns 25 of the company it    never makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting this is an    extremely common mistake and it 's terrible when it happens you have    these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for    five years and then you discover there 's some jerk that quit after    two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25 of the company for his two    weeks of work now let me clear up some little things that often complicate the    picture what happens if you raise an investment the investment can come from anywhere an angel a vc or someone 's dad basically the    answer is simple the investment just dilutes everyone using the example from above we 're two founders we gave ourselves    2500 shares each so we each own 50 and now we go to a vc and he    offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the    company 1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares so you make another 2500 shares    and give them to the vc he owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd that 's    all there is to it what happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary a lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money    saved up so she decides to go without a salary for a while while the    other founder who needs the money takes a salary it is tempting    just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up    for it the trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount    of shares to give this is just going to cause conflicts do n't    resolve these problems with shares instead just keep a ledger of how    much you paid each of the founders and if someone goes without    salary give them an iou later when you have money you 'll pay them    back in cash in a few years when the money comes rolling in or even    after the first vc investment you can pay back each founder so that    each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the    company should n't i get more equity because it was my idea no ideas are pretty much worthless it is not worth the arguments it would cause to    pay someone in equity for an idea if one of you had the idea but you    both quit your jobs and started working at the same time you should    both get the same amount of equity working on the company is what    causes value not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower what if one of the founders does n't work full time on the company then they 're not a founder in my book nobody who is not working full    time counts as a founder anyone who holds on to their day job gets a    salary or ious but not equity if they hang onto that day job until    the vc puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full    time they did n't take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive    equity along with the first layer of employees what if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods patents domain names etc to the company great pay for that in    cash or ious not shares figure out the right price for that computer    they brought with them or their clever word processing patent and    give them an iou to be paid off when you 're doing well trying to buy    things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality    arguments and unfairness how much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees that depends on market conditions realistically if the investors end    up owning more than 50 the founders are going to feel like    and lose motivation so good investors do n't get greedy    that way if the company can bootstrap without investors the founders    and employees might end up owning 100 of the company interestingly    enough the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between    investors and founders employees an old rule of thumb was that at ipo    time when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as    you were going to raise the investors would have 50 and the    founders employees would have 50 but with hot internet companies in    2011 investors may end up owning a lot less than 50 conclusion there is no one size fits all solution to this problem but anything    you can do to make it simple transparent straightforward and    above all fair will make your company much more likely to be    successful the above awesome answer came from the stack exchange beta site for startups which has now closed i expect that this equity distribution question which is strongly tied to personal finance will come up more times in the future so i have copied the content originally posted   all credit for this excellent answer is due to joel a for the startups se beta site and co founder of stack exchange

how do we define worth to stock traders and some investors it has value either as a transaction or as a piece in an asset allocation strategy is is likely to generate long term revenues and profits that reflect the historical relationship between those factors and stock price performance unlikely   it might be a good short term play for the nimble investor but the real test of worth will be after the initial hype dies down it is what happens to the stock 90 days after it goes public that matters for the long term forgetting contributions to society knowledge and culture the markets will at that point make their determination about value

well for starters you want to rent it for more than the apartment costs you   aside from mortgage you have insurance and maintenance costs   if you are going to have a long term rental property you need to make a profit or at a bare minimum break even   personally i would not like the break even option because there are unexpected costs that turn break even into a severe loss basically the way i would calculate the minimum rent for an apartment i owned would be payment + + other costs you provide + expected annual maintenance costs 100 + of profit i want to make this is a business arrangement   unless you are some of your losses in another manner then it is bad business to maintain a business relationship that is costing you money   the only thing that may be worth considering is what comparable rentals go for in your area   you may be forced to take a loss if the rental market in your area is depressed   but i suspect that right now your condo is renting at a steal of a rate   i would also suspect that the number you get from the above formula falls pretty close to what the going rate in your area is

if you do n't track the accrued costs involved then it means that the valuation of the deal will be somewhat arbitrary but it still can be made by looking at the value of equivalent or similar goods or services it 's rather similar to accounting treatment of gifts for example you make up a valuation and as there are obvious tax reasons to make it as low as possible the valuation should be justifiable or you risk the of irs if you sell the same goods or services for cash then the value of the barter deal is obvious if this barter is the only time you 're handling this particular type of goods a wholesale price of similar items either of your items or the items that you 're receiving in barter could work

if you really believe in the particular stocks then do n't worry about their daily price   overall if the company is sound and presumably paying a dividend then you 're in it for the long haul notwithstanding that it is reasonable to look for a way out   the two you describe are quite different in their specifics selling sounds like the simpler of the two but the trigger event and if it is automatic or manual matters   if you are happy to put in a sell order at some time in the future then just go ahead with that many brokers can place a stop order that will trigger on a certain price threshold being hit   do note however that by default this would place a market order and depending on the price that breaks through in the event of a flash crash depending on how fast the brokers systems were you could find yourself selling quite cheaply a stop limit order will place a limit order at a triggered price   this would limit your overall downside loss but you might not sell at all if the market is really running away options are another reasonable way to deal with the situation sort of like insurance   in this case you would likely buy a put which would give you the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at the price the that was specified in the option   in this case no matter what you are out the price of the option itself hence my to insurance but if the event never happens then that was the price you paid to have that peace of mind i can not recommend a specific course of action but hopefully that fleshed out the options you have

the most important thing is not to tell yourself i 'll save more later in my career when i have more disposable income because of two factors 1 you will get raises over your career but unless you make it big it will never really feel like you have extra money you may double or triple your salary over a career but it usually happens in small increments which your lifestyle tends to adjust upwards to meet even though it does n't feel like it 2 later in your career you may have more money to save but now the commodity you have is time your total savings at retirement are going to be influenced in a massive way by both of these factors a good strategy is save something early in your career even if it feels like an insignificant amount then save larger amounts later in your career when you are earning more but have less time for your investments to grow and less tolerance for high risk high growth investments

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

rebalancing a portfolio helps you reduce risk sell high and buy low i 'll use international stocks and large cap us stocks   they both have ups and downs and they do n't always track with each other international might be up while large cap us stocks are down and vice versa if you started with 50 international and 50 large cap stocks and 1 year later you have 75 international and 25 large cap stocks that means that international stocks are doing relatively well to large cap stocks     comparing only those two categories large cap stocks are on sale relative to international stocks    now move so you have 50 in each category and you 've realized some of the gains from your international investment sell high and added to your large cap stocks buy low the reason to rebalance is to lower risk    you are spreading your investments across multiple categories to manage risk    if you do n't rebalance you could end up with 95 in one category and 5 in another which means 95 of your portfolio is tied to the performance of a single asset category i try to rebalance every 12 months and usually get it done by every 18 months   i like being a hands off long term investor and this has proven often enough to beat the s&p500

i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer but would like to add a few additional points to consider    turbotax and the professional it will send to represent you in case of a tax audit   have no more information about your tax return than what you entered into the program   now there are three or four different kinds of audits    the correspondence audit is the most common kind where irs sends a letter requesting copies of documents supporting a deduction or tax credit that you have claimed representation is hardly necessary in this case    the office audit is more serious where you have to make an appointment and go to the local irs office with paperwork that the examining agent needs to see physically and to answer questions etc   it would be better to be accompanied by a representative at these meetings but office audits are not as common as correspondence audits and because they are expensive for the irs usually occur when the irs is fairly sure of recovering a substantial sum of money   if you have been cutting corners and pushing the envelope in taking large enough deductions to make it worthwhile for the irs to go after you you probably should not have been using turbotax to file your income tax return   but should have been using an accountant or tax preparer who would be   representing you in case of an audit if the reason that you used turbotax   is that no accountant was willing to prepare a tax return with the deductions   that you wished to claim i doubt that having turbotax 's representative with you when you go to the irs office will help you all that much an example of a field audit is when the irs agent comes to your home to see if you actually have a space set aside to use exclusively as your home office as you claimed you did etc a taxpayer compliance measurement program audit is where the   irs randomly chooses returns for statistical checks that taxpayers are complying with the regulations the taxpayer has to prove every line of the return you claim to be filing as married filing jointly bring in your marriage certificate   submit birth certificates and social security cards of your dependent children and so on   yes having turbotax represent you for only $ will help but not if you are not married and can not provide the irs with a marriage certificate etc so pay the fee for peace of mind if you like and as insurance as littleadv suggests   but be sure you understand what you might be getting for the   money   most tax returns selected for audit are selected for what the irs believes are good reasons not at random   if what you said if my tax return is randomly selected for audit they will represent me   is interpreted literally turbotax will represent you only if your return is selected for examination under the program not if it is selected for audit because the irs believes that something is fishy about your return   and as always you get what you pay for

without more info to go on such as a screenshot of the relevant portion of the statement or what country you 're in i will run with the answer that balance is the amount the collection agency is attempting to collect from you including any and all fees the agency may have added one important idea to keep in mind is that depending on how old the debt is the amount involved and the importance to the agency to collect it you may be able to negotiate a settlement for less than the full amount   this is n't always possible but sometimes you get lucky and it does n't hurt to try collection agencies work in several ways   some will actually buy the outstanding debt from the original creditor for some percentage of the debt 's face value and then take their chances on whether they collect anything at all while others work on behalf of the creditor and earn some percentage of what they manage to recover   in the latter case your chance of negotiating a reduced amount is better because the agency is being evaluated by the creditor on how quickly and efficiently they collect debts   an agency that is slower or less effective than another is less likely to continue earning the creditor 's business i hope this helps good luck

you make several good points   i 'll start with black scholes the arbitrage argument in black scholes is between the option and a hypothetical and portfolio with identical cash flows the replicating portfolio   we then value the replicating portfolio via an equilibrium model   when you use bs there is n't necessarily any observed security whose is guaranteed not imply some arbitrage opportunity because bs makes no reference to observed prices   a no arbitrage modification might look like this i observe the prices and implied volatilities of some options and use the implied volatilities to price another option maybe with a different strike   doing so ensures that there is no arbitrage between my price and the market prices implied by my model   realistically the problem arbitrage free models are addressing is that our models and assumptions are wrong even though they 're reasonable a lot of the time   a no arbitrage model removes some set of obvious deficiencies but at the cost of not being able to explain why things are priced as they are   so for instance wo n't reproduce the observed term structure and hull white fixes this but hull white does n't explain where the term structure comes from i.e. what the term structure should be

i am interested in seeing what happens to your report after you test this but i do n't think it 's possible in practice would not affect your credit score and also would n't be worth it for you to carry a negative balance like that having a -1 credit utilization essentially means that you are lending the credit card company money which is n't really something that the credit card companies do they would likely not accept an agreement where you are providing the credit to them having credit is a more formal agreement than just i paid you too much this month even if your payment does post before the transaction and it says you have a negative balance and gets reported to the credit bureau like that this would probably get flagged for human review and a negative credit utilization does n't really reflect what is happening credit utilization is how much do you owe amount of credit available to you and it 's not really correct to say that you owe negative dollars carrying a negative balance like that is money that could be invested elsewhere my guess is that the credit card company is not paying you the apr of your card on the amount they owe you if they are please provide the name of your card they probably do n't pay you anything for that negative balance and it 's money that 's better used elsewhere even if it does benefit your credit score you 're losing out on any interest each month you could have earned with that money to get maybe 1 2 better rate on your next home or car loan when will that be   tldr i think credit utilization approaches a limit at 0 because it 's based on the amount you owe and you do n't really owe negative dollars i am very interested in seeing the results of this experiment please update us when you find out

i will add one thought on to this thread   this is a financial concept called net present value   in plain english it means what 's the best use for your money right now so let 's say you have an extra € 300/month which is not being spent on living expenses if you leave that money under your pillow or spend it on beer or fancy electronics instead of paying off your early that is costing you per month every month   so € or €   this is cumulative for the life of your loan   so not paying € 300 this month will ultimately cost you € 120 assuming you keep the loan open for 10 years   if you 're saying pay my debts or spend the money on a smartphone the answer is that you should pay your debts now here 's the important part   let 's suppose you have a better use for the money than beer or electronics   let 's suppose you have a mutual fund which will reliably provide you with a return of 10 a year if you put that € 300/month into a high yield fund and if the returns are consistent you are still paying that € because you invested elsewhere and did n't pay your debts but you are realizing profits of on the invested money   € 2.5 which is a net gain   so in some cases paying off your debt may not be the best use of your money there are a number of other questions involved which are related to your exposure to capital gains taxes incentives or disincentives for holding debt c. c.   these are generally country specific   a poster above who seems to be familiar with netherlands law did a good explanation of some of those incentives   i 'm in the us and our incentive and disincentive system is different tl;dr   it depends

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

i hate to point to wikipedia as an answer but it does describe exactly what you are looking for the s&p 500 is a free float    capitalization weighted index    published since 1957 of the prices of    500 large cap common stocks actively    traded in the united states the    stocks included in the s&p 500 are    those of large publicly held companies    that trade on either of the two    largest american stock market    exchanges the new york stock exchange    and the nasdaq the components of the s&p 500 are    selected by committee the committee    selects the companies in the s&p 500    so they are representative of the    industries in the united states    economy in addition companies that    do not trade publicly such as those    that are privately or mutually held    and stocks that do not have sufficient    liquidity are not in the index the s&p is a capitalization weighted index   if a stock price goes up then it comprises more of the total index   if a stock goes down it comprises less and if it goes down too much the committee will likely replace it so to answer your question if one stock were to suddenly skyrocket nothing would happen beyond the fact that the index was now worth more and that particular stock would now make up a larger percentage of the s&p 500 index

treasury stock is not really represented in the balance sheet as a treasury stock line item in the assets   some companies will break out treasury shares as a line item in the shareholders equity heading of the balance sheet but apple it in the shares issued and outstanding counts under the shareholders equity heading   as of the most recent q2 2017 quarterly report there are shares issued against shares outstanding   this indicates that apple is retaining about shares in treasury on the q1 10-q you can see that apple had shares issued which indicates roughly 49 mm shares were repurchased by the end of q2   you can roughly verify this by looking at page 18 of the q2 filing in the summary of the share repurchase program   repurchased as part of an accelerated share repurchase arrangement between quarters but from february 2017 through may 2017 there have been 17.5 mm shares repurchased   31 mm shares were also repurchased on the open market in q2     the shares issued total is on a downward trend as part of apple 's share repurchase initiative that has been underway for the last couple of years

here are the reasons i did not lease my current car when you lease you 're tied in at a monthly payment for 48 months or more the only way to get out of that payment is to transfer the lease or buy out the lease if you buy finance you can always sell the car or trade it in to get out of the payments or you can pay down more of the vehicle to lower the payments most leases calculate the cost of leasing based on the residual value of the vehicle often these values are far lower than the actual worth of the vehicle if you owned it for those months and sold it yourself so when you do the math the lease costs you more with today 's low financing rates

the thing about this is that it is n’t one or two big decisions it ’s the thousands of smaller decisions   it ’s the choice not to fund cost saving projects because spending cash looks bad this second it ’s not filling critical individual contributor roles and having too many levels of management   i can give you plenty of examples that show death by 1000 cuts but i think the best example is this   internal projects in general need to be completed within the same calendar year any money that you do not spend in 2017 will not be there for you in 2018 so there is a mad rush in the beginning of the year to spend money and by september all the cash has been used up productivity takes a big hit and a significant amount of effort is spent for next years funding    ge is a financial company that makes things it ’s run by accountants not by logic

coming from an area that is hurricane prone and seeing what happens to local businesses during power outages gas shortages i think what you already have on hand should be sufficient and it sounds like that 's exactly what you 're budgeting for   i 'd say 2 weeks worth of fuel and food costs with the budget for each in line with riding out a natural disaster true would say keep your money in gold buried in the backyard surrounded by land mines but that 's not perhaps what you 're looking for it is not uncommon for gas stations and grocery stores to revert to cash only sales especially if they 're not big chain operations if the internet is out or power is spotty they may not be able to process ccs again think smaller or more rural businesses i have seen gas stations switch to cash only during gas shortages as well to help limit how much fuel people were buying   $ 250 should get you through fine unless you drive a tank and need steak every night you could probably go with less but it 's entirely dependent on your needs as joe rightly stated in his answer if it 's desperate enough times that you ca n't use a cc or debit card cash may not even be useful to you

no one can claim markets are perfectly efficient the stiglitz paradox explains one reason why it is impossible for the market to be perfectly and there are plenty of investors that show it is practically possible to consistently beat the market e.g. the of graham and or 's medallion fund   however even if you accept as true that prices behave strangely around round numbers that is n't a of the efficient market hypothesis the efficient market hypothesis says that price reflect all available information so the expected price tomorrow is just the price today not taking into account the time value of money   the efficient market hypothesis says nothing about how prices are distributed historically a random walk has been used but that is neither a consequence of the emh nor a required assumption   you could say that prices are more volatile the nearer they are to a round number or new high but that does n't necessarily give you an edge in making money off the stock

first it sounds like you are already making wise choices with your cash surplus you 've looked for ways to keep that growing ahead of inflation and you have made use of tax shelters so for the rest of this answer i am going to assume you have between 3 6 months expenses already saved up as a rainy day fund and you 're ready for more sophisticated approaches to growing your funds to answer this part are there any other ways that i can invest that i am not currently doing yes you could look at for example 1 peer to peer these services let you lend to a basket of borrowers and receive a return on your money that is typically higher than what 's offered in cash savings accounts examples of peer to peer networks are zopa and this involves taking some risks with your money zopa 's lending section explains the risks 2 structured deposits these are a type of cash deposit product where in return for locking your money away for a time typically 5 years you get the opportunity for higher returns e.g. 5 + year your deposit is usually guaranteed under the fscs financial services compensation scheme however the returns are dependent on the performance of a stock market index such as the ftse 100 being higher in x years from now also structured deposits usually require a minimum £ 3,000 investment 3 index funds you mention watching the stock prices of a few companies i agree with your conclusion i would n't suggest trying to choose individual stocks at this stage price history is a poor predictor of future performance and markets can be volatile to decide if a stock is worth buying you need to understand the fundamentals be able to assess the current stock price and future outlook and be comfortable accepting a range of different risks including currency and geographic risk if you buy shares in a small number of companies you are concentrating your risk especially if they have things in common with each other index funds while they do carry risks let you pool your money with other investors to buy shares in a basket of stocks to replicate the movement of an index such as the ftse all share the basket of stocks approach at least gives you some built in diversification against the risks of individual stocks i suggest index funds as opposed to actively managed funds where you pay a management fee to have your investments chosen by a professional who tries to beat the market because they are low cost and easier to understand an example of a very low cost index fund is this ftse all share tracker from on the hargreaves lansdown platform general principle on investing in stock market based index funds you should always invest with a 5 + year time horizon this is because prices can move up and down for reasons beyond your anticipation or control volatility time can smooth out volatility generally the longer the time period the greater your likelihood of achieving a positive return i hope this answer so far helps takes into account the excess funds so to answer the second part of your question   or would it be best to start using any excess funds to pay off my student loan quicker your student loan is currently costing you 0.9 interest per annum at this rate it 's lower than the last 10 years average inflation one argument if you repay your student loan this is effectively a 0.9 guaranteed return on every pound repaid this is the equivalent of on a cash savings account if you 're paying basic rate tax on the interest an opposing argument 0.9 is lower than the last 10 years average inflation in the uk there are so many advantages to making a start with growing your money for the long term due to the effects of compound returns that you might choose to defer your loan repayments for a while and focus on building up some investments that stand a chance to beat inflation in the long term

chris   companies like keane ours and others know where to look for these funds and where to ask at the correct agencies that are holding this money that is not part of the public links that you have access to this is how we find this information   our types of companies spend significant time money and resources in finding out about the money then finding who it actually belongs to because it does not always belong to who is mentioned on the list and then finding the correct individual   i apologize if you think this is a marketing ploy   it is not   our company does n't even take phone calls from people that want us to find them money   only if we contact someone because at that time we 're confident that the person we touch base with is due the funds again i am not plugging our company but trying to let neil know that in some cases he is right you do n't need a third party to claim funds for you if you can find them   in this case he has looked and can not find them   keane is charging a fair amount to retrieve funds he can not find and does n't know about and is not charging him anything to do all the work again as mentioned above the direct answer is that we know how to access information and lists that have this money hidden from the public because the agency holding the funds does n't want you to know about it so that they can the funds   is the state 's legal way to confiscate your money    see if you do n't put in a claim for the money depending on what type it is and where it is located the agency and state holding the funds has certain time frames for you to get the money   if you do n't again they get to keep it and that is what they want despite what they say   that is why there is approximately $ 33 billion that is known to the public and really $ 1 trillion that 's out there i apologize if you think that this is a plug for my company it 's not because we 're not looking for calls we make them   i 'm also not asking neil for his business from all accounts on my side this seems like a fair deal

here is a quick and dirty explanation of options in a nutshell you pay a certain amount to buy a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price at some date in the future they come in a few flavors   i 'll give you $ 100 if you let me buy 10,000 shares of xyz for $ 10 more    per share than it is trading at today any time before    august 10th i 'll give you $ 100 if you promise to buy 10,000 shares of xyz from me    for $ 10 less per share than it is trading at today if i ask before august 10th there are also two main types based on the expiration behavior   there are lots of strategies that employ options too many to go into   two key uses are leverage buying call options can give you a much higher return on your investment than just investing in the actual stock however with much higher risk of losing all of your investment instead of just some of it when the stock drops hedging if you already own the underlying stock put options can be used to buy down risk of serious drops in a holding

moving average is mere average line based on historical period broadly use to view the trend but it has no relation to price action in due future course if price is going below 20 sma then in near future even the sma will start directing toward south in your case if price has fallen below all the short period average lines and long period average line then it is bearish in nature soon in few days you may find 20 sma leading downwards followed by closest period and then long also sma and ema can best be observed in charting software in candlestick mode because these moving averages can also be adjusted and viewed based on opening price high prices low price or closing price in you case i guess the data is of closing price data overlapping of averages may be sign of reversals so if you want to buy this stock you may have to wait till all the average lines cross over and when new trend begins with sma of shortest avg period 20 leading above the long avg period 90 days in your case then you can buy and just follow the trend i hope it answers you question

the penny pilot program has a dramatic effect on increasing options liquidity bids can be posted at .01 penny increments instead of .05 increments a lot of money is lost dealing with .05 increments issues are added to the penny pilot program based on existing liquidity in both the stock and the options market but the utility of the penny pilot program outweighs the discretionary liquidity judgement that the cboe makes to list issues in that program the reason the cboe does n't list all stocks in the penny pilot program is because they believe that their data vendors can not handle all of the market data but they have been saying this since 2006 and storage and bandwidth technology has greatly improved since then

a cd is guaranteed to pay its return on maturation   so if you need a certain amount of money at a specific time in the future the cd is a more reliable way of getting it   the stock market might give you more money or less   more is obviously ok   less is not if you 're planning to pay basic expenses with it e.g. food rent etc    most retirement portfolios will have a mix of investments   some securities stocks and bonds some guaranteed returns cds treasuries and some cash equivalents money market savings and checking accounts   cash equivalents are good for short term expenses and an emergency fund   guaranteed returns are good for medium term expenses   securities are good for the long term    once retired the general system is to maintain enough cash equivalents for the next few months of expenses and emergencies   then schedule cds for the next few years so that you have a predictable amount   finally keep the bulk of your wealth in securities   as you get older your potential emergencies increase and your need for savings decreases so the mix shifts more and more to the cash equivalents and guaranteed returns and away from securities    cds have limited use prior to retirement and the couple years right before retirement mainly saving up for a large purchase like a house car or major appliance   even there if you have the option of delaying the purchase that might allow you to use securities instead   perhaps some of your emergency fund in a short term cd that you keep rolling over    note that the problem is n't so much that securities will fall   it 's that they 'll fall right when you need the money   so rather than sell 1 of your securities to meet your needs you have to sell 2   that 's a dead weight loss of 1 that you have to deduct from your returns   that roughly matches the drop from the height of 2007 to the trough of 2009 of the s&p 500   and it was 2012 before it recovered   if in 2007 you had put the 1 of your portfolio in a two year cd you 'd be ahead even at zero interest in 2009

basically your cc is if normal compounded monthly based on a yearly apr to calculate the amount of interest you 'd pay on each of these accounts in a year pull up a spreadsheet like office excel put in your current balance then multiply it by the annual interest rate divided by 12 and add that quantity to the balance subtract any payment you make and the result is your new balance you can project this out for several months to get a good estimate of what you 'll pay in accounting or finance terms what you 're creating is an amortization table so with a $ 10,000 balance at interest and making payments of $ 200/mo the amortization table for one year 's payments might look like as you can see $ 200 is n't paying down this card very quickly in one year you will have paid $ 2,400 of which $ went straight into the bank 's pockets in interest charges reducing your balance by only $ up the payments to $ 300/mo and in 1 year you will have paid $ 3,600 and only been charged $ in interest so you 'll have reduced your balance by $ to only $ which further reduces interest charges down the line you can track the differences in the excel sheet and play what ifs very easily to see the ramifications of spending your $ 5,000 in various ways understand that although for instance may be your base interest rate if the account has become delinquent or you made any cash advances or balance transfers higher or lower interest rates may be charged on a portion of the balance or the entire balance depending on what 's going on with your account a balance transfer may get 0 interest for a year then 19.99 interest after that if not paid off cash advances are always charged at high rates up to 40 apr   most credit card bills will include what may be called an effective apr which is a weighted average apr of all the various sub balances of your account and the interest rates they currently have understand that your payment first pays off interest accrued during the past cycle then pays down the principal on the highest interest portion of the balance first so if you have made a balance transfer to another card and are using that card for purchases the only way to avoid interest on the transfer at the post incentive rates is to pay off the entire balance in a year the minimum payment on a credit card used to be just the amount of accrued interest or sometimes even less if you paid only the minimum payment the balance would never decrease and may increase in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis most banks now enforce a higher minimum payment such that you would pay off the balance in between 3 and 5 years by making only minimum payments this is n't strictly required afaik but because banks are required by the card act to disclose the payoff period at the minimum payment which would be never under most previous policies the higher minimum payments give cardholders hope that as long as they make the minimum payments and do n't charge any more to the card they will get back to zero

first piece of advice fire your agent    a pushy agent is a bad agent   from what you 've told us he 's actually given you poor advice regarding mortgage interest rates   rates are already at historic lows   that and the state of the world economy mean that further rate cuts are more likely in the near term second piece of advice while more information on the real estate market you 're in would help   going in at asking price is rarely a good idea    sale prices from the last few years are not relevant to what you should pay because the last few years include a financial crisis caused in large part by the bursting of a housing bubble   they could be even less relevant depending on your location because of a spike in foreclosures in certain areas of the u.s.   there was already a ton of housing inventory before so an increase due to foreclosures is going to depress prices further   now that banks are finally practicing the due diligence they should have been all along your ability to be pre approved for large mortgage amount puts you in a strong position    use a tool like zillow or to see what properties in that area have sold for over the past six months   you should also be able to see a history of what prices the particular property you 're interested in has been offered and/or sold at in the past   also check and see how long the particular property you 're interested in has been on the market   if it 's been on the market more than 60 90 days it 's priced too high

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

chip and signature cards do not substantially alter the paradigm you mention in your question the chip alters how the machine obtains your account number and it for authentication but it does not significantly alter the interaction with the clerk   it is solely intended to reduce skimming and similar card number stealing and card forging attacks specifically a clerk is still welcome to ask to see the card to verify the signature if they wish and/or to ask to see an id to use the card   some changes occurred around the same time as introducing chip and signature that meant that clerks will be less likely to ask for signatures for certain purchases raising the dollar amount for no signature required purchases mostly but those changes are distinct from the introduction of emv chip authentication

options both puts and calls are typically written sold at different strike prices for example even though the stock of xyz is currently trading at $ 12.50 there could be put options for prices ranging from $ 0.50 to $ just as an example there are several factors that go into determining the strike prices at which people are willing to write options the writer seller of an option is the person on the other side of the trade that has the opposite opinion of you if you are interested in purchasing a put on a stock to hedge your downside that means the writer seller of the put is betting that you are wrong and that the stock price will rise instead

does it make sense to calculate the irr based on the outstanding value of the project or just use the cash flows paid out let 's assume i invest x amount every year for 49 years and the investment grows at a constant rate but i do not get dividends before which will be constant 50 years later i assume that the value of the investment will decline as it pays dividend and will be worth 0 when the dividends stop    do i calculate the irr as the negative streams of outflows for the first 49 years and then positive cash inflows from 50 year in the future if i apply this method the irr will be very low almost equal to the annual expected return   or based on the current value of the project for each year combined with cash outflows for the first 49 years and dividends from year 50 if i apply this method the irr will be a lot higher than the first method

while there is no age limit bear in mind that saving money makes sense only if it does n't delay your paying off expensive debt if you have credit cards or expensive loans you would be best placed to focus on paying them down before saving a lot if you save and keep debt you 'll effectively lose money as the interest on your debt will usually be higher than you can earn on savings having said that it 's worth saving a small amount anyway to have as an emergency fund as you pay off your debt start saving the money you no longer have to pay out and it will soon pay dividends

the first step i would do is determine the asset class mixture for your current portfolio and the mixture for your new one if they are the same and all you are doing is changing the funds that you use to invest in that mixture of asset class then just do the change all at once in this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes   if you are also changing your asset class mixture then it depends on how large the change is i would still do the whole change at once but if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps i would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix

gt i think a the thing with depression and recession is just what he uses to define those economic statuses he says at the that his thinking on the subject is what he uses and might not be conventional    i see   but if the severity of economic recessions depressions can be categorized by say what of debt defaults or is restructured in a certain period of time that actually would be a convenient way to think about different recession events intuitively instead of just the degree to which gdp goes up or down   and i wonder if defaults debt restructurings are a leading or lagging indicator of a recession   gt   for the different methods of depression recovery i beleive he was trying to say that the path to a beautiful requires balance the deflationary tactics have there own merits and are not solely for the purpose of offsetting the inflationary methods but a balance of everything is the most crucial factor for an efficient recovery   austerity is deflationary and i 'm not sure there are any mainstream academic economists who support austerity during a recession but again i have serious doubts whether debt reduction and wealth distribution can be called deflationary   especially wealth distribution which is basically the same thing as fiscal spending which is included in the print money inflationary category in the video combined with regressive taxes     i would think that monetary easing and fiscal stimulus both inflationary help employment recover and once employment recovers enough inflation can rise   once inflation is expected to rise too much then you can crank up interest rates lower fiscal spending   i do n't think you really need to worry about adding in deflation for a balance when trying to recover an economy   hyperinflation happens only in extreme cases and stagflation as far as i know is a technical case that is hard to explain in a video like this   certainly austerity is unlikely to help stagflation

some of the other answers mention this but i want to highlight it with a personal anecdote i have a property in a mid sized college town in the us its current worth about what we paid for it 9 years ago but i do n't care at all because i will likely never sell it that house is worth about $ 110,000 but rents for $ 1500 per month it is a good investment if you take rental income and the increase in equity from paying down the mortgage subtracting maintenance the return on the down payment is very good i have n't mentioned the paper losses involved in depreciation as that 's fairly us specific the laws are different in other jurisdictions but for at least the first two years we showed losses while making money so there are tax advantages as well at least currently those laws also change over time there is a large difference between investing in a property for appreciation and investing for income even in those categories there are niches that can vary widely commercial vs residential trendy vacation tourist areas etc each has their place but ensure that you do n't confuse a truism meant for one type of real estate investing as being applicable to real estate investing in general

and where does that spending by the government usually end up right back into the economy putting that tax money into the hands of the wealthy means they will do what they do best hoard it if you have an economy that 's built on a certain amount of spending by the government then cut that off because you decrease the government 's cash flow then you have to have an equal response in terms of spending kansas showed that most wealthy people do not spend the money they get to keep from lower taxes that in turn causes a strain on the economy and you end up with both fiscal woes at the state level and economic woes for businesses and individuals that 's what happened in kansas and that 's what will happen at the federal level if these tax cuts are enacted this is fine for the wealthy they win in this scenario but they are the only ones who do instead the tax cuts should be focused on the lower and middle classes who will actually go out and spend that money but as written these tax cuts disproportionately favor the wealthy who will not spend to help individuals and small businesses

you are correct that it is relatively easy for someone to create fake checks and steal money   they even made a movie about it and not much has changed since that movie takes place   however most checking accounts do indeed have $ 0 liability for this type of check fraud referred to as check forgery if someone does cash a check against your account that you did not write you will eventually get your money back   essentially the thief stole from the bank or the merchant that accepted the check not from you in the u.s. check forgery is generally covered by state law   according to a q&a on the cfpb website if you report to the bank that a check that cleared your account was forged in some way and you do this within a reporting window defined by state law the bank is supposed to return your money

if you have significant assets such as a large deposit then diversification of risks such as currency risk is good practice there are many good options but keeping 100 of it in is definitely not a good idea nor is keeping 100 of it in a single foreign currency   of course it would be much more beneficial to have done it yesterday and moments of extreme volatility generally are a bad time to make large uninformed trades but if the deposit is sufficiently large say equal to annual expenses then it would make sense to split it among different currencies and also different types of assets as well deposit stocks precious metals bonds the rate of rouble may go up and down but you also have to keep in mind that future events such as fluctuating oil price may risk a much deeper crisis than now and you can look to experiences of the 1998 crisis as an example of what may happen if the situation continues to deteriorate

from the 1st quarter 10q match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to in exchange for cash the issue debt supported by collections on the transferred advances we made these transfers under the terms of our advance facility agreements these transfers do not qualify for sale accounting because we retain control over the transferred assets as a result we account for these transfers as and classify the transferred advances on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as match funded advances and the related liabilities as match funded liabilities we use collections on the match funded advances pledged to the to repay principal and to pay interest and the expenses of the entity holders of the debt issued by this entity can look only to the assets of the entity itself for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against    i 'm not an expert in the accounting of these things but i 'll take a stab from the view of a bond investor   let 's assume the in question have been pooled together and sold into the bond market in the form of a mortgage backed security mbs     when a homeowner falls behind on their payment scheduled principal and interest their monthly mortgage payment amount or is advanced as if the borrower is still current to the person who holds the mbs   this is typically done from the time they first fall behind until either they 1 catch up on their payments or 2 are foreclosed upon and the home is sold to repay the mortgage balance   in either instance the advanced monthly payments are recaptured by the servicer before the holder of the mbs is paid   in this sense the servicer develops a sort of prepaid asset over time by advancing money they are almost certain to recover at a future date usually via foreclosure and liquidation     due to a high number of borrowers falling behind on their payments since the housing crisis and the resulting time it takes to foreclose on a property the etc have built a large balance of advances on the asset side of their balance sheet   to free up this cash prior to liquidation of the home they have sold short term bonds against this asset via an thereby creating the liability you reference   so in essence they have say a home they expect to be liquidated in twelve months that they have advanced on   the short term bonds sold via the offset this asset at an equivalent term thereby making the asset and liability match funded

if there were no contribution limits you could shelter practically all of your income from income tax the government would not have sufficient tax revenue hence there are limits which ensure some personal income remains taxable today similarly when you retire there are rules for minimum required distributions withdrawals which ensure the government gets to tax some of your income each year in your retirement depending on the account type one other advantage of limits is to encourage people to approach saving for retirement using regular ongoing contributions made in the context of each year 's limit the limit in a sense can be a form of guidance some aim to contribute to the limit and some even save beyond it using plain taxable investments

is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7 9 with the money borrowed at 3 4 from one of these brokerages yes and no it depends on your risk profile any investment has its risks of losing your capital but not investing is a guaranteed risk as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation regarding investing on margin this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses regarding the stock market when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential remember in regards to investing on margin if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting it is no use gaining 9 in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15 or more in capital each year also what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future these are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest no investment is totally safe or risk free but it is less risky than not investing at all as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan

yes i know this is a seven year old question does this only apply to debts that were taken on during marriage   yes or to all debts of both partners no the important thing to remember is that it 's both debts and assets acquired during the marriage which are shared this comes from the reality that men in the olden times were the ones in business accumulating wealth etc while the woman made the home   the working assumption was that the woman who made the home was an equal partner with the man since he benefited from a good home and she benefited from his income the fact that pre marriage debts and assets were not community property also protected the woman because she was able to then take back her and use that to support herself i live in a cp state

the 20x number is drawn directly from the assumption that it should be easy to get more than 4 average return on investment after lots of historical studies   monte carlo simulations and the like there was a consensus that saving more did n't significantly increase the odds of achieving at least the desired yearly income sustainably that 's the same calculations the insurance firms use as the starting point for writing annuities there are also some assumptions about inflation and its interaction with the market built into this rule of thumb note that this is 20x what you want as post retirement income not necessarily 20x your current income i have a moderately frugal lifestyle and my budget confirms that my actual spending even in years when i allow myself a splurge is well below my current income with the excess going into the investments to sustain my lifestyle i need that lower number plus any taxes that 'll be due on it plus whatever i want to allocate as average emergency reserve and theoretically i should be able to base the 20x on that lower number when i run estimates quicken has a tool for this so does my credit union i   presume others are widely available they tend to confirm this i 'm still using the higher number for planning though i do n't feel any need to retire early though i have issues with my current manager and i have no objection at all to being able to afford better toys on occasion or to leaving a legacy to friends relatives and/or charity but it 's nice to know exactly when i could the day job if i wanted to

krugman argues and i agree with him on this one that this is a sign that the us is in a liquidity wiki basically interest rates are near 0 and the banks are very risk adverse right now so they sit on reserves instead of lending them out in this scenario the government printing money has no effect on inflation or much of anything because it just sits in bank reserves   a more right wing economist might spin a different story though

i 'll address one part of your question there are other taxes that companies pay as well such as income tax but do n't charge to the customer as a fee so why are gross receipts taxes charged to the customer things like income tax ca n't be passed on to the consumer in a direct way because there 's no fixed relationship between the amount of the tax and the price of an individual product   income tax is paid on taxable income which will incorporate deductions for the costs the company incurred to do business   so the final amount of corporate income tax can depend on things unrelated to the price of goods sold like whether the business decided to their parking lot gross receipts taxes by definition are charged on the total amount of money taken in so every dollar you spend on an item at the store will be subject to the gross receipts tax and hence will cost the business 7 cents or x% where x is the tax rate   this means there is a direct link between the price you pay for an individual item and the tax they pay on that transaction   the same is true for sales taxes which are also often added at the time of sale of course businesses could roll all of these into the posted price as well   the reason they do n't is to get their foot in the door and make the price seem lower you 're more likely to buy something if you see it for the low low one time only price of $ 99.99 act now save big and then find out you owe an extra $ 7 at the register than if you saw $ 107 on the price tag

two kinds of lending going on the first occurs when the federal reserve purchases government securities   this creates reserves at the federal reserve in another bank the second kind of lending comes when this bank lends out the money   this is the multiplier effect the reason for the excess reserves now is that banks are gun shy and afraid to lend   their money is safer at the fed than with commercial and personal borrowers   when this changes either by a recovery or by the fed penalizing banks for excess reserves which it can do but has n't then we 'll see inflation and a consequential rise in prices

i actually love this question and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself there some obvious touch points most people do n't have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a $ 5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios there are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your as you get near retirement age index funds are not touted as categorically the best investment they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest there is still a management component to an index like the s&p500   the index does n't simply buy a share of apple and watch it over time   the s&p 500 is n't simply a single share of each of the 500 us companies it 's market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes   voo makes a lot of trades every day to track the s&p index passive index investing is almost an oxymoron the most obvious part of this is that if index funds were the best way to invest money berkshire hathaway would be 100 invested in voo   the argument for passive index investing is simplified for public consumption   the reality is that over time large actively managed funds have under performed the large index funds net of fees   in part the of the advice is that the average person is or should be more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings   investment professionals generally want to avoid how come i my money only returned 4 when the market index returned 7   if you track the index you wo n't do worse than the index this helps people sleep better at night in my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend $ 0 making investment decisions and $ 0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold   they simply track an index xyz company is 0.07 of the index then the fund carries 0.07 of xyz even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there the argument for a majority of your funds residing in mutual funds etfs is simple when you 're of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should i sell a share of amazon or a share of exxon   would n't you rather just sell 2 units of index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission   for this simplicity you give up three basis points   it seems pretty reasonable to me

total capital this is a very old fashioned term that really is mostly only used in the finance industry today like when everyone was obsessed with bank capital total capital = preferred equity + common equity + liabilities true blue preferred shares are almost only used by financial companies banks specifically   the more modern ones that convert to common are used by all other companies notes payable this is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in generally accepted account principles gaap the oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date    this has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal interest    a bank note like a one dollar bill is a note that pays something in this case one dollar never technically the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract   while it pays one dollar it never pays it back so it has a constant value of one dollar   the constant nature inflation notwithstanding is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange gaap has taken its own definition to mean any debt payable within 12 months as it is a current < 12 months liability

everyone is usually better off without insurance   a very few people are much better off with insurance   insurance is a gamble and when you lose you win   very few people lose badly enough to win   most people just pay money into insurance and never get as much back as they pay in   for most people in most lives insurance is a bad deal   the reason people crave insurance is because they can not calculate the probability of something bad happening as well as an actuary can do so   the gap in knowledge between you and and actuary is what make insurance providers rich and you poor   they are smart you are not   you think some terrible thing is going to happen to you they know it probably wo n't   so they sell you a product you probably will never need   anyhow most people ca n't understand probability and how to analyze risk so they wo n't get what i 'm saying here understanding the real cost of risk is the first lesson in understanding money and wealth   rich people usually understand the value and cost of risk   hence they only buy insurance when they expect to lose that is to win   we rich people do everything only when we know already we are going to win   we do n't gamble unless we are the house   when a self made rich man buys something its because he knows already he is going to come out ahead on it most probably

to a certain extent small cap companies will in general follow the same trends as large cap companies the extent of this depends on numerous factors but a prime reason is the presence of systemic risk i.e. the risk to the entire market in simple terms is the risk that your portfolio will approach as you increase its diversification and it 's why hedging is also important   that being said small cap businesses will in general likely do worse than large cap stocks for several reasons this was is certainly the case in the great recession   small cap businesses have on average higher betas which is a measure of a company 's risk compared to the overall market this means that small cap companies on average outperform large cap companies during boom times but it also means that they suffer more on average during bear times the debate over whether or not the standard beta is still useful for small cap companies continues however some economists feel that small cap companies are better measured against the russell 2000 or similar indexes instead of the s&p 500   small cap companies may face problems accessing or maintaining access to lines of credit during the great recession major lenders decreased their lending to small businesses which might make it harder for them to weather the storm   on a related point small businesses might not have as large an asset base to use as collateral for loans in bad times one notable large cap company that used its asset base to their advantage was ford which gave banks partial ownership of its factories during hard times this a gave ford a good amount of cash with which to continue their short term operations and b gave the banks a vested interest in keeping ford 's lines of credit open ford struggled but it never faced the financial problems of gm and chrysler   despite political rhetoric about main street vs. wall street small businesses do n't receive as much government aid in times of crisis as some large cap companies do for example the small business lending fund a brilliant but poorly implemented idea in 2010 allocated less than $ 30 billion to small businesses the actual amount loaned was considerably less compare that to the amounts loaned out under tarp discussions about corporate lobbying power aside small businesses are n't as crucial to the overall stability of the financial system small businesses do n't always have the manpower to keep up with changes in regulation when the dodd frank act passed large banks as an example could hire more staff to understand it and adapt to it relatively easily small banks however do n't always have the resources to invest in such efforts   there are other reasons some of which are industry specific but these are some of the basic ones   if you want visual confirmation that small cap businesses follow a similar trend here is a graph of the russell 2000 and s&p 500 indexes   here is a similar graph for the russell 2000 and the dow jones industrial average    if you wanted to confirm this technically and control for the numerous complicated factors overlap between indexes systemic risk seasonal adjustment etc just ask and i 'll try to run some numbers on it when i have a chance keep in mind too that looking at a pretty picture is no substitute for rigorous financial econometrics a basic start would be to look at the correlation between the indexes which i calculate as and respectively as you can see they 're pretty close once again however the reality is more complicated technically and a sufficiently detailed analysis is beyond my capabilities just a quick side note these graphs show the logarithm of the values of the indexes which is a common statistical nuance that is used when comparing time series with radically different magnitudes but similar trends   s&p500 and russell 2000 data came from yahoo finance and the dow jones industrial average data came from federal reserve economic data fred per usual i try to provide code whenever possible if i used it here is the stata code i used to generate the graphs above this code assumes the presence of and downloaded from yahoo finance and downloaded from fred in the current directory   fidelity published an article   on the subject that you might find interesting and seeking alpha has several pieces related to small cap vs. large cap returns that might be worth a read too

my perspective is from the us many employers offer 401(k)s and you can always contribute to an ira for either tax deferred or tax free investment growth if you 're company offers a 401(k match you should always contribute the maximum amount they max or you 're leaving money on the table     companies ca n't always support pensions and it is n't the best idea to rely on one entirely for retirement unless your pension is from the federal government    even states such as illinois are going through extreme financial difficulties due to pension funding issues it 's only going to get worse and if you think pension benefit accrual is n't going to be cut eventually you 'll have another thing coming i 'd be worried if i was a state employee in the middle of my career with no retirement savings outside of my pension    ranting employees pushed hard for some pretty absurd commitments and public officials let the public down by giving in it seems a little crazy to me that someone can work for the state until they 're in their 50 's and then earn 70 of their 6 figure salary for the rest of their life something needs to be done but i 'd be surprised if anyone has the political will to make tough choices now before thee options get much much worse and these states are forced to make a decision

get a credit card is not the answer the reason people have a bad or no credit score is often because they 're new to the country have just turned 18 have previously fallen into arrears or are just bad with money getting a credit card is risky because if you do n't stay on top of your payments it 'll just damage your score even more   now it sounds like i hate credit cards but i do n't and they do have their benefits but avoid them if possible because they can be more hassle than they 're worth ie paying the credit back on time cancelling accounts when the interest comes in moving money in and out of accounts it 's risky borrowing money from anywhere whether it 's a payday lender a bank a credit card etc so use them as a last resort if you 've got your own income then that 's amazing try not to live outside of your means and your credit score will look after and increase itself it takes time to build a good credit score but always make sure you pay the people you owe on time and the full amount i 'd stick with paying your phone provider and any other direct debits you have setup and avoid getting a credit card i 'd recommend to keep track of your credit score and read their faq on how to help build it unlike experian it 's free forever so not quite as detailed but are owned by one of the biggest credit reference agencies in the uk so they should have the latest information on yourself in conclusion if you already have financial commitments like a mobile phone bill gym membership store cards anything that gets paid monthly by direct debit your credit score will increase provided you pay the full amount on time    i hope this helps ps i do n't work for any of the companies here but i 've been working in the finance sector more specifically short term loans for 3 + years now

i do n't like buying individual bonds for my own portfolio   i actually used to buy long term government strip bonds or provincial bonds but i stopped   here are some reasons why my broker allows me to purchase bonds via their web application   however to sell a bond i had to call in to the fixed income trading desk   that was inconvenient   but your broker may be different bonds do n't typically trade on a formal exchange   so there 's no cheap easy way as far as i know to get an independent quote for a bond 's value i had to trust what my broker said my bond was worth when assessing my portfolio performance    i asked my broker once how they arrive at the market value shown i.e. whether it was last bid ask or actual trade and i was told they use a third party bond quotation valuation information provider for the data and that quotes are an estimate of what the bond would be worth based on similar bonds   i quickly learned that was n't the value i could actually get when selling it when you 're dealing with your broker to buy and sell bonds you 're likely dealing with theirs or a related investment bank which makes a market for specific issues of bonds   while i was n't being charged an explicit commission to buy or sell bonds it was evident the broker makes money off the spread   that is the difference between what they would be willing to sell a bond for and what they would be willing to buy that same bond for   they will buy your bond back from you cheaper than what they could turn around and sell it to somebody else for   that 's why they do n't charge an explicit commission it 's built in and hidden anyway when i finally discovered my broker would seldom actually offer me the market value quoted for my bonds typically it would be bought back for a few percent less than it were theoretically worth i gave up   i do n't think bonds simply are liquid enough nor the costs transparent enough for retail investors   or maybe it 's just me however i do think bonds remain an important part of a diversified portfolio   bonds ought to be represented in a diversified portfolio using low cost bond index mutual funds or exchange traded funds   since these funds buy sell bonds in large quantities they get a better deal on the spreads   so while you do pay an explicit management fee for a fund you are probably saving since you 're not getting shafted on the spreads

index funds can be a very good way to get into the stock market it 's a lot easier and cheaper to buy a few shares of an index fund than it is to buy a few shares in hundreds of different companies an index fund will also generally charge lower fees than an actively managed mutual fund where the manager tries to pick which stocks to invest for you while the actively managed fund might give you better returns by investing in good companies instead of every company in the index that does n't always work out and the fees can eat away at that advantage stocks on average are expected to yield an annual return of 4 after inflation consider that when you see an expense ratio of 1 index funds should charge you more like or so possibly more if it 's an exotic index the question is what sort of index you 're going to invest in the standard and poor 's 500 s&p 500 is a major index and if you see someone talking about the performance of a mutual fund or investment strategy there 's a good chance they 'll compare it to the return of the s&p 500 moreover there are a variety of index funds and exchange traded funds that offer very good expense ratios e.g. vanguard 's etf charges very cheap you can also find some funds which try to get you exposure to the entire world stock market e.g. vanguard total world stock etf nyse vt an index fund is probably the ideal way to start a portfolio easy and you get a lot of diversification later when you have more money available you can consider adding individual stocks or investing in specific sectors or regions someone else suggested brazil russia indo china or brics having some money invested in that region is n't necessarily a bad idea but putting all or most of your money in that region would be if brics are more of your portfolio then they are of the world economy your portfolio is n't balanced also while these countries are experiencing a lot of economic growth that does n't always mean that the companies that you own stock in are the ones which will benefit small businesses and new ventures may make up a significant part of that growth bond funds are useful when you want to diversify your portfolio so that it 's not all stocks there 's a bunch of portfolio theory built around asset allocation strategies the idea is that you should try to maintain a target mix of assets whatever the market 's doing the basic simplified guideline about investing for retirement says that your portfolio should have your in bonds e.g. a 30-year old should have 30 in bonds a old 50 this helps maintain a balance between the volatility of your portfolio the stock market 's ups and downs and the rate of return you want to earn money when you can but when it 's almost time to spend it you do n't want a sudden stock market crash to wipe it all out bonds help preserve that value but do n't have as nice of a return the other idea behind asset allocation is that if the market changes e.g. your stocks go up a lot while your bonds stagnate you rebalance and buy more bonds if the stock market subsequently crashes you move some of your bond money back into stocks this basically means that you buy low and sell high just by maintaining your asset allocation this is generally more reliable than trying to time the market and move into an asset class before it goes up and move out before it goes down market timing is just speculation you get better returns if you guess right but you get worse returns if you guess wrong commodity funds are useful as another way to diversify your portfolio and can serve as a little bit of protection in case of crisis or inflation you can buy gold silver platinum and palladium etfs on the stock exchanges having a small amount of money in these funds is n't a bad idea but commodities can be subject to violent price swings moreover a bar of gold does n't really earn any money and owning a share of a precious metals etf will incur administrative storage and insurance costs to boot a well run business does earn money assuming you 're saving for the long haul retirement or something several decades off my suggestion for you would be to start by investing most of your money in index funds to match the total world stock market with something like the aforementioned nyse vt for instance a small portion in bonds and a smaller portion in commodity funds for all the negative stuff i 've said about market timing it 's pretty clear that the bond market is very expensive right now and so are the commodities then as you do additional research and determine what sort investments are right for you add new investment money in the places that you think are appropriate stock funds bond funds commodity funds individual stocks sector specific funds actively managed mutual funds et cetera and try to maintain a reasonable asset allocation have fun most of your investment money you should have a separate fund for emergencies and do n't invest money in stocks if you know you 're going need it within the next few years

that s easy   people do n't confess against gangs because its a completely different game instead of two prisoners you have one prisoner and an organization that can go after the prisoners family   competition differs from the prisoners because a lack of communication or the presence of some form of uncertainty as to the other players motives is a necessary its notable as well that cartel behavior almost always fails in the long run due to the first movers advantage in breaking the agreement and stealing the competitors business

does your business have a loan or overdraft with a bank if so that bank will be much more likely to offer you a personal mortgage if you can show them a solid business plan and your profits for each year other than that make sure you have a perfect credit rating use experian to iron out any small things that might get in the way

i do n't really see the big deal in taking the check fidelity will issue you a check made payable to vanguard your name all you have to do is simply hand the check over to vanguard to deposit into your new ira simple and done to answer your question whether or not a custodian tpa or recordkeeper will do a direct deposit or transfer of your funds is completely at their discretion my company rarely does direct transfers we issue a check to you it 's just the way we do it you can talk to vanguard and see if they can initiate the direct transfer with fidelity but honestly this may just delay getting your funds moved and you 're going to end up with a check anyways and if vanguard does somehow convince fidelity to do the wire transfer there is still going to be a fee wires are expensive unless vanguard is willing to pick up the wire fee for you doubtful other 's have also mentioned that tpa 's will withhold a mandatory 20 federal tax withholding if they send you a check this is only true if the check gets made payable in your name but the taxes should not be withheld as long as the check is made payable to your new vanguard ira so my final opinion just take the check and give it to your vanguard rep it 's literally that simple

the worst thing about wholesale deals uk is that they wo n’t get back to you in time and their excuses are ridiculous the suppliers listed there are equally arrogant i hate how some use internet to trap people i am rather stunned to see how low someone can get to make money business dealings work on fair rules and if the bridging body is so what good further contacts can do to you

insurance is a financial product to control risk the fact that a loss would not be catastrophic simply makes the decision to carry insurance less critical it is perfectly reasonable to be self insured in this case this is assuming we are discussing replacement of your property vs liability which you have made clear like many other products one buys a fine reason to purchase insurance is simply because one wants to just because you can absorb the loss does not mean that you want to take on the full risk i would be careful of your analysis here insurance companies on average make money by selling insurance which means you lose money on average by dealing with them insurance companies make money based on the cumulative probability that they will have to pay on multiple policies to make money they analyze the risk that in a given period they will only pay on a portion of their hundreds of thousands or millions of policies this is a different analysis than the probability that you will have a loss on your specific asset   your risk of a loss is not equivalent to their risk of loss here the argument that they only win if you individually lose is not a good one

a lot of investors prefer to start jumping into tools and figuring out from there but i 've always said that you should learn the theory before you go around applying it so you can understand its shortcomings   a great starting point is investopedia 's introduction to technical analysis there you can read about the idea of technical analysis how it compares to other strategies what some of the big ideas are and quite a bit about various chart patterns cup and handle flags head shoulders etc you 'll also cover ideas like moving averages and after that charting and technical analysis by fred should be your next stop the material in the book overlaps with what you 've read on investopedia but 's book is great for learning from examples and seeing the concepts applied in action the book is for new and does a good job explaining how to utilize all these charts and patterns and after finishing it you should be ready to invest on your own   if you make it this far feel free to jump into fidelity 's tools now and start applying what you 've learned you always want to make the connection between theory and practice so start   figuring out how you can use your new knowledge to generate good returns   eventually you should read the excellent reference text technical analysis of the financial markets by john murphy this book is like a murphy covers almost all the major techniques of technical analysts and helps you intuitively understand the reasoning behind them i 'd like to quote a part of a review here to show my point   what i    like about mr. murphy is his way of showing and proving a point let    me digress here to show you what i mean say you had a daughter and    wanted to show her how to figure out the area of an    well you could tell her to memorize that it is    or if you really wanted her to learn it thoroughly you    can show her how to draw a parallel line to the height then join the    ends to make a nice rectangle then to compute the area of a rectangle    just multiply the two sides one being the height the other being    half the base she will then derive this and    understand how they got the formula you see then she can    compute the area under a or a or any complex    object well mr. murphy will show us the same way and    derive for us concepts such as how a resistance line later    becomes a support line the for this is so amusing that after    one reads about it we just go wow now i understand why    this occurs murphy 's book is not about strategy or which tools to use he takes an objective approach to describing the basics about various tools and techniques and leaves it up to the reader to decide which tools to apply and when that 's why it 's pages and a great reference whenever you 're working   if you make it through and understand murphy then you 'll be golden again understand the theory first but make sure to see how it 's applied as well otherwise you 're just reading without any practical knowledge to quote richard feynman it does n't matter how beautiful your theory is it does n't matter how smart you are if it does n't agree with experiment it 's wrong   personally i think technical analysis is all bs and a waste of time and most of the top investors would agree but at the end of the day ignore everyone and stick to what works for you best of luck

as a rule of thumb no   only in very rare circumstances will it prove better than a rrsp   the media has overplayed the usefulness of this account type for retirement savings   that 's just a general rule   your specific situation will make a difference but it 's very easy to show that rrsps will always outperform if the marginal rates are lower on withdrawal than when you deduct contributions from income if you plan to use the money before retirement or you 're expecting to collect on retirement then you may need to look at the specifics of your situation   if you plan to put money in a rrsp and carry forward the deduction to use at a later date then it does n't matter whether you put it in a rrsp now or use the tfsa and transfer it later the rrsp also has advantages of some tax treaties and creditor protection   it as a can also be used after 65 for income splitting and the pension credit an resp can also provide a greater return as you get free money which is always good   there are many other things you can do with it but i 'd say it 's always better in a tfsa than paying tax in a regular account    since you pay the mortgage with after tax dollars that could be another option for the cash and it 's a guaranteed return albeit small nowadays

i contend that there is great value in over paying during the year and reaping a bigger refund   i 'm an engineer and understand the concept interest earned blah blah but for most of us this is n't reality the reality is that we spend what we earn plus a little more   at the end of each month if the typical american has money left over we spend it we do n't faithfully put that money that we would have payed into taxes to good use such as savings or paying off that credit card   getting that big refund at the end of the year tends encourage us to make that one time large payment to that high interest account or to purchase that item that we otherwise would n't have saved for or purchased with a credit card   i say give uncle sam the free interest you 'll have wasted that money during the year anyway and enjoy a nice healthy refund that you can put to use for something you enjoy   life is just too short   edit for the nose that ca n't think beyond the possibility of a different perspective post

there are many people who have deductions far above the standard deduction but still do n't itemize that 's their option even though it comes at a cost it may be foolish but it 's not illegal   if @littleadv citation is correct the under penalty of perjury type issue what of those filers who file a schedule a but purposely leave off their donations i 've seen many people discuss charity and write that they do not want to benefit in any way from their donation yet still schedule a their mortgage and property tax their returns are therefore fraudulent   i am curious to find a situation in which the taxpayer benefits from such a oversight or better still a cited case where they were charged with doing so i 've offered advice on filings return that was n't truthful when you own a stock and can not find cost basis there are times that you might realize the basis is so low that just entering zero will cost you less than $ 100 in extra tax you are not truthful of course but this kind of false statement is n't going to lead to any issue if it gets noticed within an audit no agent is going to give it more than a moment of time and perhaps suggest you did n't even know the year it was bought but there would be no consequence   my answer is for personal returns i 'm sure for business accuracy to the dollar is actually important

they could if they wanted it 's of course illegal to do if you did n't authorize it and to process credit cards they need to have a relationship with a credit card processing company which is not so easy to fake not any joe could do that using a fake id note that you are protected through your credit card company if you tell them it 's an unauthorized charge they 'll return it to you without discussion it is then the vendor 's duty to prove that it was authorized and if he can not he 'll pay extra fees to the processing company overall the risk is very small it should n't be your worry

all excellent answers   scott w. already mentioned to look out for sales and many other answers are ways to be smart with portions   do n't or be smart with bulk buys but i 'm surprised nobody mentioned one of the things i 'd consider obvious about saving money on groceries   coupons coupons can save cash   we 'll sometimes use coupons for brands we 'd be buying anyway or other comparably priced brands that we 're willing to try   the thing to be careful of with coupons is when the manufacturer is attempting to up sell you to a premium brand or trying to get you to buy a product you 'd never have bought anyway anyway we especially like the coupons that costco sends in the mail once in a while or those they hand out at the warehouse entrance   what better way to save than to all the better if the items are n't perishable   when we have the space and those grocery savings stars are all in alignment we load up on such items as paper towels cereal bars soap etc

not only should you do this you should tell your friends to do it too especially if a parent comes in to the bank with the child banks fall over themselves to provide a card to someone whose only income is allowance really later if you 're 21 and your car broke and you do n't get paid for another 11 days nobody will lend you the money or those money mart places that charge 300 a year will to fix it never mind score and yes for sure having a good score will be a result and a good one just having the card for emergencies makes all the difference to your early twenties my kids have several friends who now ca n't get credit cards some are students some are underemployed and end up missing paid days of work due to car troubles they ca n't pay to fix or using those payday lenders or other things that keep you poor get one while you can using it sensibly means you will have a great credit score in a decade or so but just plain having it is worth more than you can know if you 're not 18 yet

can you afford to lose the $ 2200 if not the answer is do n't buy the stock no one can tell you if a stock will continue to go up but the general rule is that the more hype there is on a stock the more likely it is that it 's reached a top and is due for a downward correction soon also note that the more expectation there is for a company the more negatively the market will react if the company 's earnings report comes in even slightly below expectation or if the company hints at a slowdown in the future if that buyback does n't happen you mentioned expect the stock to drop a lot only a really positive surprise news announcement will make it continue to rise on earnings day if you really want to buy this stock my advice would be to learn about chart patterns and other basic technical analysis to have at least some idea of whether the stock is due for a correction soon if you see it grow in a hockey stick shape upward it probably is

credit scores rates are based on sometimes simple and sometimes quite complex statistical models linear models neural networks regression and classification trees mixture models depends on whether it is something more general like fico or what large banks develop in house in any case there are many legislation dependent factors qualitative such as education occupation security sex etc payment history or quantitative such as age liquidity and leverage ratios etc   now most model that are used today are and closely held trade secrets the most important reason for this is actually because of the databases that feed the models more better quality data is what makes the real difference although at the cutting edge the mathematicians statisticians computer scientists that design the algorithms will make a huge difference   now back to the main thing the credit score rate is meant to be used only as an indicator for representing the probability of default how likely you are to default on your obligation towards me is what it means and that is largely based upon has company he she honoured his financial obligations of a certain consumer in more sophisticated models they may also use your industry sector or occupational and financial security to predict the future behaviour however this credit score has meaning only in relation to a credit limit can you pay back my $ x the credit limit on the other hand is defined by your income level debt asset etc    as a credit risk analyst whether we are dealing with large corporate loans mortgages personal loans etc the principles are the same one thing to consider is that factors considered in determining a credit score usually do not have a simple linear relationship   consumer profile types such as rate are a lot more about effect than cause    the most important thing is to honour your obligations whether you pay before or after you spend makes little difference so long as you pay in full and prior to maturity your rate score will improve with time financial institutions have many ways to make money of everyone some such as interest rates and fees are directly charged to you and some are charged to your goods and services providers that has no bearing on your score sometimes it even makes sense to take on customers with rock bottom ratings lend them lots of money and charge them to dirt as you may well know the recent financial crisis with ongoing after shocks and was the result of such practices

i have had it two way now i got pre approval from my credit union which just so happened to be one of the bigger vehicle lenders in the metro area   what i found out was that the dealership which was one of the bigger ones in the metro area had a computer system that looked up my deal with the credit union basically i signed some contracts and the cu and the dealership did whatever paperwork they needed to without me i bought a used car and drove it off of the lot that night and i did n't ever go back for anything financial both my wife and her sister received blank checks that were valid up to a certain amount   in the case of my sister in law she signed the check the dealership called to confirm funds and she drove off in the case of my wife she ended up negotiating a better deal with dealer finance but i was assured she only had to sign the check get it verified and drive the car home

in the uk there is a significant difference between taking money out of a bank account and out of a credit card account banks typically require explicit authorisation before they will transfer money out of a bank account for example a direct debit agreement north american banks are much less strict and will transfer your money to any reasonably reputable financial organization who asks for it do n't get me started however credit cards run very differently essentially the onus is on the vendor to get the authorization which is why you can sign a credit card slip at the corner store or give your credit card details over the phone or fill in an online form and have your credit card account charged when you signed the credit card agreement you agreed to let people do this it 's also why the credit card company will reverse a transaction if you claim it was unauthorized so essentially paypal is like the specialty store you phone up to order something and give your credit card details to they have just as much authorization to charge your account your only protection is that the credit card company will investigate any transactions you claim are fraudulent and will reimburse you if it even if they ca n't recover the money themselves

scanned or electronic copies of invoices should be sufficient as long as they are accurate and you can deliver them during an audit also if you have an accountant prepare your taxes you would either need to provide them a copy of the invoices or a summary of them with the corresponding amounts to be claimed personally i prefer to print out a paper copy and file that away with that quarter 's and year 's other tax documents i do my own taxes and find paper copies handy as i can go through each invoice receipt and make sure i have entered its information by ticking it i find that when handling a large number of documents that paper copies are more easy to handle than electronic ones in the end you will need to use a system that you feel comfortable with and are able to use effectively
