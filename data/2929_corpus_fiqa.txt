it looks like you need a lot more education on the subject i suggest you pick up a book on investing and portfolio management to get a first idea dividend yields are currently way below 5 on blue chips unlike coupons from fixed income instruments which in the same risk category pay a lot less dividend yields are not guaranteed and neither is the invested principal amount   in either case your calculation is far away from reality   sure there are investments such as the mentioned direct investments in companies or in emerging economies that can potentially earn you two digit percentage returns just remember risk always goes both ways a higher earning potential means higher loss potential also a direct investment is a lot less liquid than an investment on a publicly quoted high turnover market place if you suddenly need money you really do n't want to be pressed to sell real estate in an emerging market keyword bid ask spread my advice the money that you can set aside for the long term 10 years plus invest it in stock etfs globally everything else should be invested in bond funds or even deposits depending on when you will need the access as others have pointed out consider getting professional advice

market rate of return averages about 8 annually sometimes more sometimes less or negative to get 30k monthly even taking that as pretax you 're talking about yearly divide that by 0.08 and you need to have savings of 4.5 and really you should double that for safety   tl;dr forget it added thought if you really have $ 20k month coming in you really have no business asking the internet for advice hire a professional financial advisor not a broker someone who is paid a flat fee for their expertise and has no incentives to give you less than optimal advice the money they will save make for you will more than pay for their hire

there is another factor to consider when refinancing is the remaining term left on your loan   if you have 20 years left and you re fi into another 30 year loan that extends the length that you will be paying off the house for another 10 years   you are probably better off going with 20 or even 15   if this is a new loan that is less of an issue although if you moving and buying a house in a similar price range it is still something to consider   my goal is to have my house paid off before i retire hopefully early semi retirement around 55

less demand for absurdly priced homes which means prices will drop to affordable levels   rent and home prices are obviously variable but in my area home prices are pretty aligned with rents   assuming both home prices and rent goes up with inflation and accounting for insurance taxes tax advantages maintenance and a list of other issues the prices are comparable   if you have the capital for a down payment and plan to stay in one house or for 5 years you are probably better off buying   to say home prices are absurd you need to be comparing it to what you consider it 's true worth but how are you determining that   edit perhaps both rent and home prices will go down as more people live with their parents and room mates but i have n't seen that trend start yet and vacancy rates are n't that high as far as i know so i do n't see it starting soon   if that trend did start i imagine new construction would be the first ones to go but housing developments are going strong around me

good observation in fact the s&p index itself is guilty of not including dividends so when you look at the index alone the delta between any two points in time and the 20 return observed if one fails to include dividends is meaningless in my my humble opinion yahoo finance will let you look at a stock ticker and offer you an adjusted close to include the dividend effect

if you apply for a mortgage with someone other than your current savings account provider they will not have access to this level of information   they will pull your credit report which contains information about debts and credit cards repayments amount borrowed etc and overdrafts as well as anything like against you but has no information about current or savings accounts other than who your main current account provider is you can and should check your credit report yourself to make sure there 's nothing incorrect on there this only costs a few pounds and you can find out about how to do this from the 3 main agencies here if you apply for a mortgage with the same provider that you use for your current account and savings account they could theoretically look at your account usage history in this level of detail however i would be very surprised if they had a problem with the type of activity you describe they 'll be looking more at whether you have regular income into your account whether you have frequently gone overdrawn without permission etc moving money around between accounts or having a fluctuating savings account balance is not even slightly a red flag

the fee to withdraw cash from an atm using your credit card as opposed to your debit card is akin to the merchant fees paid by any business that accepts your credit card as payment these fees range from around 2.75 of the transaction to upwards of 5 and are charged to the merchant the fees are split among the various vendors that provide the infrastructure to conduct the credit card transaction resulting in the merchant receiving the money and the charge on your credit account these fees are used by each vendor to cover their costs and ultimately generate a profit note most vendors in the value chain do not receive any revenue from any interest you may pay on your outstanding balance therefore when you withdraw cash from an atm you are paying the merchant fees instead of whatever merchant you are purchasing goods services from with the cash withdrawn

your relatively young age and the current very low bond interest rates make annuities a very poor buy and most of the other suggestions you have mentioned have very low diversification which exposes you to imprudent risks buying shares for dividend income can solve the diversification problem by averaging out your totals as different shares change by different amounts there is no really good solution to the problem of share price volatility except to ignore it take your dividends and pretty much ignore the bouncing around of the share price they usually recover in a year or three owning shares of companies that reliably increase their dividend payouts is the only investment type that gives you both diversification and regularly increasing income to counteract inflation over the years read some investment books and consider consulting with a financial advisor who charges a fee for the advice i.e. you do n't want free advice

as others have shown if you assume that you can get 6 and you invest 15 of a reasonable us salary then you can hit 1 million by the time you retire if you invest in property in a market like the uk where i come from then insane house price inflation will do it for you as well in 1968 my parents bought a house for Â£ 8000 they had a mortgage on it for about 75 of the value they do n't live there but that house is now valued at about Â£ 750,000 okay that 's close to 60 years but with a 55 year working life that 's not so unreasonable if you assume the property market or the shares market can go on rising forever then invest in as much property as you can with your 15 as mortgage payments and watch the million roll in of course you 've also got rent on your property portfolio as well in the intervening years however take the long view inflation will hit what a million is worth in 1968 a million was a ridiculously huge amount of money now it 's so what real rich people have billions you 'll get your million and it will not be enough to retire comfortably on in 1968 my parents salaries as skilled people were about Â£ 2000 a year equivalent jobs now pay closer to Â£ 50,000 25x salary inflation in the time do that again skilled professional salary in 60 years of Â£ a year so your million is actually 4 years salary   not being relentlessly negative just suggesting that a financial target like own a million dollars is n't a good strategy own something that yields a decent amount of money is a better one

for simplicity let 's start by just considering cash back in general cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable but for business use it is taxable sort of i 'll explain later the reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically are n't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income so if you purchase something that costs $ 100 and you receive $ 2 back from the cc company effectively you have paid $ 98 for that item but that would n't affect your tax bill however since businesses typically deduct most expenses that same $ 100 deduction would have only been a $ 98 deduction for business tax purposes so in this case the $ 2 should be accounted for note you should not consider that $ 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue it should be treated as a negative expense similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a cc refund now for your specific questions part 1 as a small business owner i wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business i have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare hotel and rental car will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt effectively no these expenses are not deductible if you deduct them they will be completely counter acted by the refund you receive for the payments part 2 does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card rather than a business credit card this is where it gets hairy suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement in this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards points cashback the trick is as the employee you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a do n't ask do n't tell rule that the irs is ok with it works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income however i would not go out of my way to abuse this loophole typically things like travel airfare hotel car rental meals are expected but i would n't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you the company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received or more realistically negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check part 3 would there be any difference between credit card points and brand loyalty points if the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company 's loyalty system not a cc would that yield a different result there is no difference perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement this is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity you ca n't call that a donation of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them but it ends up being a wash

when dividend is announced the stock and option price may react to that news but the actual payout of the dividend on the ex dividend date is what you probably are referring to the dividend payout affects the stock price on the ex dividend date as the stock price will drop by the amount of paid out dividend not taking into account other factors this in turn drives the prices of all options   the amount of change in the option price for this event is not only dependent the dividend payout but also on how far these are in our out of the money and what there time to expiration is the price of a call option that is far out of the money would react less than the price of a put that would be far in the money therefore i would argue that these two will not necessarily offset each other

robert is right saying that options prices are affected by implied volatility but is wrong saying that you have to look at the vix index for two reasons   1 the vix index is for s&p500 options only if you are trading other options it is less useful 2 if you are trading an option that is not at the money your implied volatility may be very different and follow a different dynamics that the vix index   so please look at the right implied volatility   in terms of strategy i do n't think that not doing anything is a good strategy i accept any point of view but you should consider that option traders should be able to adjust positions depending on market view   so you are long 1 call suppose strike 10 suppose the underlying price at the time of entry was 10 so the call was at the money now it 's 9   1 you still have a bullish view buy 1 call strike 9 and sell 2 calls strike 10 this way you have a bull call spread with much higher probability of leading to profit you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations   2 you become bearish you can sell 1 call strike 9 this way you end up with a bear call spread again you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations 3 you become neutral buy 1 call strike 8 and sell 2 calls strike 9 this way you end up with a call butterfly you are almost delta neutral and you can wait until your view becomes clear enough to become directional at that point you can modify the butterfly to make it directional   these are just some opportunities you have there is no reason for you to wait options are eroding contracts and you must be fast and adjust the position before time starts eroding your capital at risk   it 's true that buying a call does n't make you loose more than the premium you paid but it 's better to reduce this premium further with some adjustment is n't it   hope that helps

corporate taxes   mises daily wednesday july 09 2008 by sterling t.     lower corporate taxes are associated with economic growth this can be shown a and empirically   a   corporate taxes reduce the profits of business owners this is true because net income is reduced by the tax rate for example firm x with a $ 100 investment earning a 7 return has an income before taxes of $ 7 with a 10 corporate tax rate net income after taxes is $ firm x now has earned a 6.3 return in contrast a corporate tax rate of 40 reduces net income after taxes by $ 2.80 to $ or a 4.2 after tax return this rise in taxes on the margin reduces the profit seeking incentive to take business risks why risk starting a biotech company when inflation protected t bill 's will give you the same return entrepreneurs and venture capitalists less willing to take risk means less innovation and fewer innovative ideas being economically viable this results in less economic growth conversely higher returns on invested capital encourage investment and savings all of this leads to more capital savings more innovation better technology and higher wages   further the above example of firm x is true if the firm does not have the pricing ability to transfer the tax to its customers if the ability does exist an increase in the corporate tax rate is really a tax on customers of the firm in this case consumers now have less to spend and save and the end result is the same   finally a firm unable to pass on a tax increase or bear the reduced profit will either attempt to cut costs by reducing wages among other costs or be forced to go out of business   the main point is this by definition corporations do not pay taxes people pay taxes a corporate tax is either a tax on shareholders of the firm customers of the firm or employees of the firm less corporate tax means more innovation capital savings and spending by these groups also known as economic growth   empirically   after theory and logic tell us what is true can confirm our result   thankfully professors young lee university and gordon uc san diego have done the work for us in a 2005 journal article they concluded   this paper finds that the corporate tax rate is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth in a cross section data set of 70 countries during controlling for many other of economic growth   more specifically they continue the estimates suggest that cutting the corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points can increase the annual growth rate by around   using these figures andrew of the tax foundation   by cutting the u.s. 's combined federal and average state corporate tax rate from roughly 40 percent to 30 percent we could boost u.s. economic growth by around 1.1 percent per year enough to double our nation 's wealth every 63   even better a cut from the actual corporate tax rate of 35 to a rate of 10 would double our nation 's wealth every 30 years   life savers moved production to canada industries and tyco international moved to has announced a move to dubai in a economy is it really a puzzle that firms prefer to operate in lower taxing less regulated environments   these are examples of what can be seen as reminds us however it is imperative to also account for what can not be seen what would the wealth of our nation be today if the corporate tax rate had always been 10 or less what creature comforts would have been what new technologies brought to market what diseases cured   due to a history of high corporate taxes these answers are not known and we are worse off because of it   sterling t. is a ph.d. candidate in the department of agricultural and applied economics at texas tech university

the obvious thing would happen 10 shares change owner at the price of $ 100 a partially still open selling order would remain market orders without limits means to buy or sell at the best possible or current price however this is not very realistic usually there is a spread between the bid and the ask price and the reason is that market makers are acting in between they would immediately exploit this situation for example by placing appropriately limited orders orders without limits are not advisable for stocks with low trading activity would you buy or sell stuff without caring for the price

it seems that you are misunderstanding how your taxes are calculated you seem to be under the impression that once you pass $ annual income all of your income will be taxed at 25 however in reality only the income you earn above that amount will be taxed at 25 you can use this chart to determine exactly how much federal tax you will pay   as you can see if you earned $ in a year you would only be charged 25 taxes on $ 50 and you will pay 15 on the amount between $ and $ and 10 on the amount from $ 0 to $ which is $ when summed together

i have answered your question in detail here the annuity formula in fdic document is at first finding present value annuity due factor and multiplying it with annuity payment and then dividing it by an interest factor of to reduce the annuity to an ordinary annuity with end of period payments they could have simply used and multiplying it with annuity payment to find the present value of an ordinary annuity in any case you should not follow the directions in fdic document to find interest rate at which the present value of annuity equals the loan amount the method they are employing is commonly used by finance professors to teach their students how to find internal rate of return the method is prone to lengthy trial and error attempts without having any way of knowing what rate to use as an initial guess to kick off the interest rate calculations so this is what i would suggest if you are not short on time and would like to get yourself familiar with numerical methods or iterative techniques to find internal rate of return there are way too many methods at disposal when it comes to finding interest rates some of which include all of the above methods use a seed value as a guess rate to start the iterative calculations and if results from successive calculations tend to converge within a certain absolute error bound we assume that one of the rates have been found as there may be as many rates as the order of the polynomial in this case 36 there are however some other methods that help find all rates by making use of but for this you would need a lengthy discourse of linear algebra one of the methods that i have come across which was published in the us in 1969 the year i was born is called the method named after the two individuals who worked jointly on finding a solution to all roots of a polynomial any previous work on the same subject i been trying to go over the algorithm but am having difficulty understanding the complex nature of the calculations required to find all roots of the polynomial in summary you would be better of reading up on this site about the newton method to find irr

okay first of all and economic system needs division of labor to have much more efficiency and productivity which means people will do repetitive task and be very good at them decrease their cost of starting a new is a preparation time and cost which also suggest people wo n't be inclined to do the same stuff since it becomes pointless and could have existential crisis it is much fun and fulfilling   to do everything you need to done yourself like keeping care of your house making hunting taking care of health if family building your own house but is also much much less productive and also worse     making this part clear which is a long paragraph for a obvious fact people also need motivation for this which is money and statue these are the goals of everyone doing the same unnecessary stuff lets face it other than shelter food education and health things being done these days are no so quite a necessity   so unless humans became more capable of understanding these are just made up dreams that we had made which makes the system go on otherwise it will collapse and understand the real inner reason for these dreams self fulfillment    attention whatsoever this economic system will continue i understand my response was economically related and was sort of edgy this is my sincere thoughts on the topic i also think this economic model wo n't change unless 2 reasons systems changes which i find likely in 50 years time and people will just give up in democracy since it is being used much worse than monarchy war that has never been written in history before which would change the economic system entirely since most of the economic system in with different and most economic activities are not material but services entertainment and other which has no use in war economy

you need to have 3 things if you are considering short term trading which i absolutely do not recommend the ability to completely disconnect your emotions from your gains and losses yes even your gains but especially your losses the winning losing on a daily basis will cause you to start taking unnecessary risk in order to win again if you ca n't disconnect your emotions then this is n't the game for you   the lowest possible trading costs to enter and exit a position people will talk about 1 trading costs that rule of thumb does n't apply anymore personally my trading costs are a total basis points to enter and exit a $ 10,000 position and i think it 's still too high that 's just a hair above one of 1 for you non traders   the ability to gut check and exit a losing position fast do n't hesitate and do n't hope for it to go up gtfo if you are serious about short term trading then you must close all positions on a daily basis   do n't do margin in today 's market as many valuations are high and some industries are not trending as they have in the past the leverage will kill you it 's not a question of if it 's a when   you 're new do n't trade anything larger than a $ 5,000 position no matter what do n't hold more than 10 of your portfolio in the same industry do n't be afraid to sit on 50 cash or more for months at a time use money market funds to park cash because they are t+1 settlement and most firms will let you trade the stock without cash as long as you effect the money market trade on the same day since stock settlement is t+3

this does not directly address the question but how the bank views your behaviour is not the same as a credit reporting bureau   if you do not go deep on your card at all you may be deemed not to be exercising the facility indeed they may ask you to reduce your credit limit this is not the same as missing a payment at the same time do not just make the minimum payment ideally you should clear it within 3 months think of it as a very short term line of credit not clearing the balance within three months or turning it over demonstrates a cash flow problem as does clearing it from another card some banks call this flying after similar behaviour in older days with cheque accounts if you use the credit and show you can pay it off you should never need to ask for a credit increase it will be offered the bureau will be informed of these offers also depending upon how much the bank trusts you the bureau may see a monthly periodic credit review which is good if you have no delinquencies amex does this as a rule

a company 's valuation includes its assets in addition to projected earnings aside from the obvious issue that projected earnings can be wildly inaccurate or speculative as in the case of startups and fast moving industries like technology a company 's assets are not necessarily tied to the market the company is in for the sake of illustration say the government were to ban fast food tomorrow and the market for that were to go all the way to zero   mcdonald 's would still have almost 30 billion dollars worth of real estate holdings that would surely make the company worth something even though it would have to stop selling its products similarly apple is sitting on approximately $ 200 billion dollars in cash and securities in overseas subsidiaries   even if they never make another cent selling iphones and such the company is still worth a lot because of those holdings corporate raiders back in the 70 's and 80 's made massive personal fortunes exploiting this disconnect in undervalued companies that had more assets than their market cap by getting enough ownership to liquidate the company 's assets   oliver stone even made a movie about the phenomenon so yes it 's certainly possible for a company to be worth more than the size of the market for its products

us checking accounts are not really secure though many people use them one form of check fraud has been highlighted by prof donald and carried out by frank as portrayed in the film catch me if you can basically anyone can write a check that would draw from your account merely by knowing your account number and your bank 's aba routing number   with those two pieces of information which are revealed on every check that you write anyone can print a working check either using a laser printer with micr magnetic ink character recognition toner or by placing an order with a check printing company   the only other missing element is a signature which is a pretty weak form of authentication when presented with such a check your bank would probably honor it before finding out too late that it is fraudulent a variant of this vulnerability is ach funds transfers   this is the mechanism through which you could have say your utility company automatically withdraw money from your account to pay your bill   unfortunately the transfer is initiated by the recipient and the system relies largely on trust with some statistical monitoring for suspicious patterns basically the whole us checking system is built with convenience rather than security in mind since other institutions are able to initiate withdrawal transactions by knowing just the aba number and account number   in practice it works well enough for most people but if you are paranoid about security as you seem to be you do n't want to be using checks the european system which has largely eliminated checks in favor of payer initiated push transactions is safer by design

your math is correct these kind of returns are possible in the capital markets by the way google finance shows something completely different for $ than my trading console in thinkorswim tos shows a high of $ 201 but i believe there may have been some reverse splits that are not accurately reflected in either of these charts the problems with this strategy are liquidity and timing let 's talk about liquidity because that is a greater factor here than the random psychological factors that would have affected you long long before your $ 1,000 allowance was worth a million dollars if you bought $ 1000 worth of this stock at $ .05 share this would have been 20,000 shares the week of october 11th 2011 during the entire week only 5,000 shares were traded from this alone you can see that it would have been impossible for you to even acquire 20,000 shares for yourself at $ .05 because there was nobody to sell them to you we ca n't even look at the next week because there were no trades whatsoever so we have to skip all the way to november 11th where indeed over 30,000 shares were traded but this pushed the price all the way up to $ 2.00 again there was no way you could have gotten 20,000 shares at $ .05 so now lets talk about liquidation of your shares after several other highs and lows in the $ 20s and $ 30s are you telling me that after holding this stock for 2 years you have taken a $ 500,000 profit at $ 25.00 we are talking about someone that is investing with $ 1,000 here i have my doubts that there was no time between october 2011 and january 2014 that you did n't think hm this extra $ 100,000 would be really useful right now sell lets say you actually held your $ 1,000 to $ there were exactly two days where that was the top of the market and in those two days the volume was shares one day and shares the next day this is barely enough time for you to sell your shares because you would have been the majority of the volume most likely the sell side quotes as soon as the market saw your sell order there would be a massive selloff of people trying to sell before you do because they could barely get their shares filled not enough buyers let alone someone with five times the amount of shares that day yes you could have made a lot of money doing that simplistic math does not tell you the whole story

i agree with the rest of the answers you 're probably better off just using it for some predictable flat rate recurring monthly service like netflix or making a charitable donation if you 're into that sort of thing but since that was n't what you asked i 'll try to provide an answer if you do n't mind throwing away money send money to yourself using paypal here 's how   set up a paypal business account and use your personal paypal account to send funds to it by setting up a paypal subscription paypal says you can have one consumer account and one business account a paypal payments standard business account has no monthly fee only transaction fees according to paypal in order to set up a repeating payment you would need to create a subscription or recurring payments button from the merchant services tab in the business account you would then click the link button to set up the subscription from your personal paypal account to make it send money to your business account on an automatic schedule you can then at your own leisure send the money back to your personal account without paying a second transaction fee then finally send it back to your bank account or if your bank account is not yet tied to your personal account you can tie it to the business account instead and deposit the funds into your bank account unfortunately this step ca n't be automated again to reiterate you 're much better off just using it for something recurring

this answer is applicable to the us   similar rules may hold in some other countries as well    the shares in an open ended non exchange traded mutual fund are not traded on stock exchanges and the market does not determine the share price the way it does for shares in companies as brokers make offers to buy and sell stock shares the price of one share of   the mutual fund usually called net asset value nav per share is usually calculated at the close of business and is as the name implies the net worth of all the shares in companies that the fund owns plus cash on hand etc divided by the number of mutual fund shares outstanding the nav per share of a mutual fund might or might not increase in anticipation of the distribution to occur but the nav per share very definitely falls on   the day that the distribution is declared if you choose to re invest your distribution in the same fund then you will own more shares at a lower nav per share but the total value of your investment will not change at all   if you had 100 shares currently priced at $ 10 and   the fund declares a distribution of $ 2 per share you will   be reinvesting $ 200 to buy more shares but the fund will be selling you additional shares at $ 8 per share and of course the 100 shares you hold will be priced at $ 8 per share too   so you will have 100 previous shares worth only $ 800 now + 25 new shares worth $ 200 for a total of 125 shares at $ 8 = $ 1000 total investment just as before if you take the distribution in cash then you still hold the 100 shares but they are worth only $ 800 now and the fund will send you the $ 200 as cash either way there is no change in your net worth however assuming that the fund is is not in a tax advantaged account that $ 200 is taxable income to you regardless of whether you reinvest it or take it as cash the fund will tell you what part of that $ 200 is dividend income as well as what part is qualified dividend income   what part is short term capital gains and what part is long term capital gains you declare the income in the appropriate categories on your tax return and are taxed accordingly so what advantage is there in re investing well your basis in those shares has increased and so if and when you sell the shares you will owe less tax if you had bought the original 100 shares at $ 10 and sell the 125 shares a few years later at $ 11 and collect $ you owe long term capital gains tax on   just $ = $ 175   which can also be calculated as $ 1 gain on each of the original 100 shares = $ 100 plus $ 3 gain on the 25 new shares = $ 175 in the past some people would forget the intermediate transactions and think that they had invested $ 1000 initially and gotten $ back for a gain of $ 375 and pay taxes on $ 375 instead this is less likely to occur now since mutual funds are now required to report more information on the sale to the than they used to in the past so should you buy shares in a mutual fund right now most mutual fund companies publish preliminary estimates in november and december of what distributions each fund will be making by the end of the year they also usually advise against purchasing new shares during this period because one ends up buying a dividend   if for example you bought those 100 shares at $ 10 on the friday after thanksgiving and the fund distributes that $ 2 per share   on december 15 you still have $ 1000 on december 15 but now owe taxes on $ 200 that you would not have had to pay if you had postponed buying those shares till after the distribution was paid for simplicity of i have not gone into the detailed of when the fund goes ex dividend when the distribution is recorded   and when cash is paid out etc but merely treated all these events as happening simultaneously

i have a very specific mba in sustainable business and my thoughts always go to that topic so this might be more detailed than you 'd like    i think it 'd be interesting to assess how the proliferation of digital communication which manifests as much more transparency and an informed consumer base has affected international supply chain sustainability and the response of management    corporate social responsibility has grown exponentially in the last few decades how much is that because it 's a lot harder to hide bad behavior with social media allowing for more niche activism

it probably would have already been priced in the moment the markets opened today so my guess is unless you already owned it at $ on friday chances are it would have been near impossible to get it at that price since this morning it already increased more than 18 from the opening bell today    hope my answer helped clarify some things

i can see two possibilities either a deal is struck that someone the company itself or a large owner buys out the remaining shares this is the scenario @mbhunter is talking about so i wo n't go too deeply into it but it simply means that you get money in your bank account for the shares in question the same as if you were to sell them for that price in turn possibly triggering tax effects etc i imagine that this is by far the most common approach the other possibility is that the stock is simply de listed from a public stock exchange and not re listed elsewhere in this case you will still have the stock and it will represent the same thing a portion of the company but you will lose out on most of the market part of stock market that is the shares will still represent a monetary value you will have the same right to a portion of the company 's profits as you do now etc but you will not have the benefit of the market setting a price per share so current valuation will be harder should you wish to buy or sell stock you will have to find someone yourself who is interested in striking a deal with you at a price point that you feel comfortable with

before you decide on moving into trading whether you have experience or not you need to sort out a couple of questions how much do you really understand about the markets   how much money you have and what would be the maximum loss you may be able to take   what supporting eco system you have to help you in terms of trading i.e. hardware software research connections who can provide you with solid information and sorts of it are you really prepared to take on institutions who have billions to spend and take losses i.e. amounts which might break you will be peanuts for them i am assuming you are in us so this website   may help you a bit trading websites where you can open an account   even if you reply in affirmative to the above questions you should still be wary about making money by trading it is a field where even the best people have been in the face without any mercy and above all do n't expect any person will take mercy on your hard earned cash they will take you to the cleaners if they have to there are some websites which allow you to participate in trading not involving real money try that out and see where you get to that should give you some pointers on where you are headed   and realize that it is human nature to assume when you hear news that such and such trader make loads of money in such and such trades trading is easy unless you do it for yourself the truth is such traders would be on their desk for 18 20 hours at a stretch 6 7 days a week without a life to make such money and they have loads of support staff i.e. analysts it guys who makes it easier for them do you have such help if no then look the other side   but giving up without trying at all will be but do it in limits which you can bear and not to get carried away when things are good

advantages of buying with every mortgage payment you build equity while with rent once you sign the check the money is gone eventually you will own the house and can live there for free you can or remodel to your own liking rather than being stuck with what the landlord decides is attractive cost effective etc here in the u.s. there are tax breaks for homeowners i 'm not sure if that 's true in u.k. advantages of renting if you decide to move you may be stuck paying out a lease but the financial penalty is small with a house you may find it difficult to sell you may be stuck accepting a big loss or having to pay a mortgage on the empty house while you are also paying for your new place when there are maintenance issues you call the landlord and it 's up to him to fix it you do n't have to come up with the money to pay for repairs you usually have less maintenance work to do with a house you have to mow the lawn clear snow from the driveway etc with a rental usually the landlord does that for you not always depends on type of rental but you can often buy a house for less than it would cost to rent an equivalent property but this can be misleading when you buy you have to pay property taxes and pay for maintenance when you rent these things are included in the rent how expensive a house you can afford to buy is not a question that can be answered objectively banks have formulas that limit how much they will loan you but in my experience that 's always been a rather high upper bound much more than i would actually be comfortable borrowing the biggest issue really is how important is it to you to have a nice house if your life long dream is to have a big luxurious expensive house then maybe it 's worth it to you to pour every spare penny you have into the mortgage other people might prefer to spend less on their house so that they have spare cash for a nice car concert tickets video games cocaine whatever bear in mind that if you get a mortgage that you can just barely afford what do you do if something goes wrong and you ca n't afford it any more what if you lose your job and have to take a lower paying job what if some disaster strikes and you have some other huge expense etc on the flip side the burden of a mortgage usually goes down over time most people find that their incomes go up over time between inflation and growing experience but the amount of a mortgage is fixed or if it varies it varies with interest rates probably bouncing up and down rather than going steadily up like inflation so it 's likely not at all certain but likely that if you can just barely afford the payment now that in 5 or 10 years it wo n't be as big a burden

you obviously pay your taxes in switzerland and are employed judging from your comments on your maximum possible contribution to the 3 under these circumstances your best best may well be to pay into the occupational pension system in die 2 essentially you can add funds to your pension plan to match non existent employer contributions from times you spent studying etc the 2 is usually invested in bonds so it 's not a completely secure investment in addition it 's a pretty fixed investment since you can only get your money out if you buy a house or leave switzerland for good however your entire payment into the 2 is tax deductible so the tax effect in itself should be a very attractive bit of interest your pension plan can inform you about the maximum possible

without running the numbers if they are close i prefer a 401 k over db   with a 401 k the money is yours with a db you are at the mercy of the employer   two things could happen   you could lose your job or they could just take away or reduce the db    in my mind db is much higher risk than 401k.

recycled toner cartridges spill excess toner all over the of printers causing higher maintenance costs and shorter life spans for other consumable components such as the the reason this occurs is that the drum assembly has a conductive coating on it that wears out after the cartridge 's service life once that coating is weakened or removed it can no longer keep excess toner from spilling out i 'd say a good 95 of recycled are just drill and fill so the old drum remains unchanged   even changing the drum does n't work all the time hp uses a special coating on their drums which is n't replicated when an aftermarket drum is used

if the employees keep it up then it would make sense for walmart to raise their wages because they would not be able to find employees without raising the wage   if walmart is always able to find employees who will work at minimum wage though it can be argued that the minimum wage is what that job is worth both to the employees otherwise no one would take the job and employers   of course this does not necessarily mean it is completely compassionate to do so since it is always nice to give people more money it does show that this is efficient using the economics sense of the word

yes it 's unreasonable to think the prices will drop 10 20 in that time frame   housing prices are not an equation that can can be solved to home prices are x% overvalued you have 3 answers so far 's prices are inversely proportional to rates rob 's there 's no strong correlation between interest rates and house prices and mb 's rising interest rates create downward pressure on housing prices any research into price history had better take every other variable into account articles that look at rates vs price do n't always address a key item income say we agree that the data show your city to be 10 too high but if sellers like their high price and have some dig my heels in power prices wo n't drop the seller simply stays put and the supply demand curves result not in a lower price but in less supply and the effect is to change the demographic of that area i.e. attracting higher income earners   rob linked to an article with a nice set of charts one chart showing the yr fixed rate and real house prices what results is a chart that can refute the relationship between rates and prices but that would ignore an historical point that 's too important to forget the tumble that started in jan 06 had nothing to do with the 30 year rate it was the result of a series of insane financial products including interest only option arms which permitted buyers to get approved for a purchase based on a payment that was n't fixed and would change to a fully amortizing mortgage at a higher rate that was unaffordable a product that was a financial time bomb canada banks offered no such product and when the us market got canada experienced a mild cold with respect to any answers that offer us centric data to prove any hypothesis i do n't feel such comparisons are appropriate   correlations and the data used to prove them are an interesting thing i can suggest that you take the us 30 year rate along with our median income or rather 25 of monthly median income calculate the mortgage that results this translates nicely to the home a median family can afford and i claim that long term this is the equilibrium price of that median home but supply demand has another factor or the more technical term of demand this means that for example a 10 increase in the price of cigarettes does not cause a 10 drop in consumption each and every good has its own elasticity and in the case of housing a rise in cost would certainly impact the marginal buyers but others will simply adjust their budgets not all buyers were planning to hit the bank 's limit on what they could afford so the rise does n't change their mind just their budget   last i know that canada does not have a 30 year mortgage most common is a 5 year rate with 30 year amortization correction clarification anyone the effect of this is less volatility in the market since i believe your rates are not poised for the 2.5 to 4 jump implied by another response small increases can be absorbed   in a beautiful coincidence the federal reserve board sent me a link to the interest rate elasticity of mortgage demand evidence from at the conforming loan limit it 's a bit long but a worthwhile look at how the correlation is n't as instant as some might think

many companies actually just issue new shares for employee compensation instead of buying back existing ones so actually the share price should go down because the same value is now diluted over more shares in addition this would not necessarily affect companies with many employees than those with fewer employees because companies with more employees tend to be bigger and thus have more shares among which the change in demand would be distributed also i think many companies do not issue shares to employees every pay day but just e.g. once every quarter

your question has an interesting mix of issues asap and 3 4 years does n't feel like the same thing asap results in bad decisions made in four years of living very frugally can create a nice down payment on a house       a car is only an investment for uber drivers and those who are directly financially benefitting from a car 's use for everyone else it 's a necessary expense   what i 'd focus on is the decision of buying a plot of land unless this is a very common way to do it in your country i do n't recommend that order having land and then trying to finance the building of a house has far more complexity than most people need in their lives in my opinion the better way is to save the 20 down and buy a new or existing home you can afford   in the end spending is a matter of priority if you truly want to get out in the least time i 'd save every dime i can and start looking for a house that your income can support

close warning i may be off a bit here i 'm sure someone will correct me if so traditional 401k or ira money goes in pre tax so yes you avoid paying tax on it now grows untaxed taxes are due when you retire and start taking money back out of the account but your income including these withdrawals is likely to be lower than your peak earning years so your tax rate will be lower you do n't avoid all the tax but you delay it and hopefully reduce it and by doing so there 's more money in your account earning returns roth 401k or ira money goes in after taxes you do pay income tax now however all returns on the money are untaxed i believe and you pay no tax when you 're eligible to withdraw the funds   either or both kinds of 401k may be eligible for some percentage of matching funds from your employer there are some incentives for them to offer this benefit i believe that even if you 're doing a roth 401k the matching funds legally have to go in as traditional plan and yes as that implies it is possible to split your contribution between the two styles note the matching funds are free money if your plan offers a match it is highly recommended that you contribute enough to your 401k to capture the maximum match

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

as you have n't specified country will try and answer more in general whole life insurance but it seems to be the first thing any financial adviser is trained to sell the commission structure is such that it makes more attractive for a financial adviser to sell whole life plus for most buyers its easier to sell whole life compared to term the way guarantees are worded differ from policy to policy most of them do not give any guarantee its the adviser where there is guarantee it would be similar to a interest on bank deposit debt fund plus there are various terms used in the policy the guarantee may not be on sum assured but on the policy value that would be low in essence you are right on investing the difference into any save instruments like bank deposits certain debit funds government bonds retirement funds etc that would essentially give you more returns than what s promised in the whole life policy

all of these answers are great but i wanted to add one piece of advice from someone who has been married 8 years and been in various financial situations have one of you whoever the two of you feel is more organized and more financially responsible be solely in charge of paying the monthly bills but keep a spreadsheet or some other tracking mechanism so that the other can monitor this as well that way if you guys ever decide to switch roles there wo n't be much of a learning curve also do n't do three bank accounts one or two is enough more than that starts becoming more difficult to keep track of and if you have any sort of monthly fees on the accounts it also wastes money my wife and i each have our own account and we get money for each other if necessary she handles paying the bills but keeps a monthly spreadsheet that has all pertinent info we have a number and color coding system to determine which paycheck 1st or 2nd of the month the bill is paid in and whether it has been paid not paid or past due green yellow red hopefully you do n't ever have to see the red color :p

i recommend saving for retirement first to leverage compound interest over a long time horizon the historical real return on the stock market has been about 7   assuming returns stay at 7 in the future big assumption but do n't have any better numbers to go off of then $ 8,000 saved today will be worth $ in 40 years 1.07 ^ 40 8000   having a sizable retirement portfolio will give you peace of mind as you progress through life and make other expenditures if you buy assets that pay you money and appreciate you will be in a better financial position than if you buy assets that require significant cash outflows i.e. property taxes interest you pay to the bank etc or assets that ultimately depreciate to zero a car   as a young person you are well positioned to pay yourself not the bank or the car dealership and leverage compound interest over a long time horizon

ah but that 's not how the game is played there are no free lunches but there are lunches that are free or mostly free to individuals as someone on the receiving end of a pension your only objective is to lock in the highest average payout the cost of that will be borne by shareholders and customers of the business so a higher number is always better right up to the point that the company folds and because of the pbgc there is a discount on the risk of the company being dragged under by its pension costs even if the company goes under the pensioners still probably get something*. likewise it 's in a company 's best interest to pensions as much as possible paying pensions from free cash flow keeps the least dollars tied up in poor investments leaving the company the most room to manage its assets efficiently likewise corporate bosses also know that they can be aggressive with   pension promises because they are allowed to under fund those liabilities it 's a taxpayer backed just because taxpayers are n't paying up front does n't mean they are n't the lender of last resort that 's just a political reality there 's no waiting to bail my ass out if the market crashes

all you have to do is ask warren buffet that question and you 'll have your answer grin   he is the very definition of someone who relies on the fundamentals as a major part of his investment decisions investors who rely on analysis of fundamentals tend to be more long term strategic planners than most other investors who seem more focused on momentum based thinking there are some industries which have historically low p e ratios such as utilities but i do n't think that implies poor growth prospects   how often does a utility go out of business    i think oftentimes if you really look into the numbers there are companies reporting higher earnings and earnings growth but is that top line growth or is it the result of cost cutting and other measures which artificially imply a healthy and growing company   a healthy company is one which shows year over year organic growth in revenues and earnings from sales not one which has to continually make new acquisitions or use accounting tricks to dress up the bottom line is it possible to do well by investing in companies with solid fundamentals   absolutely   you may not realize the same rate of short term returns as others who use momentum based trading strategies but over the long haul i 'm willing to bet you 'll see a better overall average return than they do

this is not a mistake this is done for out of network providers and mainly when the patient is an anthem member be it blue shield or blue cross even though an assignment of benefits is completed by the patient and all fields on the claim from or are completed assigning the benefits to the provider anthem has placed in their policy that the assignment of benefits the patient signs is null and void   no other carrier that i have come across conducts business in this manner is it smart absolutely not they have now consumed their member 's time in trying to figure out which provider the check is actually for the member now is responsible for forwarding the payment or the patient spends the check thinking anthem made a mistake on their monthly premium at some point odds are slim and is now in debt thousands of dollars because they do n't check with anthem   it creates a huge mess for providers not only have we anthem for payment but now we have to chase the patient and 50 of the time never see the payment in our office it creates more phone calls to anthem but what do they care they are paying pennies on the dollar for their representatives in the philippines to read from a script   anthem is the second largest insurance carrier in the us their profit was over 800 million dollars within 3 months the way they see it we issued payment so stop calling us it 's amazing how they can accept a but not follow the guidelines associated with it   your best bet and what we suggest to patients either deposit the check and write your a personal check or endorse and forward i personally would deposit the check and write a personal check for tracking purposes however keep in mind that in the future you may depend on your bank statements for proof of income e.g. social security and imagine the work having to explain and prove a $ 20,000 deposit and withdraw within the same month

i feel dividends are better for shareholders the idea behind buy backs is that future profits are split between fewer shares thereby increasing the value not necessarily price that 's a market function of the remaining shares this that the company then retires the shares it repurchases but quite often buybacks simply offset dilution from stock option compensation programs in my opinion some stock option compensation is acceptable but overuse of this becomes a form of wealth transfer from the shareholder to management the opposite of shareholder friendly but let 's assume the shares are being retired that 's good but at what cost the company must use cashflow cash to pay for the shares the buyback is only a positive for shareholders if the shares are undervalued managers can be very astute in their own sphere running their business estimating a reasonable range of intrinsic value for their shares is a difficult and very subjective task requiring many assumptions about future revenue and margins a few managers like warren buffett are very competent capital but most managers are n't that good in this area and being so close to the company they 're often overly optimistic so they end up overpaying if a company 's shares are worth say $ 30 it 's not unreasonable to assume they may trade all around that number maybe as low as $ 15 and as high as $ 50 this is overly simplistic but assuming the value does n't change that the company is in steady state mode then the $ 30 point the intrinsic value estimate will act as a for the market price eventually it toward the value point well if management does n't understand this they could easily pay $ 50 for the repurchased stock heck companies routinely just continue buying stock with no apparent regard for the price they 're paying this is one of the quickest ways to shareholder capital overpaying for dubious acquisitions is another dividends on the other hand require no estimates they ca n't mask other activities other agendas they do n't transfer wealth from shareholders to management us companies traditionally pay quarterly and they try very hard not to cut the dividend many companies grow the dividend steadily at a rate several times that of inflation the dividend is an actual cash expenditure there 's no gaap reporting to get in the way of what 's really going on the company must be fiscally conservative and responsible or risk not having the cash when they need to pay it out the shareholder gets the cash and can then reinvest as he she sees fit with available opportunities at the time including buying more shares of the company if undervalued but if overvalued the money can be invested in a better safer opportunity

you can do either a 1099 or a w-2   there is no limitations to the number of w-2s one can have in reporting taxes   problems occur with the irs when one forgets to report income   even if one holds only one job at a time people typically have more than one w-2 if they change jobs within the year the w-2 is the simplest way to go and you may want to consider doing this if you do not intend to work this side business into significant income    however a 1099 gig is preferred by many in some situations   for things like travel expenses you will probably receive the income from these on a 1099 but you can deduct them from your income using a schedule c.   along these lines you may be able to deduct a wide variety of other things like travel to and from the client 's location equipment such as computers and office supplies and maybe a portion of your home internet bill   also this opens up different retirement contributions schemes such as a simplified employee pension    this does come with some drawbacks however   first your life is more complicated as things need to be documented to become actual business expenses   you are much more likely to be audited by the irs   your taxes become more complicated and it is probably necessary to employee a cpa to do them   if you do this for primary full time work you will have to buy your own benefits   most telling you will have to pay both sides of social security taxes on most profits   keep in mind that a good account can help you transfer profits to dividends which will allow you to be taxed at 15 and avoid social security taxes so it really comes down to what you see this side gig expanding into and your goals   if you want to make this a real business then go 1099 if you are just doing this for a months and a few thousand dollars go w-2

note that long term you need to plan for possible inflation so a little bit of return   generally wants to be at least high enough to offset that plus a little bit which is why just shoving it in a bank while extremely safe is n't usually the best choice    you need to make some decisions about how you trade off risk versus return whether you will comfortable riding out a downturn while waiting for recovery and so on my standard advice as someone else who knows how little he knows it 's worth spending a few hundred of those dollars to talk to a real financial planner not someone who has any interest in selling you particular products like a broker or agent they can help you ask yourself the right questions about comfort and goals and timeframe to pick a strategy which suits your needs it wo n't be exciting but it sounds luke you agree with me that this should n't be exciting and market rate of return about 8 annually long term is generally good enough with more conservative positions as you approach the point of needing that money

am i allowed to transfer into nre account from paypal credits into nre accounts are restricted it has to be established that the funds being credited are income outside of india in case of paypal paypal uses local clearing to credit funds into bank accounts so essentially one can not credit nre account by domestic clearing network like it is best that you withdraw the funds into bank account outside india and use swift or remittance service to credit your nre account i do not want to transfer to an nro account since the money credited into it will become taxable this is not the right assumption credits into nro are not taxable by default if you establish that the funds are from outside india there is no tax on the income money transferred from abroad into the nro account however the interest that will be paid by the bank on the balance of the nro account is taxable income in india and is subject to tds in contrast interest paid on the balance in an nre account is not taxable in india and is not subject to tds as long as you maintain nri status however it does make sense to keep accounts segregated i.e. income generated in india credit the nro account and income generated outside india credit to nre

consider property taxes school municipal county etc summing to 10 of the property value   so each year another is removed   assume the property value rises with inflation   allow for a 5 after inflation return on a 70/30 stock bond mix for n.    after inflation return    let 's assume a 20 rate   and let 's bump the after inflation to before inflation   inflation is still taxable    result   drop in value of investment funds due to purchase    return after inflation    after inflation return minus property taxes    taxes are on the return including inflation so we 'll assume and a 20 rate may be lower than that but better safe than sorry    amount left    if no property you would have to live on after taxes   but with the property that drops to   given the constraints of the problem could be anywhere from $ 8k to $ 80k    so if we ignore housing can you live on $ 8k a year   if so then no problem   if not then you need to constrain n more or make do with less house    on the bright side you do n't have to pay rent out of the   you still need housing out of the without the house    these formulas should be considered examples   i do n't know how much your property taxes might be   nor do i know how much you 'll pay in taxes   heck i do n't know that you 'll average a 5 return after inflation   you may have to put some of the money into cash equivalents with negligible return   but this should allow you to research more what your situation really is    if we set returns to 3.5 after inflation and 2.4 after inflation and taxes that changes the numbers slightly but importantly   the no house number becomes   the with house number becomes   so that 's $ 24,000 which needs to include rent versus no rent needed   there is not enough money in that plan to have any remainder to live on in the with house option   given the constraints for n and these assumptions about returns you would be $ 800 to $ 8000 short every year    this continues to assume that property taxes are 10 of the property value annually   lower property taxes would of course make this better   higher property taxes would be even less feasible    when comparing to people with homes remember the option of selling the home   if you sell your home for and buy a condo instead that 's not just more that is invested   you 'll also have less tied up with property taxes   it 's a lot easier to live on $ 20k than $ 8k    or do a reverse mortgage where the lender pays the property taxes   you 'll get some more savings up front have a place to live while you 're alive and save money annually    there are options with a house that you do n't have without one

rich 's answer captures the basic essence of short selling with example i 'd like to add these additional points you typically need a specially privileged brokerage account to perform short selling   if you did n't request short selling when you opened your account odds are good you do n't have it and that 's good because it 's not something most people should ever consider doing   short selling is an advanced trading strategy   be sure you truly selling short before doing it consider that when buying stock a.k.a going long or taking a long position in contrast to short then your potential loss as a buyer is limited i.e. stock goes to zero and your potential gain unlimited stock keeps going up if you 're lucky    whereas with short selling it 's reversed your loss can be unlimited stock keeps going up if you 're unlucky and your potential gain is limited i.e. stock goes to zero    the proceeds you receive from a short sale and then some need to stay in your account to offset the short position   brokers require this   typically margin equivalent to 150 the market value of the shares sold short must be maintained in the account while the short position is open the owner of the borrowed shares is still expecting his dividends if any   you are responsible for covering the cost of those dividends out of your own pocket   to close or cover your short position you initiate a buy to cover   this is simply a buy order with the intention that it will close out your matching short position    you may be forced to cover your short position before you want to and when it is to your disadvantage   even if you have sufficient margin available to cover your short there are cases when lenders need their shares back   if too many short sellers are forced to close out positions at the same time they push up demand for the stock increasing price and their losses   when this happens it 's called a short squeeze in the eyes of the public who mostly go long buying stock short sellers are often however some people and many short sellers believe they are providing balance to the market and preventing it sometimes from getting ahead of itself a short sale in the stock market is not related to the real estate concept of a short sale which is when a property owner sells his property for less than he owes the bank additional references

open an investment account on your own and have them roll the old 401 k accounts into either a roth or traditional ira do not leave them in old 401k accounts and definitely do n't roll them into your new employer 's 401k. why well as great as 401 k accounts are there is one thing that employers rarely mention and the 401 k companies actively try to hide     most 401 k plans are loaded with huge fees you wo n't see them on your statements they are often hidden very cleverly with accounting tricks for example in several plans i have participated in the mutual fund symbols may look like the ones you see on the stock tickers but if you read the fine print they only approximate the underlying mutual fund they are named for that is if you multiply the number of shares by the market price you will arrive at a number higher than the one printed on your statement   the spread between those numbers is the fee charged by the 401 k management company and since employees do n't pick that company and ca n't easily fire them they are n't very competitive unless your company is really large and has a tough negotiator in hr if you work for a small company you are probably getting slammed by these fees also they often charge fees for the automatic rebalancing service they offer to do annually to your account to keep your allocation in line with your current contribution allocations   i have no idea why it is legal for them not to disclose these fees on the statements but they do n't i had to do some serious digging to find this out on my own and when i did it was downright scary in one case they were siphoning off over 3 annually from the account using this standard practice however that is not to say that you should n't participate in these plans especially if there is an employer match there are fees with any investment account and the free money your employer is kicking in almost always offsets these fees my point here is just that you should n't keep the money in the 401 k after you leave the company when you have an option to move it to an account with much cheaper fees

first to actually answer the question how long at these rates   these is nothing magic or nefarious about what the bank is doing they add accrued interest and take your payment off the new total   i 'd make higher payments to the 8.75 debt until it 's gone $ 100/mo extra and be done the first debt if you bump it to $ 50 will be paid in 147 months at $ 92 months everything you pay above the minimum goes right to the principal balance and gets you closer to paying it off   the debt snowball is not the ideal way to pay off your debt say i have one 24 credit card the bank was nice enough to give me a $ 20,000 line of credit on i also have 20 cards each with $ 1000 in credit all at 6 the snowball dictates that the smallest debt be paid first so while i pay the minimum on the 24 card the 6 cards get paid off one by one but i 'm supposed to feel good about the process as i reduce the number of cards every few months   the correct way to line up debt is to pay off the tax adjusted highest rate first as an extra $ 100 to the 24 card saves you $ vs 50 cents mo for the 6 cards i wrote an article discussing the debt snowball which links to a calculator where you can see the difference in methods i note that if the difference from lowest to highest rate is small the snowball method will only cost you a small amount more if by coincidence the balances are close the difference will also be small   the above aside it 's the rest of your situation that will tell you the right path for you for example a matched 401(k deposit should take priority over most debt repayment the $ 11,000 might be better for a house downpayment as that $ is student loan and wo n't count as the housing debt rather other debt and part of the higher ratio when qualifying for the mortgage if you already have taken this into account by all means pay off the 8.75 debt asap then start paying off the 3 faster keep in mind this is likely the lowest rate debt one can have and once paid off you ca n't withdraw it again so it 's important to consider the big picture first   are you depositing to a retirement account is it a 401(k and are you getting any matching from the company

yes but at the root of it is the consumer complaining that these trusted sources are not adhering to principles of journalistic integrity while they are desperately trying to survive thrive and adapt to a completely shifting paradigm where competition is lowering the bar and the same consumers are unwilling to step up and reward journalistic integrity this is what happens essentially we get what we pay for    we can lay blame on the media organizations as much as we care to but the reality is we â€™ve reached a point where most people like to be given talking points and sound bites that their point of view rather than actually try to obtain facts and form their own opinions the truth is rarely in the bite size pieces our society today   trust in the media is at an all time low for no other reason than we allowed it to happen and rewarded the media for going down that path we â€™ve created a system that does not reward what we say we want from media rather rewards the actions that show we want the complete opposite    if i may inquire how many people reading this pay any premium for good journalism i will be the first to sadly admit i do not   obviously this means i am also part of the problem despite making an effort to look at news from all sides i am just a guilty as most to reinforcing the same system that has destroyed journalistic integrity

3 5 years is long enough of a timeframe that i 'd certainly invest it assuming you have enough which $ 10k is   even conservatively you can guess at 4 5 annual growth if you invest reasonably conservatively 60/40 mix of stocks bonds with both in large etfs or similar you should have a good chance to gain along those lines and still be reasonably safe in case the market tanks    of course the market could tank at any time and wipe out 20 30 of that or even more even if you invest conservatively so you need to think about that risk and decide if it 's worth it or not   but particularly if your 3 5 year time frame is reasonably flexible i.e. if in 2019 the market tanks you can wait the 2 3 years it may take to come back up you should be investing and as usual the normal warnings apply   past performance is not a guarantee of future performance we are not your investment advisors and you may lose 100 of your investment

it is a bit of work and expense to form a llc in the long run it is the best approach because it shields your personal assets from business liability in the short run you can form as a sole proprietor and operate that way and later convert to a llc

venezuela is an interesting example because one of the main drivers behind the crisis was a decade 's long drought that caused the to fall below critical intake levels not only was their agricultural industry crippled by drought and not only were the city taps dry but on top of that they had to cut the work week short and ration electricity they could n't even use oil to generate electricity since they 'd moved away from it in order to increase exports in their case diversifying from oil and heavily investing into power actually made the crisis far worse   which is what is so scary about global warming what happens when lake goes dry

you can call cboe and tell them you want that series or a particular contract and this has nothing to do with flex tell them there is demand for it if they ask who you are dont say you are a retail investor the contracts will be in the option chain the next day i have done this plenty of times the cboe does not care and are only limited by occ and the sec but the cboe will trade and list anything if you can think of it and convince them that some people want to trade it or that it has benefits for hedging i 've gotten 50 cent strike prices on stocks under $ 5 i 've gotten additional leaps and far dated options traded i 've gotten entire large chains created i also have been with prop shops before so i could technically say i was a professional trader but since you are using ib and are paying for data feeds you can easily spin that too

not so much a scam if you fill the required paperwork and actually take time to mail it in assuming it 's done correctly you will get your money that being said having a mail in rebate program is usually a win win for the seller while they may have to pay a small fee to a third party who handles the rebate almost always this influences a potential buyer to choose a specific product over the alternative the seller knows very well that very few people will actually go through with it and yes they do often make the process needlessly complicated and long as a deterrent   plus let 's be real no one likes sending out physical letters anymore from a marketing standpoint the mail in rebate is a brilliant idea however it 's usually more of an annoyance for the consumer

from the 1st quarter 10q match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to in exchange for cash the issue debt supported by collections on the transferred advances we made these transfers under the terms of our advance facility agreements these transfers do not qualify for sale accounting because we retain control over the transferred assets as a result we account for these transfers as and classify the transferred advances on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as match funded advances and the related liabilities as match funded liabilities we use collections on the match funded advances pledged to the to repay principal and to pay interest and the expenses of the entity holders of the debt issued by this entity can look only to the assets of the entity itself for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against    i 'm not an expert in the accounting of these things but i 'll take a stab from the view of a bond investor   let 's assume the in question have been pooled together and sold into the bond market in the form of a mortgage backed security mbs     when a homeowner falls behind on their payment scheduled principal and interest their monthly mortgage payment amount or is advanced as if the borrower is still current to the person who holds the mbs   this is typically done from the time they first fall behind until either they 1 catch up on their payments or 2 are foreclosed upon and the home is sold to repay the mortgage balance   in either instance the advanced monthly payments are recaptured by the servicer before the holder of the mbs is paid   in this sense the servicer develops a sort of prepaid asset over time by advancing money they are almost certain to recover at a future date usually via foreclosure and liquidation     due to a high number of borrowers falling behind on their payments since the housing crisis and the resulting time it takes to foreclose on a property the etc have built a large balance of advances on the asset side of their balance sheet   to free up this cash prior to liquidation of the home they have sold short term bonds against this asset via an thereby creating the liability you reference   so in essence they have say a home they expect to be liquidated in twelve months that they have advanced on   the short term bonds sold via the offset this asset at an equivalent term thereby making the asset and liability match funded

it looks to me like this is a call an attorney situation which is always a good idea in situations like this family legal disputes   but some information first off if your family is going to take the car you certainly wo n't need to make payments on it any more at that point in my opinion   if the will goes through probate which is the only way they 'd really be able to take it the probate judge should either leave you with the car and the payments or neither presumably requiring the family to pay off the loan and settle your interest in the car   since the car has negative net value it seems unlikely that the probate judge would take the car away from you but who knows   either way if they do take the car away from you they 'll be doing you a service you have a $ 6,000 car that you owe $ 12,000 on   let them and walk away and buy another car for $ 6,000 second i 'm not sure they would be allowed to in any event   see the illinois dmv page on correcting titles in the case of a deceased owner illinois i believe is a joint tenancy state meaning that once one owner dies the other just gets the car and the loan though the loan documents would cover that   unless you had an explicit agreement with your grandfather anyway from that page joint ownership a title in the names of two or more persons is considered to be in joint tenancy upon the death of one of them the surviving joint becomes the owner(s of the vehicle by law third your grandfather can fix all of this fairly easily by mentioning the disposition of the car and loan in his will if he 's still mentally competent and wishes to do so   if he transfers his ownership of the car to you in the will it seems like that would be that though again it 's not clear that the ownership would n't just be yours anyway finally i am not a lawyer and i am not your lawyer so do not any of the text of this post as legal advice contact a lawyer

wealth is not distributed equally in any economy   and even if it were differentiation between people would lead to different interests being expressed in different ways as people either attempt to earn more to improve their situation or different people express those interests in different ways saving money to go on a holiday or to put a downpayment on a house people invite new products and services to be created to satisfy those demands in addition there is the problem of uncertainty   people save money today to cope with uncertainty tomorrow healthcare pensions education etc those savings do n't remain idle but are lent to others who believe that they can make a return through investing in new businesses or ideas the point being that any dynamic economy will experience change in the amount of goods available to the people within that economy from an economic perspective growth is just another   from a political perspective growth implies that people are getting wealthier   if that growth is distributed e.g. the poor do n't experience it and the middle classes do n't feel they get enough of it then that is a problem for politicians the emerging markets of the world are trying to raise millions of people out of poverty   growth is a way of measuring how quickly they are achieving that end growth in and of itself is meaningless   there are some people who believe that we as some proxy of society have enough stuff and growth is unnecessary but that implies that everyone is satisfied   for as long as some people wish to have more wealth stuff and have the means to achieve this there will be growth and for as long as there is uncertainty growth will vary

diversification is just one aspect in an investment portfolio the other aspects in investment are risk taking ability liquidity local regulations tax benefits ease convenience cost of carrying out transactions etc investing in other regions is prone fx risk and other risks depending on the region of investment for example investing in emerging markets there is a risk of local regulations being changed additional tax being levied or political instability and host of such risks   investing in local markets give you better understanding of such changes and the risk associated is less plus the ease of carrying out transactions is great less expensive compared to cost of transactions in other markets diversification in investment should also be looked upon how much you invest in equities debt bullion real estate    once you have a sizeable amount of investment in equities or debt it would then make more sense to diversify this portion more to include funds from other regions unless you are an running your own business it makes sense to invest in your line of business if that is performing well the reason being that the benefit returns from the equities is much greater than the salary rise bonus for example i am in information technology and yet invest in all leading it companies because the returns from companies in these segments have been good

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

depends on how far down the market is heading how certain you are that it is going that way when you think it will fall and how risk averse you are   by better i will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital if you are very certain the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put   if you can borrow some money to buy even more puts you will make even more   use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today 's prices   but remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor   a short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage   the of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required   futures trade in large denominations so think about how much you are able to put to risk the inverse etfs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above   the levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward   you can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower directly short selling an etf or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky   on par with the inverse etfs

if i have a asset a with expected return of 100 and by standard deviation 1 and asset b with expected return of 1 and risk 100 would it be rational to put asset b into the portfolio in the capital asset pricing model capm investors are rational and have access to perfect information asset a sounds like an excellent investment   b like a lousy one b is probably very far from the efficient frontier investors know this so a 's market capitalization will be high b 's low according to the capm you should then do the same rational thing everyone else is doing which is to buy a lot of a and very little of b each in proportion to its market capitalization of course the capm is just a model and like any model it is only as good as its assumptions however i think this particular application of the model gives a pretty reasonable common sense answer to the question

its important to note that aggression or better yet volatility does not necessarily offer higher returns   one can find funds that have a high beta measure of volatility and lower performance then stock funds with a lower beta    additionally to 's point better performance could be undone by higher fees    age is unimportant when deciding the acceptable volatility   its more important as to when the money is to be available   if there might be an immediate need or even less than a year then stick to a savings account   five years some volatility can be accepted if 10 years or more seek to maximize rate of return for example assume a person is near retirement age   they are expected to have 50 k per year expenses   if they have 250 k wrapped up in cds and savings and another 250 k in some conservative investments they can and should be aggressive with any remaining money      on the contrary a person your age that is savings for a house intends to buy one in three years   savings for the down payment should be pretty darn conservative    something like 75 in savings accounts and maybe 25 in some conservative investments   as the time to buy approaches they can pull the money out of the conservative investments at a optimal time also you should not be investing without an emergency fund in place   get that done first then look to invest if your friend does not understand these basic concepts there is no point in paying for his advice

no chance cars are much easier to repossess and the cost of doing so is less people are n't quite as leveraged on autos as they were on homes even with a worst case scenario 7 year loan people are usually in par within 3 4 years in that timeframe on a 30 year mortgage you 've barely started paying the interest down even at the height of the housing crisis auto loan losses were manageable when people were losing their homes at a record pace you 'd think they would skip the car payments to make the mortgage that was n't the case people generally kept paying their car notes even when the house was going away losing your car is actually much more troublesome to most people they will make that payment over all others

there 's really not a simple yes no answer   it depends on whether you 're doing short term trading or long term investing   in the short term it 's not much different from sports betting and would be almost an exact match if the also got a percentage of the team 's ticket sales in the long term though your profit mostly comes from the growth of the company   as a company apple say or tesla increases sales of iphones or electric cars it either pays out some of the income as dividends or invests them in growing the company so it becomes more valuable   if you bought shares cheaply way back when you profit from this increase when you sell them   the person buying it does n't lose as s he buys at today 's market value in anticipation of continued growth   of course there 's a risk that the value will go down in the future instead of up of course there are also psychological factors say when people buy apple or tesla because they 're popular instead of at a rational valuation   or when people start panic selling as in the 08 crash   so then their loss is your gain assuming you did n't panic of course

according to hmrc 's manual you ca n't deduct expenses of this kind when calculating your profits for corporation tax no deduction is allowed for expenditure not incurred wholly and exclusively for trade purposes so at the least the company will have to pay corporation tax on this donation at some point assuming it ever makes any profits there 's also the risk that hmrc would say that what is really happening is that you are making a personal donation to this person and the company is giving you income to allow you to do it in that case you 'd be liable to income tax and employees national insurance and the company liable to employers national insurance it should then be deductible from corporation tax though

as documented in myfico there are several factors that affect credit scores payment history 35 the first thing any lender wants to know is whether you 've paid past    credit accounts on time this is one of the most important factors in    a fico Â® score as miller mentioned checking your credit report to determine whether or not late payments were reported to credit bureaus will give you a sense of whether or not this was effected you mentioned several bounced payments which certainly could have caused this this would be my largest concern with a closed account is to investigate why and what was reported to the bureaus and in turn other lenders also since this has the highest impact on credit scores 35 it 's arguably the most important this is further detailed here which details the public record and late payment effect on your score amounts owed 30 having credit accounts and owing money on them does not necessarily    mean you are a high risk borrower with a low fico Â® score however    when a high percentage of a person 's available credit is been used    this can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely to    make late or missed payments given that this card was closed whatever your credit limit was is now no longer added into your total credit limit however your utilization on that card is gone assuming it gets paid off depending on any other credit lines and since you reported heavy use that could be a positive impact though likely not length of credit history 15 in general a longer credit history will increase your fico Â® scores    however even people who have n't been using credit long may have high    fico scores depending on how the rest of the credit report looks depending how old your card was and particularly since this was your only credit card it will likely impact your average age of credit lines depending on other lines of credit loans etc you have open this accounts for about 15 of your score so not as large of an impact as the first two   credit mix in use 10 fico scores will consider your mix of credit cards retail accounts    installment loans finance company accounts and mortgage loans given that this was your only credit card your loan mix has been reduced possibly to none new credit 10 research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period    of time represents a greater risk especially for people who do n't    have a long credit history this focuses on credit inquiries which as you mentioned you will likely have another either re opening this credit card or opening another at some point in the future   regardless paying off the rest of that card is a priority as interest rates on average credit cards are over 13 and often higher source this rate comes into play when not paying the balance in full every month and also as miller suggested i would not utilize a credit card without being able to pay it in full it can often be a dangerous cycle of debt

the next phase   by       one mind boggling question is this good for the economy   20   september   2012   thursday ph    i want to share this to all the brilliant economists in this world    let 's talk on qe     by   m.   qe is not a cure it is a qe is synthetic no more no less qe is artificial it can not and will never hold water qe is only a temporary relief not an outright total solutions qe is absolutely not a guaranty not an assurance for recovery or growth qe is a very good tool this acts as an oxygen to a dying patients to breathe qe is now and forever taking away the oxygen the patient will going to die qe is a big balloon continues to expand amplify waiting to explode to burst qe will keep you moving today but not for the rest of your life qe is the more you move the more you get sucked down qe will bring joy today later it will bring tears pouring in your eyes that could not stop qe is worthless injecting precious blood highly precious dollar to a zombie economy a economy an absolute waste qe is brainless simply do not know what will going to be the consequences to the economy do not have the idea of what will going to be the final result qe is only a dream being over optimistic that one day everything will go back to normal that at the end of the day the economy will recover and finally would realize growth qe is just a fantasy meaning punching the moon the stars thinking it will resolve the year 2008 economic meltdown qe is an investment yes a massive investments to a dying economy absolutely wrong investments qe will keep you running it is like a ticking time bomb qe is not good for the economy the government acts or play as an investor instead of the businessman qe is being very kind and generous to businessman while keeping the country the state 's economy at stake or in jeopardy qe is putting more money to a business supporting the company to stay to exist for the time being and later on will literally closed shop qe is killing the mighty precious dollar slowly but surely qe is hide and seek like suze orman of cnbc say 's show me the money qe is treasure hunting ultra rich millionaires billionaires is keeping it they hide it where are those precious dollars making the economy sick crippled dead qe is a money making machine printing press once the economy becomes weak all they have to do is just print qe is putting plenty of money to a basket full of holes truly very few will benefit and so many will going to suffer   this is inequality   disparity is very disturbing counter to a good economy qe is experimental trial and error testing probability never done before qe is good at the start year 2008 after spending investing releasing trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars big companies millions of jobs were blessed saved rescued   and like magic america the wealthiest and most powerful country in the   universe is now going to act again today to spend invest release again and again and again and again trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars for the economy to keep moving my god what an abnormal cycle of the economy qe is a wild guess absolutely speculative before only big businesses huge companies are at stake   today it is now the whole country is at risk   not yet talking of the whole wide world with special mention to my my beloved country the philippines   this is certainly   absolutely domino effect   no one not one will ever be spared qe is very before only america needs to be saved to be today all countries is in distress suffering badly needs a rescue qe is keeping inflation very low yes absolutely for today but not for tomorrow   the medicine that they used during the 2008 economic slump is luckily still moving   meaning still working    but once this medicine starts to slowdown and begins to die down   you may call all the saints above   and the true inflation you are looking for searching for will surely and definitely come into your midst

obviously there are good answers about the alternatives to the stock market in the referenced question   hft has been debated heavily over the past couple of years and the flash crash of may 6 2010 has spurred regulators to rein in heavy automated trading hft takes advantage of churn and split second reactions to changing market trends news and rumors it is not wise for individual investors to fight the big boys in these games and you will likely lose money in day trading as a result hft 's 's may be right when they claim that it makes the market more liquid for you to get the listed price for a security but the article points out that their actions more closely resemble the currently illegal practice of front running than a negotiated trade where both parties feel that they 've received a fair value there are many factors including supply and demand which affect stock prices more than volume does while market makers are generating the majority of volume with their hft practices volume is merely the number of shares bought and sold in a day volume shows how many shares people are interested in trading not the actual underlying value of the security and its long term prospects extra volume does n't affect most long term investments so your long term investments are n't in any extra danger due to hft that said the stock market is a risky place   whether panicked people or poorly written programs are trading out of control most people are better off investing rather than merely trading long term investors do n't need to get the absolute lowest price or the highest sell they move into and out of positions based on overall value and long term prospects they 're diversified so bad apples like enron etc wo n't destroy their portfolio investors long term view allows them to ignore the effects of churn while working like the to win the race while the eventually gets swallowed by a bad bet there are a lot of worrying and stressful uncertainties in the global economy if it 's a question of wisdom focus on sound investments and work politically as a citizen and shareholder to fix problems you see in the system

i suppose that 's true and it would eventually level out   but again that 's pure speculation especially given the history of tsla et al   typically when we talk about market irrationality we are thinking of companies that do n't just simply have huge pe ratios but also companies with no history suggesting this will ever change   tsla is like that     sure there are plenty of companies out there that have giant pe ratios but they also have a history of delivering on promises and growing profits   tsla does n't have that history so it makes you wonder why people believe anything will ever be different for the   it 's really just pure speculation   especially with how tsla constantly under delivers on forecasts     nothing wrong with losing money as a start up or even as a more mature company exploring new horizons but tsla goes beyond that as just a of an investment   they heavily utilize gov't subsidies and continue to lose money meanwhile their ceo is in trying to build a create revolutionary batteries automate consumer and commercial vehicles stop ai explore nuclear fusion and a shitload more

the severity of wealth more so than its is what i 'm getting at when i talk about the fed the effect is a theory that essentially states that the first recipients of stimulus are far better off than those 2 or 3 degrees of separation later   so if you look at fed policies where monetary stimulus is directed only towards the financial system and credit markets certain parties will benefit disproportionately first before others later in this case that would be those employed by the industry bankers investors etc institutions in that industry banks hedge funds pension mutual funds and owners of securities the wealthy spillover effects impact the stock market real estate art etc and they are not a result of fundamentals but rather of mis allocated capital   what i 'm getting at is we do n't need central planners i.e. the fed to make decisions regarding the market for money interest rates or pursue dubious financial experiments at best to somehow fix problems that they themselves caused in the past through extended low interest rate environments central banking could take a very serious hit if cryptocurrencies become which i do not expect for a long but it 's the best emergent to the existing paradigm

once wealth accumulates in the hands of a few they 're less likely to spend it as opposed to when there 's smaller amounts of wealth in the hands of many that 's one of the primary arguments for more economic equality   you then also have the case of that wealth being used to generate more wealth without really adding anything of value employing hedge fund managers bankers lawyers and accountants to manage large amounts of that wealth in order to use it to generate more wealth sometimes in ways that does n't benefit society at all and sometimes even to its detriment toxic assets tax evasion etc    overall this has the effect of weakening the economy at the very least inhibiting its growth and i do n't possibly see how you could argue that a weaker economy benefits anyone especially those in the best position to take advantage of the goods produced by a stronger economy the wealthy a stronger economy means more and better goods on the market that the rich can then benefit from i do n't think the luxury goods market would go anywhere either and may even allow it to grow because of the people who are just under the wealthiest would get richer with more equality remember it 's only the top 10 who benefit from the current massive inequality

did recognize the problem of democracy if a society like ours is facing massive inequality he thought that the majority the poor would vote in their own interest and take away from the minority the rich so he thought the solution is to decrease inequality and increase democracy   notice madison recognized the same problem in the american system but he came to the opposite conclusion he thought democracy should be reduced and power be left in the hands of the more capable set of men the wealthy elite   now the society you are describing would probably be self destructive if people went around having a mob mentality as you describe looting and committing violence this would be more like a death cult at some point you have to recognize that common people are usually the target of oppression not the cause of it ironically all the examples you mentioned were imposed by the powerful few on the not the other way around

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

i would strongly try to influence circumstances so that buying is feasible that means buy something where it is likely that you can resell it at the same price or even higher or at the least for significantly more than total cost of ownership rent payed elsewhere for example if it is in an area where you have good reasons to assume that prices will go up in the future or if the object needs and you are sure that you can do it yourself you will no doubt sell it later you will near certainly not live in such a small house for all time so the question of whether you will sell it is moot so when you have a potential house to buy you will have to calculate everything very carefully with an estimate of how long you will stay you need to make your calculation as optimistic pessimistic as you like this is more a question of your character whatever calculation comes out better wins it goes without saying that if you for example overestimating your ability or time to refurbish forgetting to calculate non obvious costs of being surprised by hidden damage to the object the price development in the area you run a considerable risk so the question of whether you are able to calculate the risks correctly will need to influence the calculation itself add 20 or whatever risk buffer if you are not sure etc but the potential is for you to have a very good start in the whole financial game of your life your house will likely be for a considerable time the biggest single part of costs in your life and getting that under control from the get go is a huge benefit

and specifically regarding prices of housing what factors drive prices in that regard i mean the houses are roughly the same but almost 3 times as expensive rent like so many things is tied to supply and demand on the demand side rent is tied to income people tend to buy as much house as they can afford given that mortgage interest is deductible and public schools financed through property tax performs better in valuable neighborhoods raise the minimum wage and economists expect rents to go up accordingly when employers and pensions offer cola adjustments it feeds into a price loop during the past ten years there was also some animal spirits irrational behavior present people feared that if they did n't buy now home prices would outpace their growth in income so even though it did n't make sense at the time they bought because it would make even less sense later if you assume prices only go up there 's also the whole california has nicer weather angle to explain why people move to sf or la on the supply side it 's all about housing stock in your old town you could find vacant lots or farmland in less than 5 minute 's drive from anywhere there 's far less room for growth in say the sf bay area or nyc there 's also building codes that restrict the growth in housing stock i 'm told co is one such place you would think that high prices would discourage people from moving or working there but between the university and the defense contractors they seem to have an iron grip on the market have you ever seen a cartoon where a character gets a huge bill at a restaurant and their eyes shoot out of their eye and they faint yeah that 's how i felt looking at some of the places around here remember restaurants have to cover the same rent problem you do and they have higher minimum wages and taxes etc moreover food has to be imported from miles away to feed the city likely even from out of state in california there 's also food regulations that in effect raise the prices if people are footing those higher bills i would n't be surprised if they 're racking up debt in the process and dodging the collectors calling about their lexus or taking out home equity loans to cover their lifestyle

this turned out be a lot longer than i expected   so here 's the overview despite the presence of asset allocation calculators and what not this is a subjective matter   only you know how much risk you are willing to take   you seem to be aware of one rule of thumb namely that with a longer investing horizon you can stand to take on more risk   however how much risk you should take is subject to your own risk aversion   honestly the best way to answer your questions is to educate yourself about the individual topics   there are just too many variables to provide neat concise answers to such a broad question   there are no easy ways around this   you should not blindly rely on the opinions of others but rather use your own judgment to asses their advice some of the links i provide in the main text s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns 10-year index fund returns the motley fool risk aversion disclaimer these are the opinions of an enthusiastic amateur   why should i invest 20 in domestic large cap and 10 in developing markets instead of 10 in domestic large cap and 20 in developing markets should i invest in reits why or why not   simply put developing markets are very risky   even if you have a long investment horizon you should pace yourself and not take on too much risk   how much is too much is ultimately subjective   specific to why 10 in developing vs 20 in large cap it is probably because 10 seems like a reasonable amount of your total portfolio to gamble   another way to look at this is to consider that 10 as gone because it is invested in very risky markets   so if you 're willing to take a 20 haircut then by all means do that   however realize that you may be throwing of your money out the window meanwhile reits can be quite risky as investing in the real estate market itself can be quite risky   one reason is that the assets are very much fixed in place and thus can not be liquidated in the same way as other assets   thus you are subject to the of a relatively small market   another issue is the large capital outlays required for most commercial building projects thus typically requiring quite a bit of credit and risk   another way to put it donald trump made his name in real estate but it was and still is a very ride   yet another way to put it you have to build it before they will come and there is no guarantee that they will like what you built what mutual funds or index funds should i investigate to implement these strategies   i would generally avoid actively managed mutual funds due to the expenses   they can seriously eat into the returns   there is a reason that the most mutual funds compare themselves to the average instead of something like the s&p 500   all of those costs involved in managing a mutual fund teams of people and trading costs tend to weigh down on them quite heavily   as the motley fool on years ago if you can not do better than the s&p 500 you should save yourself the headaches and simply invest in an s&p 500 index fund that said depending on your skill and luck picking stocks or even funds you may very well have been able to beat the s&p 500 over the past 10 years   of course you may have also done a whole lot worse   this article discusses the performance of the s&p 500 over the past 60 years   as you can see the past 10 years have been a very ride yielding in a negative return   again keep in mind that you could have done much worse with other investments that site simple stock investing may be a good place to start educating yourself   i am not familiar with the site so do not take this as an endorsement   a quick once over of the material on the site leads me to believe that it may provide a good bit of information in readily digestible forms   the motley fool was a favorite site of mine in the past for the individual investor   however they seem to have turned to the dark side charging for much of their advice   that said it may still be a good place to get started   you may also decide that it is worth paying for their advice this blog post though dated compares some vanguard index funds and is a light introduction into the contrarian view of investing   simply put this view holds that one should not be a following the crowd rather one should do the opposite of what everyone else is doing   one strong argument in favor of this view is the fact that as more people pile onto an investing strategy or into a particular market the yields thin out and the risk of a correction i.e. a downturn increases    in the worst case this leads to a bubble which corrects itself suddenly or pops thus the term bubble leading to quite a bit of pain for the participants   an participant is one who is not hedged properly   basically this means they were not invested in other markets strategies that would increase in yield as a result of the event that caused the bubble to pop    note that the recent housing bubble and resulting credit crunch beat quite heavily on the both the stock and bond markets   so the easy hedge for stocks being bonds did not necessarily work out so well   this makes sense as the housing bubble burst due to concerns over easy credit unfortunately i do n't have any good resources on hand that may provide starting points or discuss the various investing strategies   i must admit that i am turning my interests back to investing after a    as i stated i used to really like the motley fool but now i am somewhat suspicious of them   the main reason is the fact that as they were exploring alternatives to advertising driven revenue for their site they promised to always have free resources available for those unwilling to pay for their advice   a cursory review of their site does show a decent amount of general investing information so take these words with a grain of salt   another reason i am suspicious of them is the fact that they spammed me with lots of to pay for their advice which seemed just like the type of advice they spoke against anyway time to put the soapbox away   as i do that though i should explain the reason for this   simply put investing is a risky endeavor any way you slice it   you can never eliminate risk you can only hope to reduce it to an acceptable level   what is acceptable is subject to your situation and to the magnitude of your risk aversion   ultimately it is rather subjective and you should not blindly follow someone else 's opinion professional or otherwise   point being use your judgment to evaluate anything you read about investing    if it sounds too good to be true it probably is   if someone purports to have some strategy for guaranteed steady returns be very suspicious of it   read up on the madoff scandal   if someone is putting on a heavy sales pitch be weary   be especially suspicious of anyone asking you to pay for their advice before giving you any solid understanding of their strategy   sure many people want to get paid for their advice in some way in fact i am getting paid with reputation on this site   however if they take the sketchy approach of a slimy salesmen they are likely making more money from selling their strategy than they are from the advice itself   most likely if they were getting outsized returns from their strategy they would keep quiet about it and continue using it themselves   as stated before the more people pile onto a strategy the smaller the returns   the typical model for selling is to make money from the sale   when the item being sold is an intangible good your risk as a buyer increases you may wonder why i have written at length without much discussion of asset allocation   one reason is that i am still a relative and have a mostly high level understanding of the various strategies   while i feel confident enough in my understanding for my own purposes i do not necessarily feel confident creating an asset allocation strategy for someone else   the more important reason is that this is a subjective matter with a lot of variables to consider   if you want a quick and simple answer i am afraid you will be disappointed   the best approach is to educate yourself and make these decisions for yourself   hence my attempt to educate you as best as i can at this point in time personally i suggest you do what i did   start reading the wall street journal every day an acceptable substitute may be the business section of the new york times   at first you will be overwhelmed with information but in the long run it will pay off   another good piece of advice is to be patient and not rush into investing    if you are in a hurry to determine how you should invest in a 401(k or other such investment vehicle due to a desire to take advantage of an employer 's matching funds then i would place my money in an s&p 500 index fund   i would also explore placing some of that money into broad index funds from other regions of the globe   the reason for broad index funds is to provide some protection from the normal fluctuations and to reduce the risk of a sudden downturn causing you a lot pain while you determine the best approach for yourself   in this scenario think more about capital preservation and hedging against inflation then about beating the market

here 's an example that i 'm trying to figure out   etf firm has an agreement with gs for blocks of ibm they have agreed on daily vwap + 1 for execution price   further there is a commission schedule for 5 mils with gs   come month end etf firm has to do a monthly rebalance as such must buy 100,000 shares at ibm which goes for about $ 100   the commission for the trade is 100,000 5 mils = $ 500 in commission for that trade i assume all of this is covered in the expense ratio such that if vwap for the day was 100 then each share got executed to the etf at 101 1 + 5 mils per share = for a resultant cost basis   the etf then turns around and takes out let 's say 1 as the expense ratio $ per share   i think everything so far is pretty straight forward let me know if i missed something to this point   now this is what i 'm trying to get my head around etf firm has a revenue sharing agreement as well as other relations with gs one of which is 50 back on commissions as soft dollars on top of that gs has a program where if you do a set amount of vwap + trades you are eligible for their corporate well being programs and other sponsorship of etf 's interests including helping to pay for marketing rent computers etc    does that happen do these disclosures exist somewhere

there is a basic difference between saving for voluntary retirement i.e. choosing to do things other than work even though you could still work and the need to save for later in life in general regardless of how much you like your job a time will eventually come when you are no longer able to work and you will need an alternate source of income to live from at that point this is also the time when most people generally have the highest medical bills as well and may need other services such as long term nursing home care so even if you plan to work as long as possible a retirement fund is an excellent way to plan for these needs as it is tax advantaged and many companies offer matching contributions i would simply recommend that you see retirement accounts as a good way to accomplish your goals you do n't have to use them to create a typical retirement once you 've taken advantages of the match and tax subsidies you may also wish to consider saving for an annuity fees can be high so you will need to do your homework generally you want to wait and buy an immediate annuity but this is another way to turn savings into guaranteed income once you need to stop working best of luck

i think you are mistaken because they are consumer funded programs that ultimately get spent at entities that may or may not be corporations   a lot of hospital networks are non profit but are still seeing record inflows   these payments are not tax subsidies to stimulate a corporate activity the type of corporate welfare or direct funding from the us government per se   your argument is the equivalent of saying   food stamps are nothing but a corporate subsidy for grocery stores

adding to 's answer before you calculate your profits you can pay money tax free into a pension fund for the company director that is you then if you pay yourself dividends if you made lots of profit you do n't have to pay it all as dividends you can take some where the taxes are low and then pay more money in later years    what you must not do is just take the money the company may be yours but the money is n't it has to be paid as salary or dividend you can give the company director a loan but that loan has to be repaid especially if a limited company goes bankrupt the creditors would insist that loans from the company are repaid   after a bit more checking here 's the optimal approach perfectly legal expected and ethical   you pay yourself a salary of Â£ per month that 's the point where you get all the advantages of national insurance without having to pay above that you would have to pay employers ni contributions and 12 employee 's ni contributions so for Â£ 100 salary the company has to pay Â£ and you receive Â£ below Â£ you pay nothing   you deduct the salary from your revenue then you deduct all the deductible business costs be wise in what you try to deduct then you pay whatever you want into a pension fund well up to i think Â£ 25,000 per year   the rest is profit the company pays 19 corporation tax on profits then you pay yourself dividends any dividends until your income is Â£ 11,500 per year are tax free then the next Â£ 5,000 per year are tax free then any dividends until income + dividends = Â£ 45,000 per year is taxed at 7.5 it 's illegal to pay so much in dividends that the company ca n't pay its bills   above Â£ 45,000 you decide if you want your money now and pay more tax or wait and get it tax free every pound of dividend above Â£ 45,000 a year you pay tax but there is nobody forcing you to take the money you can wait until business is bad or you want a holiday or you retire so at that time you will stay below Â£ 45,000 per year and pay only 7.5 tax

the issue with your claim is that slavery is completely involuntary whereas i ca n't think of many cases in which one inherits debt or could come into it in any other way than signing up for it when a consumer takes on debt he she is consciously making a decision to owe somebody money the fact that they 'll likely have to work unless they win the lottery to pay that money back is not slavery it 's following through on a commitment if everyone was born with $ 100,000 an arbitrary amount it could be just $ 1 then i think you would have a better argument albeit still flawed

you could do a voluntary repossession while a repossession never looks good on your credit a voluntary repossession is slightly better a good friend of mine had a situation like this about 11 years ago   she was in an accident did n't have replacement coverage insurance and was left with a large chunk of debt on a wrecked vehicle that she then rolled into a new car in the end it came down to the simple fact that she could not afford a car loan on a vehicle that never was worth as much as she owed   since the car was worth less than the loan she really could n't sell it to fix the problem she called and arranged a voluntary repossession   she stopped making payments and parked the car till they came and picked it up   took about 4 months and 20 phone calls from her for them to come get it   in the mean time i purchased her a much older used but decent car for a couple thousand and she paid me back over the next year   the total she paid me back was less than the money she would have paid in the 4 months it took them to come get the car   in fact by the time they picked up the car she had paid back over half on the car i bought her yes the repossession did stay on her credit for seven years but during that time she was approved for a mortgage cellphone plans and credit cards etc   therefore i do n't know that it did that much damage to her credit when her car was sold at auction by the repo company it sold for much less than the loan amount technically she was on the hook for the remaining amount the outstanding balance on the loan was then sold several times to several different collection agencies over the years since then she has gotten letters every now and then demanding she pay the amount off she ignores these   most of these letters even included very favorable terms full forgiveness for 20 of the amount   at this point the statute time has run out on the debt so there is no recourse for anyone to collect from her the statute time limit varies from state to state   some states it is as long as 10 years in others it is as short as 3 years what this means is that counting from the date of the repossession of debt last payment or agreement to pay whichever is later if the statute period has elapsed and the lender collector has not filed a suit against you by the end of the period then they have effectively abandoned the debt and can not collect    find out what that period of time is in your state   if you can avoid the collection agencies till that period runs out you are scott free you just have to make sure that you do not ever send them any money or agree to pay them anything as this resets the calendar if you do not want to wait for the calendar to run out if you wait long enough you will probably be offered favorable terms to pay only a fraction of the remaining amount you just have to wait it out note i normally would not endorse anyone not paying off their debts   however sometimes it is necessary and it is for this type of situation that we have things like this and bankruptcy

what prevents a company from doing secondary public stock offerings on regular basis the primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds that can be utilized for funding the business if no funding is needed i.e. company has sufficient funds or no expansion plans this funding creates a drag and existing shareholder including promoters loose value for example with the current 100 invested the company is able to generate say 125 25 as profit if additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering then with 200 the company should mark around 250 else it looses value so if the company took additional 100 and did not is not able to deploy in market on 200 they still make 25 as profit its bad there are other reasons i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc thus the reasons for company to do a secondary po are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders

real time equity or any other market data is not available for free anywhere in the us   it is always delayed by 10 15 minutes on the other hand online brokers who target the day trader interactive brokers td ameritrade etc offer much closer to real time data and feature all the tools alerts charts etc you could ever possibly dream of   i bet the type of alert you 're asking for is available with just a couple of clicks on one of these brokers platforms of course accounts with these online brokers are not free you must pay for these sophisticated tools and fast market access   another down side is that the data feeds sent to you by even the most sophisticated online broker are still delayed by tens of seconds compared to the data feeds used by big banks and professional investors   not to mention that the investment arm of the broker you use will be making its own trades based on the data feeds before them on to you so this begs the question why do you need real time information   are you trying to day trade i.e. profit from minute to minute fluctuations in the stock market   i ca n't in good conscience recommend that but best of luck to you   if on the other hand you do n't truly need real time data for your application then i support 's approach use public data feeds and write your own software   you probably will not find any free tools for the sort of alerting you 're looking for because most folks who want these types of alerts also need faster feeds and are therefore already using an online broker 's tools

well there are a few comments that need to be made here i suppose though at work now so this will be short    first there is the difference between banking which indeed mostly looks at capital adequacy ratios and uses var as one of the methods to get to the risk weighted assets then there is the buy side which is more interested in how much would i stand to lose in portfolio x if markets head south and how does that relate to what a have promised my client in the first situation it is the bank itself taking on the risk in the second the risk lies entirely with the client an asset manager could lose 100 on your regular old equity mandate and it would n't hit him except for loss in fees whereas a significant trading loss for a bank can put it out of business    my personal view is that all of these metrics are merely useful instruments and for a large part they all tell me the same thing a higher duration on a fixed income mandate will give a higher var a higher shortfall more negative results on rates stress scenarios etcetera they only really become useful when imposing limits on them or using them to steer based on whatever the prevailing risk appetite is at a certain point in time or when looking at trends or relative risk of portfolio a vs b   do n't get me wrong i too can debate for hours about var parameters confidence intervals look back periods return frequency decay factors parametric or historical monte carlo simulation etcetera but i think in practise that is really of limited use if you take any ex ante risk measure and you thoroughly understand it make an informed choice about risk appetite and steer on it you basically have done your job as a risk manager   sorry i know i am not answering your questions in a structured way but am on my phone so it 's hard to keep overview pm me if you want to discuss things in detail

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

by the phrasing of your question it seems that you are under the mistaken impression that countries are borrowing money from other countries in which case it would make sense to question how everyone can be a borrower with no one on the other side of the equation the short answer is that the debt is owed mostly to individuals and institutions that buy debt instruments for example you know those us savings bonds that parents are buying to save for their children 's education well a bond is just a way to loan money to the government in exchange for the original money plus some interest back later it is as simple as that i think because the debt and the deficit are usually discussed in the context of more complex macroeconomic concerns people often mistakenly assume that national debts are denominated in some shadow banking system that is hidden from the common person behind some red tape covered bureaucracy this is not the case here why did they get themselves into this much debt the same reason the average person does they are spending more than they bring in and are enabled by access to easy credit like many people they are also paying off one credit card using another one

i suggest that you use your own judgement on this you can assign a reasonable percentage since it is impossible to monitor the hours using those assets example 40 personal and 60 for business it 's really your call i also suggest that you should be conservative on valuing the assets record the assets at it 's lowest value this is one of the most difficult scenarios in making your own financial statements you can also use this approach i will record the assets at its original cost then use a higher depreciation rate or double declining method of depreciation if the assets have a depreciation rate of 20 per year useful life of 5 years i will make it 30 the other 10 will add more expense and helps you not to overstate your financial statement you can also use the residual value of the asset but if you do this you should figure out the reliable amount i understand that this is not for tax reporting purposes therefore there 's no harm if you overstate your financial statement and even if you overstate you can still adjust the cost of the asset along the way in the middle of the year or year end you will figure out the cost of the asset if it 's over valued once the financial statement is done

when you apply for the mortgage expect that the lender will want your sister to sign a form explaining that that is a gift otherwise the lender might be concerned that it is a loan be careful about the gifting of the money to a minor you could run into an issue if the money is n't spent on something that benefits the child the irs does get concerned about using money transfers between child and parent to get around tax issues other than that you do n't have a tax issue if the gifting is done correctly your sister can gift $ 14,000 to you and your spouse each year if your child has a large expenses in the near future tuition braces your sister could transfer funds to the child to pay for those items thus freeing up some of your funds for the house

part 1 quite a few or rather most countries allow usd account so there is no conversion    just to in india its allowed to have a usd account the funds can be transfered as usd and withdrawn as usd the interest is in usd there no conversion at any point in time typically the rates for cd on usd account was central bank regulated rate of 5 recently this was deregulated and some banks offer around 7 interest    why is the rate high on usd in india there is a trade deficit which means india gets less usd and has to pay more usd to buy stuff oil and other essential items the balance is typically borrowed say from imf or other countries etc allowing banks to offer high interest rate is one way to attract more usd into the country in short term because in time they may take back the usd out of india so why is n't everyone jumping and making usd in india the non residents who eventually plan to come back have invested in usd in india there is a risk of regulation changes ie if the central bank country comes up pressure for forex reserves they may make it to take back the usd ie they may impose charges taxes or force conversion on such accounts the kyc norms make it difficult for indian bank to attract us citizens except non resident indians certain countries would have explicit regulations to prevent other nationals from investing in such products as they may lead to volatility ie all of them suddenly pull out the funds there would be no insurance to foreign nationals    part 2 the fdic insurance is not the reason for lower rates most countires have similar insurance for bank deposits for account    the reason for lower rate is all the china etc park the excess funds in us treasuries because 1 it is safe 2 it is required for any international purchase 3 it is very liquid    now if the us fed started giving higher interest rates to bonds say 5 it essentially paying more to other countries so its keeping the interest rates low even at 1 there are enough people institutions who would keep the money with us treasury    so the us treasury has to make some revenue from the funds kept at it it lends at lower interest rates to bank who in turn lend it to borrowers both corporate and retail    now if they can borrow cheaply from fed why would they pay more to individual retail on cd they will pay less because the lending rates are low as well    part 3 check out the regulations

i 'd put the 20 down close on the house live in it for a year and save the difference   if you find your cash flow is fine run a calculation and start on a program of prepaying a bit of principal each month as an extra payment if you study how amortization works you 'll understand that an extra payment of about 1/6 the amount due will knock off a full payment at the end this is how a 30 year mortgage starts out meanwhile you should keep in mind it 's easy to prepay the mortgage but there 's really no getting it back so before letting go of your money i 'd do a few things i may be stating the obvious but consider no matter how low the payment on your mortgage a payment is due each and every month until it 's paid off you put 80 down take a 10 year mortgage you still have payments for 10 years you want to insure yourself against needing to sell in a hurry if you both lose your jobs so whatever you put down i 'd recommend a healthy emergency account 9 12 months worth of expenses

the interesting thing about an fsa is that you have access to your total annual election immediately   after electing to put $ 200 per month toward your fsa you can go have a $ 1,500 surgery on january 3rd and pay with your fsa funds   then you can leave the company on february 1st and not owe the company anything i understand that you do n't like that this is the answer but it is   the employer is on the hook for the full elected liability of an fsa plan as of the first day of the plan year   the employer is also paying admin costs that are n't passed to the employees   you contest that this arrangement could leave current employees picking up the bag for employees but there is no employee liability   fsa plans run at a net cost the the employer i 'm sure there are outlier exceptions however i disagree with your premise that   employees generally dislike that fsa plans are use it or lose it and also that there appears to be an obvious alternative that would be preferable the employees that dislike the rules of fsa accounts do n't fully understand the nuances and surely assume that fsa is a synonym for hsa   tons of employers offer their employees fsa plans and they are very well received   you can fill full prescriptions off of a debit card on the third day of the year before you 've even contributed anything hsas are great i have one but they require enrollment in a hdhp and you can only spend the funds currently available in your account   these are two huge limitations addressed by fsa plans   you can have a $ 0 deductible platinum plan with a $ 2,000 out of pocket max and an fsa debit card for virtually tax free healthcare   the caveat being if you do n't use your full fsa election you give it up in fact my biggest gripe with the fsa hsa discussion is that anyone feels the need to claim that hsa funds do n't expire at the end of a plan year as though it 's something other than a personal savings account   an fsa is a spending account or arrangement which is an entirely different animal   it would be like claiming that ira funds do n't expire as though they might somehow

first corporate profits can grow relative to gdp   if companies succeed in growing revenue without paying much more to workers then corporate profits and stock prices will grow relative to gdp   that has been happening for the last couple decades   if you require that we keep corporate profits vs gdp constant then borrowing leverage is how you do it   companies can expand their operations on a fixed amount of shareholder equity and as long as they can grow their profits faster than the cost of the debt then shareholders keep the upside   but this also means that share prices will quickly fall if profits decline even a small amount because the debt must still be paid off

first off you should contact your health plan administrator as soon as possible   different plans may interact differently with medicare any advice we could provide here would be tentative at best   some of the issues you may face a person with both medicare and a would potentially have primary coverage from 2 sources medicare and the no federal law addresses this situation under state insurance law an individual generally can not collect full benefits from each of 2 policies that together pay more than an insured event costs state law usually specifies how insurance companies will coordinate health benefits when a person has primary coverage from more than one source in that situation insurance companies determine which coverage is primary and which is secondary it â€™s important to understand that a is not structured to pay secondary benefits nor are the premiums calculated or adjusted for secondary payment in addition a person with medicare would no longer receive any premium assistance or subsidies under the federal law while previous federal law makes it illegal for insurance companies to knowingly sell coverage that duplicates medicare â€™s coverage when someone is entitled to or enrolled in medicare part a or part b there has been no guidance on the issue of someone who already has individual health insurance and then also in medicare we and other consumer organizations have asked state and federal officials for clarification on this complicated situation as such it likely is up to the plan how they choose to pay and i would n't expect them to pay much if they think they can avoid it   you may also want to talk to someone at your local medicare branch office they may know more about your state specifically or someone in your state 's department of health human services or whomever administers the exchanges if it 's not federal in your state secondly as far as enrolling for part b you should be aware that if she opts not to enroll in part b at this time if your wife later chooses to enroll before she turns 65 she will be required to pay a penalty of 10 per 12 month period she was not enrolled   this will revert to 0 when she turns 65 and is then eligible under normal rules but it will apply every year until then   if she 's enrolling during the normal general enrollment period jan march then if she fails to enroll then she 'll be required to pay that penalty if she later if this is a special enrollment period and extends beyond march she may have the choice of enrolling next year without penalty

i agree with the answers above would just like to make a couple of additional points it 's a good and simple strategy to try it out with a small amount as suggested by @joetaxpayer it 's also generally safe to assert that card issuers currently do n't receive or actively look at itemized transaction details but that does not mean they can not in the future some stores utilize level 3 data processing which tells the card issuers exactly what you bought in a transaction an example of level 3 data being utilized to reject rewards is with discover which announced a 10 cashback reward for any transactions made with apple pay last year it later introduced an additional term to exclude gift card purchases and this has been verified to be effective no more reward on gift card purchases of cashback on existing gift card transactions as far as i know amex does receive and look at some level 3 data that does not necessarily mean they will claw back your cashback after initially rewarding the 6 but it might show up if you ever trigger an account review and be used as evidence of your abuse of the program which btw is defined rather there has been many cases of account because of this card issuers are also trying to do a better job preventing abuses by proactively setting caps on rewards as opposed to closing those accounts afterwards and taking the rewards away altogether given the trend in recent years i have to speculate that at some point the card issuers would put clear language in the terms against gift card purchase and enforce it effectively if they have n't already this reward game is constantly changing it 's good while it lasts just be prepared and do n't get surprised when things go south

one key to trading is recognizing expectations   what you see in the market is not always a reflection of fundamentals sometimes it 's a reflection of what people expect to occur whether that actually happens or not is debatable when a currency experiences inflation such as the cpi being higher today for the usd it may see an increase because people expect that the central bank will raise rates   again this may not be the case and the traders with this expectation could be wrong   if you 're seeing a currency rise after reported inflation more than likely traders expect the inflation to benefit the currency in the longer run finally on the economics side and economists here can debate this at least in the past the view was that there was a relationship between inflation and unemployment see the phillip 's curve   this idea depending on who you ask was refuted in the 70s when we had both high inflation and high unemployment stagflation   supposedly if we have high unemployment we should have low inflation so we can always raise inflation to have low unemployment   note that you will still find some economists who think the phillip 's curve is true so refuted depends on who you ask from what i 've read austrian economists are the only economists who see inflation as always bad long story short i think it 's paul who argues that deflation is actually good like you 're seeing other economists might see it as a good sign and it 's only a concern when it 's very high hyperinflation

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

first off the jargon you are looking for is a hedge a hedge is an investment position intended to offset potential losses gains that may be incurred by a companion investment the other answers which point out that put options are frequently used as a hedge are correct however there are other hedging instruments used by financial professionals to mitigate risk   for example suppose you would really prefer that foo corporation not go bankrupt perhaps because they own you money because you 're a bondholder or perhaps because you own them because you 're a stockholder or maybe you have some other reason for wanting foo corp to do well to mitigate the risk of loss due to bankruptcy of foo corp you can buy a credit default swap a cds is essentially a bet that pays off if foo corp goes bankrupt just as insurance on your house is a bet that pays off if your house burns down    finally do n't ever forget that all insurance is not just a bet that the bad thing you 're insuring against is going to happen it is also a bet that the insurer is going to pay you if that happens   if the insurer goes bankrupt at the same time as the thing you are insuring goes bad you 're potentially in big trouble

your confusion is that that answerer is not comparing a $ 5500 roth ira contribution to a $ 5500 traditional ira contribution rather they were comparing a $ 3600 roth ira contribution to a $ 5000 traditional ira contribution it is fairer to do such a comparison because assuming that this person 's marginal tax rate is 28 both of them start with the same amount of pre tax money $ 5000 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 3600 of post tax money in 28 tax bracket as a result both a $ 5000 traditional ira contribution and a $ 3600 roth ira contribution will leave you with the same amount of cash in your bank account at the end after taxes are filed that 's why it 's a fair comparison and when you do such a comparison it will mathematically indeed always turn out to the same result for traditional and roth if the contribution and withdrawal are at the same tax rate on the other hand if you were to compare a $ 5000 roth ira contribution to a $ 5000 traditional ira contribution even though it 's the same nominal dollar figure you would be comparing apples and oranges because in one case it 's a post tax dollar amount and in the other case a pre tax dollar amount the roth ira contribution actually leaves you with less in your bank account at the end after taxes are filed than the same nominal dollar amount of traditional ira contribution so you are comparing an effectively larger roth ira contribution to a smaller traditional ira contribution of course the larger contribution gets more tax advantages over time and so the result looks better note that since traditional ira contribution and roth ira contributions share the same nominal dollar amount annual limit but we know that $ 1 of roth ira contributions is effectively larger than $ 1 of traditional ira contributions that means that roth ira contributions has an effectively higher annual limit than traditional ira contributions for example a $ 5500 traditional ira contribution is equivalent to a $ roth ira contribution for someone in the 28 bracket whereas a $ 5500 roth ira contribution would be equivalent to a $ traditional ira contribution which you ca n't do so it 's not possible to do a fair comparison when you go near the limit if it is important to you to tax advantage the largest amount of money then that is a reason to go for roth ira since it has an effectively higher annual limit you can not replicate the tax advantage of a $ 5500 roth ira contribution with a traditional ira contribution because that money in pre tax dollars is beyond the limit of a traditional ira contribution

currency exchange is rather the norm than the exception in international wire transfers so the fact that the amount needs to be exchanged should have no impact at all the processing time depends on the number of participating banks and their speeds typically between europe and the us one or two business days are the norm sending from other countries might involve more steps banks   which each takes a bit of time however anything beyond 5 business days is not normal consider if there are external delays how did you initiate the sending was it in person with an agent of the bank who might have put it on a stack and they type it in only a day later or worse or was it online so it is in the system right away on the receiver side how did you your friend check could there be a delay by waiting for an account statement finally and that is the most common reason were all the numbers names and codes absolutely correct even a small mismatch in name spelling might trigger the receiving bank to not allocate the money into the account either way if you contact the sender bank you will be able to make them follow up on it they must be able to trace where they money went and where it currently is if it is stuck they will be able to get it

question 1 how do i start or the broker problem get an online broker   you can do a wire transfer to fund the account from your bank question 2 what criticism do you have for my plan dividend investing is smart   the only problem is that everyone 's currently doing it   there is an demand for yield not just individual investors but investment firms and pension funds that need to generate income to fund retirements for their clients   as more investors purchase the shares of dividend paying securities the share price goes up   as the share price goes up the dividend yield goes down   same for bonds   for example if a stock pays $ 1 per year in dividends and you purchase the shares at $ then your yearly return not including share price fluctuations would be 1/20 = 5   but if you end up having to pay $ 30 per share then your yearly return would be or 3.3 yield   the more money you invest the bigger this difference becomes with $ 100 k invested you 'd make about $ 1.6 k more at 5   btw do n't put all your money in any small group of stocks you want to diversify   etfs work the same way where new investors buying the shares cause the custodian to purchase more shares of the underlying securities thus driving up the price up and yield down   instead of etfs i 'd have a look at something called closed end funds or cefs which also hold an underlying basket of securities but often trade at a discount to their net asset value unlike etfs   cefs usually have higher yields than their etf counterparts   i ca n't fully describe the ins and outs here in this space but you 'll definately want to do some research on them to better understand what you 're buying and how to successfully buy ie make sure you 're buying at a historically steep discount to nav and where to screen regardless of whether you decide to buy stocks bonds etfs cefs sell puts or some mix the best advice i can give is to a diversify personally with a single rare exception i never let any one holding account for more than 2 of my total portfolio value and b space out your purchases over time   b is important because we 've been in a low interest rate environment since about 2009 and when the risk free rate of return is very low investors purchase stocks and bonds which results in lower yields   as the risk free rate of return is expected to finally start slowly rising in 2017 and gradually over time there should be gradual downward pressure ie selling on the prices of dividend stocks and especially bonds meaning you 'll get better yields if you wait   then again we could hit a recession and the central banks actually lower rates which is why i say you want to space your purchases out

i concur with the answers above the difference is about the risk but in this particular case i find the interest level implausible 11 interest on deposits in usd seems very speculative and unsustainable you ca n't guarantee such return on investment unless you engage in drug trade or some other illegal activity or it is a ponzi scheme so i would suspect that the bank is having liquidity problems which bank is it by the way we had a similar case in bulgaria with one bank offering abnormal interest on deposits in eur and usd it went bust the small depositors were rescued by the local version of fdic but the large ones were destroyed

i would suggest you forget everything you learned in economics the only applicable knowledge is accounting 101   step 1 an accrual basis financial statement there is no step 2 if you do n't do this most small business do everything cash basis simpler cheaper but useless for analysis you would get better answers from the local fortune teller than a cash basis statement    make one change from the general rules if you have debt or are paying interest for inventory include that in your cost of sales this is actually proper but the rule is little known and often ignored interest on debt up to the amount of inventory is a cost of inventory   step 2 gross profit if you seem to be working hard and still losing money it may be because you are selling products for less than they cost you in this case the more you sell the more you lose so suggestions like advertising or doing anything to increase sales are actually destructive   step 3 price products at the level necessary to turn a profit at current sales and overhead when we have enough sales we will make a profit is the philosophy of a start up business it is toxic for a going concern   step 4 if sales are unsustainable at the price that produces a profit have the courage to sell or close the business i have seen people waste their lives on futile endeavors just because they ca n't make that tough decision   finally step 0 ignore all other suggestions but this they are well meaning but ill informed to reiterate growing sales while losing money on every transaction is a huge mistake trends books charts and graphs analytics and market research are the tools of con men and fortune tellers business is arithmetic and nothing more or less   fyi if i do n't get at least one upvote this is the last time i am giving my valuable professional advice away for free on reddit folks will have to rely on the suggestions of their fellow college kids

this depends on the involved us citizen resident giving gifts is required to pay a gift tax the recipient of the gift however pays nothing the value of the gift at the time of the gift giving is used to determine the tax and an exclusion of $ 14000 per person per year as of 2013 is available to allow smaller gifts to be given without too much of a red tape there 's also a lifetime exemption which is shared between the gift tax and the estate tax this exemption is $ 5.25 m in 2013   the reason the gift tax exists in the us is because the us tax code is very aggressive this is basically double taxation similarly to estate tax gifts estates are after tax money i.e. income tax has been paid on them yet the government taxes them again why the excuse is to disallow shifting of income if one person has high income tax brackets he may give some of his income producing property to another person with lesser brackets who would then pay less income taxes for example parents would transfer property to children similarly capital gains could be shifted generation skipping tax is yet another complication to disallow people use gifts to avoid estate taxes a grandparent would gift stuff to grandchildren thus skipping a level of estate taxes the parents in between in other countries the tax codes may be less aggressive and not tax gifts inheritance as this money has been taxed before this is a more fair situation imho yet it means that wealth moves from generation to generation without the general public benefiting from it so if you 're a us person and considering giving or receiving a gift you need to consult with a tax adviser about the consequences similarly with other countries if you are subject to their tax laws

so basically they are trying to see two things   one is whether prices are correlated to each other for long periods of time as a preliminary study suggested which would go against efficient markets hypothesis since you could use that info to game the market or if that result is illusory and the long term returns are close to a standard normal distribution which would follow the markets   the second thing i do n't follow as well but they 're trying to solve the first thing so that they can then look at why when they look at returns at different time scales one hour one week the model which had been proposed for these returns is not supported by the data   the first thing they say that the old model levy says that the variability should not be the same at the different time scales but the data suggests that it is   so they then propose a modification of the old levy model and say that it would also explain the strange first result they looked at that prices are correlated for longer periods   that probably does n't make any sense but you might have more luck by posting in /r statistics

considering the combined accounts you 're contributing $ 100 per month and they want $ 100 per year to administer them that 's of your contributions gone to fees each year   to me that 's a definite no   without getting in to bad the adviser for even making the suggestion the scale of your account does n't warrant a fee that high fees are very meaningful to the little fish investors   there are loads of ira account providers   with that level of competition there are several that have very reasonable account minimums no annual maintenance fees and a suite of no fee no load no commission low expense ratio funds to choose from   schwab fidelity and vanguard come to mind   i know schwab is running a big ad campaign right now as it 's reduced some of it 's already low expense ratios if i were you yes i would move the account because you can even get rid of the $ account fee   but no i would not move it to a higher fee situation in my opinion on a $ 3,600 account + $ 1,200 per year in contributions you do n't need advise   you need a good broad market low fee index fund and enough discipline to understand that retirement is 25 years away so you keep contributing even when news is bad and the market is going down   in 10 years maybe talk to an adviser using the s&p500 index daily close historical data from calendar year 2016 considering first of the month monthly deposits and a starting balance of $ 3,600 you would come out at the end of the year with about $   that 's $ in gain on your total contributions of $   they 'd take $ 100 that 's about 20 of your gain   compared to a no fee account with a reasonable expense ratio of 0.1 the fee would be just $   bearing in mind also that your $ 100 per year account will probably be invested in funds that also have an expense ratio fee structure further gains   further you lose the compounding effect of the $ 100 fee over time which adds up to a significant of retirement funds considering a 25 year period   if all you did was put that $ 100 fee in to a 1 savings account each year for 25 years you 'd end up with $ considering the average 7 return of the s&p you 'd have $ on just your $ 100 per year fees this is why you should be so vigilant about fees

i started looking at this yesterday after seeing a fb ad in reading the agreements it appears they are n't the fdic insured entity but rather they hold your money with an fdic bank who is their partner what i could n't tell is if they have one large account that they hold your money in commingled and i 'd suspect far exceeding the $ 250,000 fdic limit or if it 's individual accounts in your own name being held there and beam is the intermediary   what i 'm guessing is beam is actually owned by this partner bank and that bank is using this as a way to raise funds to fuel their loan growth in much higher rate areas such as commercial lending this is probably why they are capping the amount of new users so they can throttle the deposit influx until they 've lent it out the 2 rate paid to depositors is cheaper than going to the bond market

well all of the previous answers already mentioned the upcoming scam and danger situation for your financial position i thoroughly read all answers and wanted to add a few more lines on it already shows details of it any kind of financial transaction involving a complete stranger is the first big scam tag that shows up and this should always never fall in type situation if you open a new bank account or give away any existing bank account to this lady other than just losing some amount you might pay earlier than clearing checks you deposited on behalf of your stranger partner depending on their target plan experience with your bank account they can make you a victim of a bigger crime there is a full length of scam plans like sending you false checks to deposit and ask you withdrew money to send them back to even having very big incoming transaction to your account sitting idle on your account which might originate from a crime beyond the financial domain you can try to be smart thinking in mind well let them send some i will never send them back before bank declare the deposited checks got and clear and send back the amount after keeping your share but still you will face problems later even if your account fills up with real money and after confirming with bank you find it ok and never return them scam a scammer still you will not have any valid authority or answer describing how why you got this money if someone ask you later depending on scammer 's ability they might even give you control over fund to spend for your own to gain some trust from your part on this type of scam it is a sign of an even bigger danger i live such a country bangladesh from where recently they successfully transferred out around us$ 10 millions using a bank account of an outsider like you keeping in between source of money and final unknown destination the result is the owner operator of those accounts used for these transfers are now under law enforcement pressure not only just to find out where ultimately money has gone but for sure they will face some degree of charge for helping transfer of illegal money overseas for someone who is not part of a full scam chain it is a big deal it might ruin their life forever to be on the safe side and help protect others from falling on the same type of problem you may contact your local law enforcement agency depending on the situation they might be interested to run a sting operation using your information and support to catch and stop the crime going to happen soon or later i would give a rare chance of 2 legitimate reason for anyone to use a third party bank account to pay some other living either different country still it is not legal but a lower type crime but obviously they will not ask randomly over the internet social network sites in your case this is a real scam be careful and stay safe good luck

i am going to assume your location is the us from what i am seeing it is unlikely you will get a loan other than some government backed thing   you are a poor risk at 7k month you have above average household income   the fact that all of your income is being washed off somewhere is a behavior problem not a mathematical one   for example why do you have a car payment   you should purchase a car for cash failing that given reasonable rent 1100 reasonable car payment 400 insurances 300 other expenses 1000 you should clear at least 4000 per month in cash flow   where is that money going   here tracking spending and budgeting is your friend   figure out the leaks in your budget and fix them by cutting back and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months   that is not a very long time    similarly we can discuss the grocery store   had you prepared for this moment three years ago you could have bought the store for cash   this would have eliminated a bunch of risk and increase the likelihood of this venture 's success   if you had started this one year ago you could have gone in with a significant down payment   the bank would see this as a good risk if you wanted to borrow the remainder instead the bank sees you as a person as a poor risk   you spend every dime you make without much concern for the future or possible negative events by implication of your question   if you can not handle the cash flows of regular employment well how can you handle the cash flows of a grocery business   it is far more complex and there is far less room for error    so how do you get a loan   i would start with learning on how to manage your personal finance well prior to into the world of business

i tend to agree that the need for liquidity is overplayed in this day and age   we live in a world of electronic transfers that take only a couple days at most   with my brokerage account i can go from stock to gas in my tank via debit card in about 3 days we 're a long way away from the days when it took weeks phone calls and physical checks in the mail to go from stock to cash in your hand   we 've also moved a long way away from limited credit debit card acceptance   it was not long ago that my mechanic did n't accept credit cards   did n't carry a square reader on their iphone 10 years ago    however do n't expect debt to always be available   many many many people with strong income and stellar credit histories had their credit heloc limits slashed from 2008 2010 while banks back risk   a cash position of a size that makes sense gives you a high level of short term control you are n't reliant on someone else 's money liquidity is n't the main issue with emergency funds   the main issue is psychological   build a foundation rather than overly chasing yield

yes there are a lot of places you can research stocks online google finance yahoo finance reuters etc it 's important to understand that the price of the stock does n't actually mean anything   share price is just a function of the market capitalization divided by the number of shares outstanding   as an example take two companies that are both worth $ 1 million but company a has issued 10,000 shares and company b has issued 100,000 shares   company a has a share price of $ 100 while company b has a share price of just $ 10   comparing share price does nothing to indicate the relative value or health of company a versus company b.    i know there are supposed to be no product recommendations but the dictionary area of investopedia.com is a good source of beginner investing information   and as joe points out below the questions here with the stock tag would also be a good place to start   and while i 'm on a roll the book a random walk down wall street is a good starting point in investing in the stock market

one factor to consider is that some employers have a 401k contribution match policy that only allows a certain percentage of any given paycheck to be matched so if the company is willing to match 4 of each paycheck you could run into a problem here where you lose out on some of your company match for example suppose you get a $ 20,000 bonus you can contribute $ 18,000 per year to your 401k and this bonus could be a nice way to knock most of that out and then take home your full paycheck the rest of the year sounds pretty nice but there 's a problem the company will only match 4 of your $ 20,000 $ 800 when they otherwise would have matched up to 4 of your annual salary $ 4,000 if you 're making $ 100,000 in this example i 'd say it 's definitely worth it to make a big contribution to your 401k when you get a bonus as it 's an easy way to get a lot of money in there without really feeling a loss since it 's extra money on top of your normal paycheck but i 'd definitely be careful about this situation you do n't want to throw away free money to avoid this problem make sure that you leave enough of your annual limit so you can contribute enough to get your 4 company match on every paycheck of the year

unfortunately i believe there is not a good answer to this because it 's not a well posed problem   it sounds like you are looking for a theoretically sound criteria to decide whether to sell or hold   such a criteria would take the form of calculating the cost of continuing to hold a stock and comparing it to the transactions cost of replacing it in your portfolio however your criteria for stock selection does n't take this form   you appear to have some ad hoc rules defining whether you want the stock in your portfolio that provide no way to calculate a cost of having something in your portfolio you do n't want or failing to have something you do want   criteria for optimally rebalancing a portfolio ca n't really be more quantitative than the rules that define the portfolio

in studying the great successes in business it 's clear that those who do the best have unlimited creative and business ideas not just one idea but many ideas all day long everyday   no matter what you decide for your current idea document write down your process of each step that you took from idea to inception and track one or two key metrics alongside so your list would look like this   1 socialize idea goal revenue $ 0 total cost $ 0 time 26 hours 2 monitor money invested costs and hours of your time 3 what 's the quickest way to have one paying client 4 how will i track my customers 5 how will i connect and communicate with my customers 6 and on and on   from having an idea to implementation to even making money or a profit is quite simple straightforward and any book mentor or online free content can show you how   what is hard is maintaining motivation and creativity for when real challenges come up because they will    competition in in a way you that you and the sage commenters at reddit could n't have predicted you are audited by the irs and then owe way more in taxes than you expected from four years ago you are sued for a small claims or worse or you simply get bored or inspiration strikes in your heart on another great idea   problems like this require real and thoughtful creativity and implementation on demand all day everyday this is what starting a business is really about tracking your steps means that you can easily and quickly review what you 've done and or try another idea instead of in mistakes or hard problems it 's really much harder than it sounds but once you can invent more ideas to solve a problem than there are problems you can overcome most challenges   the framework is that you want to start a business because it serves your customers brings them enough value and delight to pay you and you have a way to make a living yourself and/or sell eventually or have some exit strategy   you want an exit strategy so that your business does n't become a poor paying job that you 're a slave to because it does and if it does a job is way easier and makes you more money   write down each step of your business building process track your costs revenue and time and have fun   then you have enough energy to pivot or change your ideas because you 've set up a repeatable process to run your next idea through with modifications along the way you keep your process for your ideas until your lifestyle is paid for your salary or something even greater monetarily

well first of all they clawed back 75 of those bonuses paid out so they really did n't get paid that money   second not every executive not even probably more than one executive was even aware this was happening there is one who might have known it was happening but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team the executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically   third those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options stock options glean their value from the price of the stock if the stock price goes down then their bonuses lose value or become worthless essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down so if the scandal had no affect on the stock price why would n't they get paid their bonuses the stock is the best indicator of the public 's reaction to the entirety of the bank

if you want to monitor how well you did in choosing your investments you will want to use stock prices that account for the dividends and splits and other changes not just the closing price   the adjusted close will include these changes where the straight close will not include them   using the adjusted close you will get your true percentage change   for example i have a stock called pets that paid an $ 0.18 dividend in july 2015 the adjusted closes before that day in july are all $ 0.18 lower per share   say the closing price had been unchanged at $ 20.00   the close prices would say i made no profit but the adjusted closing price would say i made $ 0.18 per share on this investment because the adjusted close would read $ in june 2015 but would read $ 20.00 in august 2015 just like the closing price   the adjusted close allows me to know my true profit per share

in fact it 's quite the opposite if someone is willing to sell some stock as low as $ 30/share and someone else is willing to pay $ one of those individuals is going to get a good deal unless hft acts as the middle man and the extra dollar in which case the individuals get the worst price they would accept and someone with fast computers gets to skim some profits while adding no value the order could have happened without the so called liquidity that hft claims to add   it 's not exactly that simple but that 's the basic effect it 's an unnecessary middleman that profits away from individuals on both sides   i would like to see a return to investing back to the meaning of the word instead of gambling on daily or short term fluctuations i would n't mind a long term holding requirement 3 months for every purchase and a daily exchange calculated set price calculated by actual orders placed that everyone who buys sells a particular stock on a given day pays   yes my ideas would destroy an entire industry i 'm ok with that because it would encourage people to really invest in companies

there is no right and wrong answer to this question what you and your business partner perceive as fair is the best way to split the ownership of the new venture   first regarding the two issues you have raised capital contributions the fact that you are contributing 90 of initial capital does not necessarily translate to 90 of equity in my opinion what is fair is that you transform your contributions into a loan for the company the securitization of your contribution into a loan will make it easier to calculate your fair contribution and also compensate you for your risk by choosing whatever combination of interest income and equity you see suitable for example you might decide to split the company in half and consider your contributions a loan with 20 50 or 200   annual interest   salary it is common that co founders of start ups forgo their wages at the start of the company i do not recommend that this forgone salary be compensated through equity because it is impossible to determine the suitable amount of equity to be paid i suggest the translation of forgone wages into loans or preferred stocks in similar fashion to capital contribution also consider the following in deciding the best way to allocate equity between both of you and your partner whose idea was it talk with you business partner how both of you value the inventor of the concept in general execution is more important but talking about how you both feel about it is good full time vs. part time a person who works full time at the new venture should have more equity than the partner who is only a part time helper control it is important to talk about control and decision making of the company you can separate the control and decision making of important decisions from ownership you can also check the following article about this topic at

as the other answer said the person who owns the lent stock does not benefit directly   they may benefit indirectly in that brokers can use the short lending profits to reduce their fees or in that they have the option to short other stocks at the same terms    follow up question what prevents the broker lending the shares for a very short time less than a day pocketing the interest and returning the lenders their shares without much change in share price because borrowing period was very short what prevents them from doing that many times a day lack of market    short selling for short periods of time is n't so common as to allow for many times a day   some day traders may do it occasionally but i do n't know that it would be a reliable business model to supply them   if there are enough people interested in shorting the stock they will probably want to hold onto it long enough for the anticipated movement to happen    there are transaction costs here   both fees for trading at all and the extra charges for short sale borrowing and interest   most stocks do not move down by large enough amounts many times a day   their fluctuations are smaller   if the stock does n't move enough to cover the transaction fees then that seller lost money overall   over time sellers like that will stop trading as they will lose all their money    all that said there are no legal blocks to loaning the stock out many times just practical ones   if a stock was varying wildly for some bizarre reason it could happen

does the full time phd student extend to 70 80 hours week or more if not can you pick up an extra job to aid with living expenses also whose name is the debt in is your wife paying to avoid the black mark on her credit record or her mother 's basically what it looks like to me is that you guys currently have a car you can not afford and that her mother does n't seem to be able to afford either at a ridiculous interest rate on top refinancing might be an option but at a payoff amount of 12k you 're upside down even when it comes to the kbb retail value i 'm somewhat allergic to financing a asset especially at a quick back of the envelope calculation suggests that she 's already paid them around $ 18k if you are indeed three years into the loan what i would be tempted to do in your situation is to attempt to negotiate a lower payoff to see if they 're willing to settle for less and give you clean title to the car worst thing they can say is no but you might be able to get the car for a little less than the $ 12k then preferably use your emergency money to pay off the car and put it up for sale use some of the money to buy her a cheaper car for say $ or less if you 're mechanically inclined and put the rest back into your emergency fund the problem i see with refinancing it would be that it looks like you 're underwater from a balance vs retail value perspective so you might have a problem finding someone to refinance it with you throwing some of your emergency money at it in the first place

you will make a profit in nominal dollars or nominal units of whatever currency you used to buy the token   whether you 'll make a profit in real dollars depends on inflation and in practice whether it would be possible to sell your existing tokens to someone else for the new price suppose when the price was 50 u 50 units since you did n't specify a currency you bought one token   today you can either spend 52 u for a token and get a liter of milk or you can spend your existing token for which you paid 50 u and get a liter of milk   it looks like you are making a profit of 2 u by spending your token however whether that profit is real or illusory depends on what else you could do with the token   for instance suppose that since the price of a token is now 52 u you will have no trouble finding someone who wants to buy your token from you for 52 u.   if you sell your token for 52 u you 'll still only be able to buy 1 l of milk   so if you measure your wealth in milk you have made no profit in the past you had a token representing 1 l of milk and today you still have a token representing 1 l of milk suppose now that in the past when a token cost 50 u a hamburger also cost 50 u.   suppose further that a hamburger now costs 52 u.   so you can sell your token for 52 u but that 52 u will still only buy you one hamburger   so again if you measure your wealth in hamburgers your have made no profit   in the past you could have sold your token and bought a hamburger today you can still sell your token and buy a hamburger and you 'll have nothing left over so you have gained nothing if on the other hand the price of a hamburger today is still 50 u then you call sell your token for 52 u buy a hamburger for 50 u and still have 2 u left over   you have made a profit what this all goes to show is that in practice the idea of profit depends on the overall economy and whether you could exchange the currency units you have in your possession for a greater quantity of goods than you could in the past   whether this is possible depends on the relative changes in price of various goods   in other words if you get your money by selling product a and later you buy product b you may or may not make a profit depending on how the prices of the two products moved relative to one another also in your hypothetical setup the currency the token is directly linked to the value of a single good so you can always at least get 1 l of milk for your token   most real currency is not bound to specific goods like your milk token so it is possible for your currency to lose value in an absolute sense   for instance suppose you sell a book for $ 5   the $ 5 is not a book token and you can not rely on being able to exchange it for a book in the future in the future all books may cost $ 10 and the prices of all goods may rise similarly so your currency will actually be worth less no matter how you try to use it   this could happen with the milk token if the announces that 1 l of milk will cost 2 tokens your existing token suddenly loses half its value in sum it is easy to calculate whether you made a profit in currency units   what is harder is to calculate whether you made a profit in real terms often referred to as real dollars or inflation adjusted dollars or the equivalent in your favorite currency   the reason this is hard is because the idea of real dollars is fundamentally linked to the possibility of exchanging currency for goods and services and so it depends what goods you 're buying   inflation statistics published by governments and the like use a basket of goods to approximate the overall price movements in the economy as a whole

all things being equal a defined benefit pension is far better than an ira or a 401(k   think about it this way let 's say you can have a guaranteed $ 100 a month or the chance at $ 100 a month   which is better    now obviously your tolerance for risk is the difference but this is the beauty of a defined benefit plan your employer is picking up the risk   assuming that the pool of investments is about the same which unless if their funds are tremendously under performing they are the question is who takes the risk you or them especially if you are moving into a new position having a defined benefit plan is like having a risk free asset in your portfolio   it increases your safety   the only reason to roll this over into a 401(k or ira is if your expected value risk payout is better   a worked example if half the time you would earn more than $ 100 and half the time less then you could imagine the two as being equally good only if you really love risk would you take that chance   in reality only half the investments out there will beat the average and as such you actually have less than a 50/50 shot of beating a db unless if there are really low returns to it   more likely i suspect you are over estimating your ability to get a higher return

401(k can come in traditional and roth forms as can iras roth ira money is not locked away for 40 years only the earnings are locked away and earnings can also be withdrawn for special cases you might not be able to invest in an ira if your income is too high and if you do n't get a match for your 401(k that might not be the best option either the biggest advantage of the 401(k is the match if it exists if there 's no match the second biggest advantage is the tax deferral if you are in a low tax bracket that is n't as big of an advantage either i would say that there are plenty of reasons why you might not max out the 401(k for savings but it 's pretty easy to max out the roth ira if that makes more sense so there are n't a lot of reasons why not

when i left the uk four years ago free banking is still an option and i 'm pretty sure it still is   therefore you have chosen to have a bank account with a charge    in return for this charge you will be eligible to receive certain benefits   for example reduced borrowing costs discounted mortgage rates free overdraft on small amounts rewards for paying household bills by direct debit and things of this sort    amongst these benefits may be preferential savings rates   however from hmrc 's point of view it will be the extra perks you are paying for with your monthly charge   you have chosen to pay for the account and hmrc is not interested in how you choose to spend your money only in the money you earn while i agree with you that it does have an element of unfairness the problem is how would you divide the cost amongst the various benefits

i recently sold some property in which i structured the agreement with my realtor such that i would pay the normal 6 commission 3 to each agent if the buyer came from another agent if my selling agent found his own buyer he would get 4.5 commission as a seller it 's possible to negotiate such deals before the house goes on the market if you are selling another property you could similarly structure such a deal where your selling agent picks up the commission from buying the new place and agrees to reduce the commission on the place that you are selling leaving you in a better position than if you bought unrepresented as an unrepresented buyer you only have negotiating power insofar as the market allows the seller 's agent gains nothing from what you propose so unless they expect trouble moving the house waiting to see what other offers arise is certainly an option if they are having trouble moving the house then just reduce your offer and see what happens   when i pick a selling price the main factor is that i want to attract enough buyers that i can sell it quickly interest payments do add up selling a house involves more than just listing it for sale i have a good relationship with my agent and have done multiple deals with him i am willing to pay him because i believe it benefits me to do so i would n't risk that relationship just to close a deal with an unrepresented buyer that unrepresented buyer would allow for a reduced commission to 4.5 though in the contract i mentioned above

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

yes it can buy back the call but much before stock hits the $ 30 mark    let us say you got 1 $ from selling the call so the total money in your account is 4 $ + 1 $ = 5 $ when stock hits 10 $ your strike the maintenance margin is as soon as stock goes past 10 your maintenance margin is violated so broker will buy back your call at least ib does that it does not wait for a margin call now if the stock gapped up from 8 to yes broker will buy it back at 30 so your account will have a negative balance assume the call cost 20 $ when stock hit 30 your balance is 5 30 10 = -15 depending on broker i suppose they will ask you to bring your account balance back up to positive if they do n't do that they risk going out of business

we spent 8 hours with you criticizing my post and feelings on a topic   are you really going to get sand in your panties because you finally gave an opinion on something and it was easy to pick apart   you know that your opinion is based on a that has never successfully in over 10,000 years of human existence in any kind of size to be meaningful   we have literally of different forms of government that we can pick through and learn from and yet anarchy has n't made it through any timeframe in anything but statistically insignificant small and short lived societies   you had to reach back to medieval times just to find one single relevant example but yep   taxes and government are bad

as phil notes converting to roth means paying tax on the entire amount of the 401k or the entire amount moved anyway   most of the time that 's a bad idea   roth is a good idea when you 're young and paying lower taxes and often have lots of deductions and when your money will have lots of time to appreciate tax free i imagine there could be edge cases though where this could be a good idea   if he 's got a lot of savings which he 's planning to live off of for a few years not the income but the savings itself then he would have $ 0 income for those years   in that case it 's logical to convert some of the 401k to a roth ira to take advantage of lower tax rates probably up to or through the 15 tax rate depending on if his total dollars are enough that he 'll be paying an actual tax rate not marginal higher than 15 or not    now odds are it 's better to take that savings and invest it along with the 401k and then live off of those earnings rather than just spending the savings but i imagine there are some with circumstances where this would make sense particularly if for example he downsized in houses and has a few hundred k from that tax free

one possibility you may consider is to keep all of your funds in the stocks and shares isa while investing that proportion you wish to keep in cash into a tradeable money market etf a money market etf will give you rates comparable to interest rates on cash and at the same time it will give you instant access subject to normal 3 day settlement of equities    this is not exactly a perfect solution   most money market etfs will pay monthly dividends so depending on your timing you may have to give up some interest   in the worst case if you were to sell the day before going ex dividend then you would be giving up a months interest   in the best case   if you were to sell on the day of going ex dividend you would be giving up no interest

bankruptcy law is complex you need a lawyer who can advise you both on the statute and relevant case law for the district where you file your lawyer can advise you whether actions you contemplate are allowed   you can obtain advice prior to filing as you seek to determine whether the law and the relief it offers are suitable to your situation anyone considering filing bk should know that they will need to provide fairly extensive information you should learn about bk as you seek to understand whether that path is the best for your situation you should ask your lawyer specific questions about your situation and try to learn as much as you can you should read about the problems with taking out debt or making debt repayments to creditors especially family prior to filing bk these actions could impact your case and cause it to be dismissed and could even be considered criminal again you need a lawyer some things to learn about as you contemplate bankruptcy be aware that bk is federal law and you will be required to provide extensive information about your financial situation   you will be required to show up for the creditors meeting and testify that you have provided correct information   the trustee may will supply objections to which you and your lawyer will need to respond among other things you will supply you should seek legal advice about things that might become important even though you will have guidance from your lawyer you are the one seeking relief and you need to understand your own situation and the law

first off you should phone your broker and ask them just to be 100 certain you will be exercised on the short option that was in the money it is irrelevant that your portfolio does not contain aapl stock you will simply be charged the amount it costs to purchase the shares that you owe i believe your broker would just take this money from your margin cash account they would not have let you put the position on if your account could not cover it i ca n't see how you having a long dated 2017 call matters you would still be long this call once assignment of the short call was settled

my wife and i do this we have one account for income and one for expenditures and around 7 others for dedicated savings doing this we are forcing ourselves to keep track of all expenditures as we have to manually transfer funds from one to the other we try to do this periodically every wednesday and then keep the expenditures within what is actually on the account it is a really good way to keep track of everything bear in mind that our bank provides a fast handy smartphone app where we both can check our account as well as transfer funds in less than 10 seconds authentication instant funds transfer as well as zero fees for transfers right now we have a credit card each attached to the expenditures account but earlier we only had a debit card each and no credit cards meaning that when the weekly funds ran out we where simply not able to pay we did this to mimic living only on cash and when the cash runs out you simply have to stop buying stuff and at the same time we could accrue quite a bit of savings i would definitely recommend this if you have problems with over expenditures

if you have a one time event you are allowed to make a single estimated payment for that quarter on form 1040-es   people seem to fear that if they make one such payment they will need to do it and that is not true   the irs instructions do kind of read that way but that 's because most people who make estimated payment do so because of some repeating circumstance like being self employed in addition you may qualify for one or more waivers on a potential underpayment penalty when you file your form 1040 even if you do n't make an estimated payment and you may reduce or eliminate any penalty by your income which is to say breaking it down by quarter rather than the full year   check on the instructions for form 2210 for more detail including schedule ai for income   this is some work but it might be worthwhile depending on your situation

the various levels of government have laws determining what a protected class is    federally wiki are the protected classes under federal law it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their membership of any   of those demographics on the state and local level many states have additional protections for example my home state of il explicitly forbids discrimination based on someone 's sexual orientation or gender identity classes which are not explicitly forbidden on the federal level   hate speech is protected under the first amendment so long as you 're not violence that caveat is very murky and i am not qualified enough to speak on what is and is n't violence from a legal perspective i just know that the caveat exists   the key distinction that i think a lot of people misunderstand and are confused about is that while hate speech is protected under the first amendment like all other forms of speech it is not a protected class meaning i can say whatever hateful rhetoric i want but non government entities are free to discriminate against me     i can absolutely be fired if my employer finds out i am posting on facebook advocating for the death of black lives matter activists or saying stuff like terrorist immigrant go home because political speech is not a protected class i can not be fired for posting a photo of my gay wedding in il because in il sexual orientation is a protected class    does that make sense

not in the long term of course not   but take a cross country flight in coach after the normal check in process at your destination stress over a lost bag or two and then with no turnaround time deliver an address run a meeting or work with sensitive materials   as others have pointed out an hour or two of coach is n't going to dramatically impact one 's ability to do that although the flight could very well leave a sour taste in one 's mouth if you had a baby screaming through most of it or some other adversity that could have been avoided if you flew business first

so many interesting points you raise    i only have a minute so   gt the more technology that is created the less privacy we have the dumber we become and the more jobs we lose to automation   i agree wholeheartedly with your first two points as far as the loss of jobs to automation i 'm not convinced that 's a bad thing    who exactly is happy spending 40 hours each week standing on a factory line or stocking shelves i do n't think that 's a life anyone would choose if better options were available    of course that raises the issue of better options being available    i think that the loss of jobs to automation will raise complex issues that are not nearly as black and white or predictable as many seem to think they are    p.s   you 're to chat with

the editorial highlights some reasonable consistent and transparent and then seemingly takes a left turn this concept or cutting out the middle man is a fantasy born of a time when local doctors provided affordable but limited care to a limited population it 's been a hollow talking point perpetuated by industry lobby in response to single payer proposals keeping health care between patient and doctor does n't address the key reasons why health insurance exists in the first place    the author suggests government funded escrow accounts for those who ca n't afford the cost of healthcare what about those just above the needs tested cutoff it seems that this approach and therefore punishes the middle class must those with chronic illness become indigent before the government will assist in their care the point of insurance is that when you get sick you are n't left spending your life savings on medical care level and transparent pricing does n't change the fact that certain treatments are still going to be expensive the auto insurance comparison always frustrates me because people are not cars if your car is breaking down every 30 miles you can take out a loan and get a new car a new body not so much furthermore every auto insurance claim raises your premium all of this amounts to a tax on sick people    single payer or even medicaid for all who want it means the government has enormous pool of patients or consumers if you wish with which to negotiate pricing do you really think st. xyz hospital is going to cut you an individual a deal for no reason where is the leverage particularly in the case of emergencies   it is n't perfect but and the tragic case of a brain dead infant does not strengthen your argument charlie 's case was not a matter of death panels it was a matter of parents in denial that their children was not going to get better it 's indeed an ethical and no doubt a tragedy but the of the situation was not dictated by a heartless government but by health care professionals    this is much more than i wished to say initially but i am tired of seeing simplified fantasy being sold as panacea for what is an extremely complicated subject also i 'm not a public policy scholar but i think i 've done a better job than the author

say one makes $ 60k yr the net gain is that half these funds are received about 2 weeks prior to keep the math simple let 's assume a 12 return per year on the funds during this time $ 30 k 12 is $ 3600 but 2 weeks is about 4 of a year so $ 144 that 's at a 12 return in an offset mortgage the return will be closer to 4 a $ benefit   with short term rates at or below 1 we 're really looking at a gain of $ 12 or so for the extra time with the funds

i do nt think we disagree i believe the notion of control is elusive in this day and age we have leverage or influence at best i agree that if the government is asked to invest or subsidize in another organization it has the right as should any investor to expect that its opinions will be heard and its interests will be protected in that context if any investor decides that its interests extend to amending management compensation i think that is reasonable
