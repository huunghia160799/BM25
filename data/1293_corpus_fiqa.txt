it depends on the size of the payroll not on the number of employees   probably you need to file form 941 quarterly under this scenario   you may or may not need to deposit taxes more frequently   if you must deposit then you need to do it electronically i this from the instructions for form 941 if your total taxes line 10 are less than $ 2,500 for    the current quarter or the preceding quarter and you    did not incur a $ 100,000 next day deposit obligation    during the current quarter you do not have to make a deposit to avoid a penalty you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely if you are not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $ 2,500 and your liability for the preceding quarter was not less than $ 2,500 make deposits using the or monthly rules so you wo n't be subject to failure to deposit penalties if your total taxes line 10 are $ 2,500 or more for the    current quarter and the preceding quarter   you must    make deposits according to your deposit schedule see    section 11 of pub 15 circular e for information and rules    about federal tax deposits i would say that probably for two employees you need to deposit by the 15th of each month for the prior month but you really need to check the limits above and the deposit schedule in pub 15 as referenced above based on your actual payroll size note that if you have a requirement to deposit that must be done either through or by wire transfer   the former is free but requires registration in advance of your first payment they mail you a pin that you need to log in and it requires that you get your payment in by the night before   the latter does not incur a charge from the irs but your bank will likely charge you a fee   you can do the wire transfer on the due date however so it 's handy if do n't get into in time this is all for federal   you may also need to deposit for your state and then you 'll need to check the state 's rules

to be fair i do n't necessarily think that our guy was actively trying to screw us over in retrospect i 've known a few people like him people with major control issues who get extremely anxious and when something is n't in their hands and who kind of develop this authoritarian mindset because they do n't trust the group as a whole that leads to a lot of paranoia and projection i think he kind of developed a sort of oh no i think he 's gon na kill me well i 'll kill him first mentality and that affected his thinking   every complaint he brought up privately with our president was something he was actually the one bringing to the table they think i 'm power hungry actually we did n't but thank god we found out that he actually was before it was too late they do n't trust me as the executive to make the decisions he seemed to be the strongest and guiding voice in the meetings but apparently was n't actually or expressing any of his actual plans because he did n't trust us to know them they 're gon na cut and run and we 'll be left to keep things together he set of a chain of events which led to us having to to get everything out of his name in order to keep our original timetable after this all went down it came to light how absurdly and specific his fears were down to my wife for being controlling or something because i wanted to discuss my portion of the buy in with her before i paid it when he 'd never even met her   anyway i 've had actual adult bosses like this and they invariably find ways of bringing people down over little personal disagreements regardless of how well they 're performing the paranoia and ego driving things for that personality type can be hard to see at first because they 're invariably charismatic and on message and capable of really looking like they 're taking the whole of the picture into account before making reasoned suggestions and you need somebody with these skills for top leadership positions i do have a measure of pity for these people as they seem to live in a state of really subtle but profound internal dissonance that nobody else really gets a look at   the main problem here is that it 's easy to conflate image with substance as you have to have a fair amount of knowledge about the topic being discussed to parse their behavior and especially once a large power structure around the guy the of can really build which makes it tough to distinguish between a well reasoned interpretation of reality and a specious one well our last meeting with the new structure was great and we 're more excited than ever about getting started with less baggage

a few years ago i had a 5 year car loan i wanted to prepay it after 2 years and i asked this question to the lender i expected a reduction in the interest attached to the car loan since it did n't go the full 5 years they basically told me i was crazy and the balance owed was the full amount of the 5 year car loan this sounds like you either got a bad car loan i.e. pay all the interest first before paying any principal a crooked lender or you were misunderstood   most consumer loans both car loans and mortgages reduce the amount of interest you pay not the percentage as you pay down principal the amount of interest of each payment is computed by multiplying the balance owed by the periodic interest rate e.g. if your loan is at 12 annual interest you 'll pay 1 of the remaining principal each month although that 's the most common loan structure there are others that are more complex and less friendly to the consumer typically those are used when credit is an issue and the lender wants to make sure they get as much interest up front as they can and can recover the principal through a repossession or foreclosure it sounds like you got a interest loan   with these loans the amount of interest you 'd pay if you paid through the life of the loan is computed and added to the principal to get a total loan balance you are required to pay back that entire amount regardless of whether you pay early or not you could still pay it early just to get that monkey off your back but you may not save any interest    you are not crazy to think that you should be able to save on interest though as that 's how normal loans work    next time you need to borrow money make sure you understand the terms of the loan and if you do n't ask someone else to help you or just save up cash and do n't borrow money

there are many questions and good answers here regarding investment choices the first decision you need to make is how involved do you intend to be in investment activity if you plan to be actively investing by yourself you should look for questions here about making investment choices if you intend to be a more passive investor look for posts by bogleheads who focus on broad focused low cost investments this is the optimal choice for many people if you are not comfortable managing investments at all you need to figure out how to find a competent and reasonably priced financial advisor to meet with and guide your investment strategy this advice generally costs about 1 2 of your total managed assets annually

generally when you own something you can give it as a collateral for a secured loan that 's how car loans work and that 's how mortgages work your equity in the asset is the current fair value of the asset minus all your obligations secured by it so if you own a property free and clear you have 100 of its fair market value as your equity when you mortgage your property banks will usually use some percentage loan to value to ensure they 're not giving you more than your equity now or in a foreseeable future depending on the type and length of the loan the ltv percentage varies between 65 and 95 before the market crash in 2008 you could even get more than 100 ltv but not anymore for investment the ltv will typically be lower than for primary residence and the rates higher i do n't want to confuse you with down payments and deposits as it does n't matter unless you 're in australia apparently so as an example assume you have an apartment you rent out which you own free and clear lets assume its current fmv is $ 100k. you go to a bank and mortgage the apartment for a loan get a loan secured by that apartment at 65 ltv typical for condos for investment you got yourself $ 65 k to buy another unit free and clear you now have 2 apartments with fmv $ 165 k your equity $ 100 k and your liability $ mortgaging the new unit at the same 65 ltv will yield you another $ 42 k loan you may buy a third unit with this money your equity remains constant when you take the loan and invest it in the new purchase but the fmv of your assets grows as does the liability secured by them but while the mortgage has fixed interest rate usually not always the assets appreciate at different rates now lets be optimistic and assume for the sake of simplicity of the example that in 2 years your $ 100 k condo is worth $ 200k. voila you can take another $ 65 k loan on it the cycle goes on that 's how your grandfather did it

maximizing income could mean a lot of things   what you really want is to maximize wealth   does n't matter if it comes from your bond appreciating in value or as dividends in order to maximize your wealth that 's today 's wealth you need to make decisions based on the net present value of these bonds the market is fairly priced especially for a tight market like government bonds   that means if your bond falls in price it has fallen by precisely the amount necessary so that an investor would be indifferent between purchasing it now at its current price and purchasing a new bond with a higher dividend   the bonds with higher dividends will simply have a higher price so more of the money comes as dividends than as price appreciation at maturity it will sell for face value   in other words the animals are out of the barn and you have lost or made money already   changing from one bond to another will not change your wealth one way or the other the only potential effect of changing bonds will be changing the risk of your portfolio   if you buy a bond that matures later or has a lower dividend than your current bond you will be adding additional interest rate risk to your portfolio   that risk should be compensated so you will have a higher expected return as well   but regardless of your choice you will not be made wealthier or less wealthy by changing from one bond to another should you buy bonds that will earn you the most possible   sure if you are below your risk tolerance   even among default free bonds the longer the maturity and the lower the dividend the greater the effect of future changes in interest rates on your bond   that makes them riskier but also makes them earn more money on average tl;dr in terms of your wealth which is what matters it does n't matter whether you hold your bond or buy a new one

gross income is used because there are a lot of variables inherent in the calculation of a net income including a lot of things under your direct control that you could use to game the system net income as others have inferred is a very flexible term for the average individual the definition that would most easily come to mind is likely post deduction post tax earnings take home pay it sounds reasonable too as the amount you take home each month can be easily demonstrated with your two most recent pay stubs which you need to bring in anyway to verify gross earnings however even that simplistic definition is fraught with possibility you have the ability to modify your pre tax deductions such as for retirement or healthcare and that in turn affects your taxes and thus your net take home pay to assume that you wo n't do that is foolish for the loan officer other definitions of net income such as in the case of shopping for a house disposable income plus current rent are the result of even longer lists of deductions from gross pay many are also dependent on your current home your electric bill is a function of the size location and construction of your current home all of which will change as soon as you move in your other bills such as telecom tv phone internet are also more or less location dependent as even within a single city or metro area your choice of services and service providers is dictated by the home 's physical location you may have to pay through the nose right now because your current home is n't serviced by anyone 's fiber optic network while the home you 're moving into could be in a hotly contested area with access to multiple fiber optic so to simplify all this mortgage companies simply ask for gross income then apply a metric that makes relatively conservative assumptions about your spending habits to arrive at a final amount the upside is simplicity the downside being that two people both making $ may have two completely different financial pictures behind that single number

my advice to you act like responsible adults and owe up to your financial commitments   when you bought your house and took out a loan from the bank you made an agreement to pay it back if you breach this agreement you deserve to have your credit score trashed   what do you think will happen to the $ 100k+ if you decide to stiff the bank the bank will make up for its loss by increasing the mortgage rates for others that are taking out loans so responsible borrowers get to subsidize those that their responsibilities if you were in a true hardship situation i would be inclined to take a different stance but as you 've indicated you are perfectly able to make the payments you just do n't feel like it real estate fluctuates in value just like any other asset if a stock i bought drops in value does the government come and bail me out of course not what i find most problematic about your plan is that not only do you wish to breach your agreement but you are also looking for ways to conceal your breach please think about this best of luck with your decision

there 's no reason for the employer not to deduct the whole amount before you leave the fsa salary deduction has to be periodical but it does n't have to be calculated over a year it just means that an equal amount will be deducted from your every paycheck and if the employer and you know that your last paycheck is on june 30th even before the year starts there 's nothing to stop the employer from calculating the periodic payments so that it will cover your full fsa amount before you leave that is of course other than mere convenience it may be easier cheaper to just give you the extra $ than to deal with the special case deduction calculation this is different from unexpected termination resignation where the employer could n't have made such an assumption and thus the periodic payments were calculated over a year see pub 969 the selection is annual the deductions are periodical

the vendor needs to do this using apportionment according to the vat rules for mixed supplies if you make mixed supplies and the individual supplies are not liable to vat    at the same rate then you need to work out the tax value of    each supply in order to calculate how much tax is due if the tax    value is based on the total price you charge see paragraph 7.3 you    do this by splitting that price between the supplies this is called    an apportionment there is no special method of apportionment however your calculations must be fair and you must be able to justify them it is usually best to use one of the methods shown in section 32 the section 32 referred to really relates to use between business and non business purposes but it implies that splitting up the total price in proportion to the original prices would probably be fair so in your example the vendor might split the £ 5 discount equally between the spoon and the as they had the same gross cost and pay vat as if each had cost £ 7.50 gross the vendor could also do it in proportion to their net pre vat prices and thus a bit more of the discount to the than the spoon but as this would lead to them paying slightly more tax overall they probably would n't choose to however none of this is likely to be too relevant to a consumer since in the uk prices must be presented as the gross vat inclusive amounts and so the discounts will also apply to those amounts it will of course affect how much of the purchase price the vendor ends up paying on to the government and thus might indirectly affect what discounts the vendor is willing to offer

this seems to be a very emotional thing for people and there are a lot of conflicting answers   i agree with joetaxpayer in general but i think it 's worth coming at it from a slightly different angle you are in canada and you do n't get to deduct anything for your mortgage interest like in the us so that simplifies things a bit   the next thing to consider is that in an amortized mortgage the later payments include increasingly more principal   this matters because the extra payments you make earlier in the loan have much more impact on reducing your interest than those made at the end of the loan why does that matter   let 's say for example your loan was for $ 100 k and you will end up getting $ 150 k for the sale after all the transaction costs   consider two scenarios if you do the math you 'll see that the total is the same in both scenarios   nominally $ 50 k of equity is worth the same as $ 50 k in the bank but wait you protest what about the interest on the loan   for sure you likely wo n't get on money in a bank account in this environment   but there 's a big difference between money in the bank and equity in your house you ca n't withdraw part of your equity   you either have to sell the house which takes time or you have to take out a loan against your equity which is likely going to be more expensive than your current loan this is the basic reasoning behind the advice to have a certain period of time covered   4 months is n't terrible but you could have more of a cushion   consider things like upcoming maintenance or improvements on the house   are you going to need a new roof before you move   new driveway or landscape improvements   having enough cash to make a down payment on your next home can be a huge advantage because you can make a non contingent offer which will often be accepted at a lower value than a contingent offer by putting this money into your home equity you essentially make it inaccessible and there 's an opportunity cost to that   you will also earn exact 0 on that equity   the only benefit you get is to reduce a loan which is charging you a tiny rate that you are unlikely to get again any time soon i would take that extra cash and build more cushion   i would also put as much money into any tax sheltered investments as you can   you should expect to earn more than on your long term investments   you really are n't in debt as far as the house goes as long as you are not underwater on the loan the net value of that asset is positive on your balance sheet   yes you need to keep making payments but a big account balance covers that   in fact if you hit on hard times and you 've put all your extra cash into equity you might ironically not being able to make your payments and lose the home one thing i just realized is that since you are in canada you probably do n't have a fixed rate on your mortgage   a variable rate loan does make the calculation different   if you are concerned that rates may spike significantly i think you still want to increase your cushion but whether you want to increase long term investments depends on your risk tolerance

the basic optimization rule on distributing windfalls toward debt is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first putting any extra money into that debt while making minimum payments to the other creditors if the 5k in other debt is credit card debt it is virtually certain to be the highest interest rate debt pay it off immediately do n't wait for the next statement once you are paying on credit cards there is no grace period and the sooner you pay it the less interest you will accrue second keep 10k for emergencies but pretend you do n't have it keep your spending as close as possible to what it is now check the interest rate on the auto loan v student loans if the auto loan is materially higher pay it off then pay the remaining 20k toward the student loans added this comment about credit with a view towards the op 's future something to consider for the longer term is getting your credit situation set up so that should you want to buy a new car or a home a few years down the road you will be paying the lowest possible interest you can jump start your credit by taking out one or two secured credit cards from one of the banks that will in a few years your account return your deposit and leave no trace you ever opened a secured account that 's the route i took with citi and wells fargo while over spending on credit cards can be tempting they are with a solid payment history the single most important positive attribute on a credit report and impact fico scores more than other type of credit or debt so make an absolute practice of only using them for things you would buy anyway and always always pay each monthly bill in full this one thing will make it far easier to find a good rental buy a car on the best terms or get a mortgage at good rates and remember credit is not equal to debt maximize the former and minimize the latter

there is one edge case that may be of value to you if you declare a bonus probably to yourself given a very small company you can deduct it from your year and then have up to 6 months to actually write the cheque and give it to the person say your year end for the corporation is july 31st you could declare the bonus july 30th and deduct it from that year lowering your corporate tax you could then wait until january 30th to actually write the bonus cheque the person would then have that taxable income in a later calendar year deferring paying the tax depending on the size of the bonus this would possibly matter although if you did large bonuses every year it would only matter the first time the other issue is the availability of your bookkeeper or accountant they are sometimes very busy during personal income tax season they often like a vacation immediately after that they may go away in the summer when their kids are out of school the nice thing about a july 31st year end is that you can probably count on a quick turnaround from your accountant in september the possible downside is that you wo n't enjoy reconciling your credit card statements and the like in august as part of getting your year end stuff together you can avoid that by keeping your books in a decent shape all the time

all of 's reasons to say no are extremely valid there are also two more first the cost of a mortgage is not the only cost of owning a house you have to pay taxes utilities repairs insurance those are almost always hundreds of dollars a month and an unlucky break like a leaking roof can land you with a bill for many thousands of dollars second owning a house is a long term thing if you find you have to sell in a year or two the cost of making the sale can be many thousands of dollars and wipe out all the savings you made from owning rather than renting i would suggest a different approach although it depends very much on your circumstances and does n't apply to everybody if there is someone you know who has money to spare and is concerned for your welfare your mention of a family that does n't want you to work for academic reason leads me to believe that might be the case see if they are prepared to buy a house and rent it to you i 've known families do that when their children became students this is n't necessarily charity if rents are high compared to house prices owning a house and renting it out can be very profitable and half the battle with renting a house is finding a tenant who will pay rent and not damage the house presumably you would qualify you could also find fellow students who you know to share the rent cost

you are presuming that after the transfer the cash is still sitting in a western union register but no that cash may have already been taken by the fraudster to refund the victim western union would have to 1 pay the victim back the amount of money lost and then 2 pursue the fraudster to reclaim the lost funds because the fraudster at the other end can simply show id to get the money ie they do not have an account with western union the cost to pursue that person to reclaim the lost funds would be substantially higher than for your bank because your bank can simply ding your account in the event that your account goes into overdraft because there were insufficient funds to reclaim the full amount the bank at least has a framework in place to pursue you for penalties

sounds to me like this restriction is limited to banks as issuers of convertible debt which may affect their compliance with capital requirements but is unlikely to affect the overall market for convertible debt   also the restriction is limited to retail investors and i think most convertible debt offerings are not aimed at retail investors so this restriction seems pretty limited to me

american express was originally a mail business that moved into money orders traditionally their cards have been charge cards instead of a credit card though they have credit products now as well they 've been marketed specifically as a premium product for people who have a significant amount of money and are willing to pay a significant fee for premium services such as amex 's good airline miles as such visa and mastercard are more widespread additionally the fees that visa and mastercard charge merchants are typically lower wikipedia says 2 as compared to amex 's 2.5 at least in the us so american express gets less business as a company but they charge higher fees to make up for it merchants will only accept the higher fees when they want to serve people who have a lot of money to spend or if they can negotiate a discount

the short answer is the money is yours from the insurance company they actually ca n't tell you how to spend it they can only decide from their tables and your plan how much you get the longer answer usually the insurance company pays one blanket amount then the rest where you have to submit receipts   you 're also lucky because damage over time is rarely covered damage is usually only covered as sudden damage so they do n't pay out for maintenance issues you can repair your house the way you want i even do some of my own labor because some repair jobs just do n't get covered what they really cost to do right    however your mortgage company can withhold part of your claim to verify satisfactory work this is to maintain the value of the collateral and the insurance company can choose not to cover pre existing damage   generally they do n't stray from the assessment    i do not know of any law that permits an internal inspection of your home without your consent   they can come look at the outside but they ca n't force you to let them inspect inside unless they 're holding some of your insurance payment hostage for most banks receipts are sufficient a good contractor usually will meet all the needs with an itemized budget and has a bit of wiggle room to fix things the right way while keeping the bank and mortgage company happy

a tax liability account is a common thing in my own books i track us based social insurance medicare and social security using such an account   at the time i pay an employee a tax liability is incurred increasing my tax liability account at the same time on the other end of the double entry i increase a tax expense account notably though the us irs does not necessarily require that the tax is paid at the time it is incurred   in my case i incur a liability twice a month but i only have to pay the taxes quarterly   so between the time of incurring and the time of remitting paying the amount is held in the tax liability account   at the time that i remit payment to the irs the transaction will decrease both my checking account and also on the other end of the double entry my liability account to answer your question in short use an expense account for your other side account

so yes you may be having the inevitable where you realize that options can synthetically replicate the same risk profile of owning stock outright allowing you to manipulate risk and circumvent margin requirement differences amongst asset classes naked short puts are analogous to a covered call but may have different lesser margin requirements this allows you to increase your risk and the broker has to account for that the broker 's clientele might not understand all the risks associated with that much leverage and so may simply consider it risky for your protection

you need to find out if the credit card has been reporting these failed automated payments as late or missed payments to your credit report to do this go to annualcreditreport.com the official site to get your free credit reports and request your report from all three bureaus if you see late or missing payments reported for the months where you made a payment but then they did an automatic payment anyway you should call up the credit card company explain the situation and ask them to retract those negative reports if they refuse you should dispute the reports directly with the credit bureaus if they have been reporting late payments even though you have been making the payments that will impact your credit much more than the fact that they closed your account   unfortunately they can turn off your credit account for any reason they like and there is n't much you can do about that find yourself another job as soon as you can get back on your feet pay off your debt and think very carefully before you open another credit card in the future do n't start a new credit card unless you can ensure that you will pay it off in full every month

the new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot canadian housing real estate market the rules are a pre measure intended to avoid a bubble and later crash in real estate the government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates those rates currently at record lows are expected to go up later this year and into the future the tighter mortgage rules include borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5-year fixed rate mortgage even if they 'll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate   previously the 3-year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard the amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90 of the home value down from 95 of the home value   a home is not meant to be an atm machine anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property i.e. a property that wo n't be their principal residence will need a 20 downpayment instead of a 5 downpayment the new rules go into effect april 19th 2010   however according to the see below exceptions would be allowed after    april 19 where they are needed to    satisfy a binding purchase and sale    financing or refinancing agreement    entered into before april 19 2010 definitive information about the new rules can be found at the department of finance of canada   specifically refer to some additional news media sources

john 's answer is similar to what i was thinking you should invest in insurance because there 's an insurance salesman who needs to pay to send his kid to college i will never be a fan of any type of permanent insurance and i think it wrong to sell a single person with no dependents such a policy i 've used the expression variable annuities are sold not bought i feel the same about these insurance policies   the best advice i can offer in a short reply is this if you need life insurance buy term save as much as you can 10 minimum more if you are able a young person should be saving for retirement and to position them self to buy their first house if that 's what they wish what good is a full up whole life policy when you need to raise $ 40 k to put down on a house sorry to sound like i 'm this is one of my hot points

the definitive answer is it depends what are your goals first and foremost you need to have at least 3 months expenses in cash or equivalent i.e. an investment that you can withdraw from quickly and without penalty   the good news is that you do n't have to come up with it instantly   set a time frame one year for creating this safety net and pay towards that goal   this is the single most important piece of financial advice you will receive now determine what you need to do   for example you may need a car   compare interest rates on your student loan and the car loan   put your cash towards whichever is higher if you do n't need a car or other big ticket item then you may consider sticking your surplus into the student loans   50k at $ a month will be paid down in about 3 years which might be a bit long to live the lifestyle i 'd look at paying down the smallest loan first assuming relatively similar rates and freeing up that payment for yourself   so if you can pay off a month and free up $ 100 of that in six months then you can reward yourself with half that surplus and apply the other half to the next loan    this is different than some would suggest because you 're talking about entering severe spartan mode which is not sustainable    remember that life happens   you 'll meet someone   you 'll have an accident your brother will get sick and you 'll give him some money to help out   you 've got to be prepared for these events and for these reasons i do n't recommend living that close to the edge   remember you 're not in default and you do have the option of continuing to pay the minimum for a long time

many individual states counties and cities have their own income taxes payroll taxes sales taxes property taxes etc you will need to consult your state and local government websites for information about additional taxes that apply based on your locale wages salaries tips cash bonuses and other taxable employee pay strike benefits long term disability earnings from self employment earned income is subject to payroll taxes such as earned income is also subject to income taxes which are progressively higher depending on the amount earned minus tax credits exemptions and/or deductions depending on how you file there are 7 tax rates that get progressively larger as your income rises but only applies to the income in each bracket 10 for the first 2017 through 39.6 for any income above the full list of rates is in the above linked article about payroll taxes earned income is required for contributions to an ira you can not contribute more to an ira than you have earned in a given year interest ordinary dividends short term capital gains retirement income pensions distributions from tax deferred accounts social security unemployment benefits worker 's compensation alimony child support income earned while in prison non taxable military pay most rental income and s corp passthrough income ordinary income is taxed the same as earned income with the exception that social security taxes do not apply this is the pure taxable income referred to in the other linked question dividends paid by us corporations and qualified foreign corporations to stock holders that are held for a certain period of time before the dividend is paid are taxed at the long term capital gains rate explained below ordinary dividends like the interest earned in your bank account are included with ordinary income   stocks bonds real estate carried interest held for more than a year income from assets that increase in value while being held for over a year long term capital gains justified by the idea that they encourage people to hold stock and make long term investments rather than buying and then quickly reselling for a short term profit   the lower tax rates also reflect the fact that many of these assets are already taxed as they are appreciating in value real estate is usually taxed through local property taxes equity in us corporations realized by rising stock prices and dividends that are returned to stock holders reflect earnings from a corporation that are already taxed at the 35 corporate tax rate taxing capital gains as ordinary income would be a second tax on those same profits another problem with long term capital gains tax is that a big portion of the gains for assets held for multiple decades are not real gains inflation increases the price of assets held for longer periods but you are still taxed on the full gain even if it would be a loss when inflation is calculated capital gains are also taxed differently depending on your income level if you are in the 10 or 15 brackets then long term capital gains are assessed at 0 if you are in the 25 28 33 or 35 brackets they are assessed at 15 only those in the 39.6 bracket pay 20 capital assets sold at a profit held for less than a year income from buying and selling any assets such as real estate stock bonds etc that you hold for less than a year before selling after adding up all gains and losses during the year the net gain is taxed as ordinary income collectibles held for more than a year are not considered capital assets and are still taxed at ordinary income rates

the answer to your question is it depends   depending on the state you your friend and the llc are located in it can be very easy to run afoul of state banking laws or to somehow violate some other statute pertaining to the legal activities an llc may undertake by doing something like a loan it is not unusual or illegal for officers or employees of a business entity to be loaned money by the company they work for so something of this nature would n't be an issue with regulatory agencies   having your llc loan money to a friend who is n't an employee or officer of your llc just might not be kosher though the best advice i can give is that you should call the state banking commission or similar agency in your state and ask them whether what you want to do is alright   the last thing you want is to end up with auditors or regulators around your business even if you have n't done anything wrong and you certainly do n't want to run the risk of accidentally piercing the corporate veil as someone else here pointed out good luck

for a non etf mutual fund you can only buy shares of the mutual fund from the mutual fund itself at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day and can only shares back to the mutual fund again at a price that the mutual fund will reveal only at the end of the day there is no open market in the sense that you can not put in a bid to buy say 100 shares of vfinx at $ per share through a brokerage and if there is a seller willing to sell 100 shares of vfinx to you at $ then the sale is and you are now the proud owner of 100 shares of vfinx the only buyer or seller of vfinx is the mutual find itself and you tell it that you want to buy 100 shares of vfinx and please take the money out of my checking account if this order is entered before the markets close at 4 pm the mutual fund determines its share price as of the end of the day opens a new account for you and puts 100 shares of vfinx in it or adds 100 shares of vfinx to your already existing pile of shares and takes the purchase price out of your checking account via an ach transfer similarly for redeeming selling shares of vfinx that you own and these are held in an account at the mutual fund itself not by your brokerage you tell the mutual fund to that you wish to redeem 100 shares and please send the proceeds to my bank account and the mutual fund does this at the end of the day and the money appears in your bank account via ach transfer two or three days later   generally these transactions do not need to be for round lots of multiples of 100 shares for efficiency most mutual fund will gladly sell you fractional shares down to a of a share in contrast shares of an exchange traded fund etf are just like stock shares in that they can be bought and sold on the open market and your broker will charge you fees for buying and selling them selling fractional shares on the open market is generally not possible and trading in round lots is less expensive also trades occur at all times of the stock exchange day not just at the end of the day as with non etf funds and the price can fluctuate during the day too many non etf mutual funds have an etf equivalent voo is the symbol for vanguard 's s&p 500 index etf while vfinx is the non etf version of the same index fund   read more about the differences between etfs and mutual funds for example here

toyota has some of the cars around they are so ugly that it seems like their designers spare extra effort to see who can come up with the look they are reliable and less fun to drive   if i am in that segments i would rather go with a honda or a mazda equally reliable and lot more fun to drive specially the mazda

you should talk to a lawyer one solution i can think of is using a trust keep in mind that that may complicate things non trusts are taxed on income not distributed and trust means you effectively keep the of the stock if you do n't mind paying taxes on the dividends and keep the stocks in a living trust that would be imho the simplest solution that would however invoke the gift estate tax at the value of the stock when the ownership actually passes to the intended i.e. you die gift the stock to the child it would be very hard to pay the gift tax now and avoid getting the ssn and opening an account for the child with it

you seem to have not ever received a cease and letter and not sure if you know what you are talking about regarding the nature of this one   legal trouble is extremely disruptive to business and this is a tiny side project really not worth the hassle once they had proved the point being 90 certain you are in the right is not that reassuring if the downside is measured in 6 or 7 figures   issue was use of name and which are you ca n't just slap a famous persons name and image on your product or anyone 's for that matter without their permission trademarks do n't appear to come into it   they could have continued without use of his name and probably would be fine but by that point they have d what they set out to the profit is relatively small compared to the main business and they probably have some insight to how crucial the name was to the success e.g. what if 90 of web searches that lead to a sale included his name if ctr is much lower for non mcgregor ads etc

one thing you may want to consider if your budget is tight do your own escrow   you have to be disciplined but i do n't see that as a problem for you   nice job on no car payment or student loans the banks almost always screw up escrow and you can keep your monthly savings payment exactly what they need to be   dump in a savings account every month and you should be golden    here in orange county florida taxes are due in april you can get a discount of if you pay early   november is the first time you can pay it   when you run your own escrow as i do i can pay when i want at the end of november and maximize my discount   now your situation may differ but probably 110 not based upon research of escrow accounts are up

there are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home a sell it and take the profit in the case of a home you presumably still have to live somewhere so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it this does n't get you anywhere if you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location whatever you consider nice to be than this sounds like a winning option if it means moving to a less desirable home then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home you 'll have to decide if it 's worth it b use it as collateral for a loan in this case that means a second mortgage home equity loan or a home equity line of credit but this can be dangerous house prices are very volatile these days if the value of the house falls you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets in my humble opinion you should be very careful about doing this borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse 's life saving operation may be reasonable borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea the vacation will be over within a couple of weeks but you could be paying off the debt for decades

there are other answers here about how much you can deduct for a home office what seems unique is the question of whether you can deduct it for both your llc and for your employment unless your llc owns the home you can not deduct the depreciation directly instead you have to charge your llc rent for the time that you are using the space for the llc that rent must be declared as income on your personal tax return and you can then offset some of it with the time you spend in that space working for your employer and depreciation for time it is being rented to your llc using a strategy this complex may save you a few bucks on your return but this is definitely an area where a tax professional is worth the expense making sure you get it right

i think a big part of this is sports coverage like he brought up the only programming i miss from cable are live sports events luckily for me my favorite sport the nfl has kept games on non cable television for local markets even when their games are on cable otherwise i might actually buy it    what keeps tv in the game though are the contracts and blackout restrictions i 'm a big wisconsin sports fan i dropped cable in favor of picking up the mlb and nba online options the mlb one streamed game and looked great the hd was spectacular and the service good the nba was n't as great quality but definitely better than a free stream plus i could pick up to 8 teams i wanted to watch however because of blackout restrictions and tv contracts i could never watch a bucks or a game the sole reason i purchased the products was to watch my hometown teams but the tv contracts prevented it the nfl afaik only offers nfl replay you can watch any nfl game 24 hours after it has been played anyone looking for a change in these policies can look elsewhere too the nfl just signed a 10 year deal with television companies unless those channels want to start streaming the games on their websites it 's not going to happen unfortunately    i personally think the leagues are losing profit because they 're losing a large audience there are plenty of customers who stream games illegally online that would happily pay for a higher quality product but television is preventing this    also there has always been the excuse laid out by tv execs that we do n't know how to properly monetize this content on the internet that excuse worked 5 10 years ago i ca n't seem to buy it now anymore

put options are contracts to sell you pay me a fee for the right to put the stock or other underlying security in my hands if you want to that happens on a specific date the strike date and a specified price the strike price you can decide not to exercise that right but i must follow through and let you sell it to me if you want to put options can be used by the purchaser to cap losses for example you purchase a put option for ge from me on october 19th you can make me let you sell your ge stock to me for $ a share if the price for ge has fallen to $ that would be a good idea if its now at $ 15.00 a share you will probably keep the ge or sell it at the current market price call options are contracts to buy the same idea only in the other direction you pay me a fee for the right to call the stock away from me calls also have a strike date and strike price like a put you can choose not to exercises it you can choose to buy the stock from me on the strike date for the strike price but i have to let you buy it from me if you want to   for example you purchase a call option for ge 16.00 option from me on october 19th you can buy my ge stock from me for $ 16.00 a share if the current price is $ you should make me let you buy if from me for $ 16.00 if its less than $ 16.00 you could by it at the current market price for less commonly options are for a block of 100 shares of the underlying security note this is a general description options can be very complicated the fee you pay for the option and the transaction fees associated with the shares affects whether or not exercising is financially beneficial options can be very risky you can loose all your money as there is no innate value in the option only how it relates to the underlying security before your brokerage will let you trade there are disclosures you must read and affirm that you understand the risk

no you probably do not need to file a tax return if you received no income and if you meet a number of other criteria the below is copied and pasted slightly edited from the cra you must file a return for 2014 if any of the following situations    apply you have to pay tax for 2014 we sent you a request to file a return you and your spouse or common law partner elected to split pension    income for 2014 see lines 115 116 129 and 210 you received working income tax benefit advance payments in    2014 you disposed of capital property in 2014 for example if you sold    real estate or shares or you realized a taxable capital gain for    example if a mutual fund or trust attributed amounts to you or you    are reporting a capital gains reserve you claimed on your 2013    return you have to repay any of your old age security or employment insurance    benefits see line 235 you have not repaid all amounts withdrawn from your registered    retirement savings plan rrsp under the home plan or the    lifelong learning plan for more information go to home buyers plan    hbp or see guide lifelong learning plan llp or you have to    contribute to the canada pension plan cpp this can apply if for    2014 the total of your net self employment income and    employment income is more than $ 3,500 see line you are paying employment insurance premiums on self employment and    other eligible earnings see lines and 430 in general you will want to file a tax return even if none of the above applies you could for example claim a gst hst credit even with no income now if you receive any income at all you are going to have to pay taxes which means you are obligated to file a tax return if sufficient taxes were deducted from your paycheque you are still obligated to file a tax return however you will not have to pay penalties if you file late even if you file very late at least not until the cra sends you a request to file but be aware you wo n't likely be able to tell if you owe the cra money until you do your taxes and if you do end up owing there are substantial penalties for filing late in general i 'd strongly advise filing your tax return in almost all circumstances

whether to employ a payroll service to handle the taxes and possibly the payroll itself is a matter that depends on how savvy you are with respect to your own taxes and with using computers in general if you are comfortable using programs such as excel or quicken or turbotax or taxact etc then taking care of payroll taxes on a nanny 's wages all by yourself is not too hard   if you take a full of receipts and to your accountant each april to prepare your personal income tax returns and sign whatever the accountant puts in front of you as your tax return then you do need to hire a payroll service it will also cost you a bundle since there are no economies of scale to help you there is only one employee to be paid

in general it is unusual for a credit check to occur when you are terminating a contract since you are no longer requesting credit if the credit check was a hard pull it will stay on your credit report for 2 years but will only have an impact on your credit score for up to 12 months if the check is a soft pull it has no impact on your credit score since you 're past the 12 months boundary anyway i would n't worry about it   that being said please feel free to continue your investigation and report back if you can get comcast to admit they performed the 2nd credit check i 'm sure we 'd all be interested to hear their explanation for it

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

this definitely depends on your situation if   your furnace is relatively young it 's probably not going to require major service anytime soon so you may not need it as said if you can tolerate a couple of days with no heat you may not need it if you have access to trusted hvac you may not need it mind if i ask how much they 're charging there 's definitely a pain threshold that will vary based on your needs   for example i 'd be willing to pay up to $ 10 but that 's mostly because of the annual maintenance check if i had an older system or depended on it more my pain threshold would be higher my local gas company offers this service for around $ that 's not worth it to me because i 'm estimating i.e. guessing that any repairs i need to do in the next 5 years will cost less than 5 12 20 = $ 1200

i am using my debit card regularly in atm 's with a pin in stores with my signature and online but later you say   but from what i recall from starting my own business a long time ago for debit cards there 's only a per transaction fee of like $ 0.25 not a percentage cut only pin transactions have just a per transaction fee paid by you to the merchant and you are reimbursed by schwab   if you use your card with just a signature or online without a pin then it is a credit transaction from the merchant 's perspective   the merchant pays a fee and schwab gets its cut of that   so for two of the transaction types that you describe the merchant pays schwab indirectly out of your payment   only when you enter your pin does it process as a debit transaction where schwab pays the merchant    because check cards withdraw the money from your account immediately you do n't even get the twenty to fifty day grace period   so those merchant fees are pure profit for schwab offsetting the loss from the atm fees    you claim $ 4 5k in fees at $ .25 each   that 's sixteen to twenty thousand transactions   assuming that several is four to five years that 's more than ten transactions a day   that seems like a lot   i can see three for meals one for miscellaneous and maybe some shopping   but if i go shopping one day i do n't normally go again for a while   i have trouble seeing a consistent average of five or more transactions a day    even if we use just the higher atm fees e.g. $ 2 that 's still more than a transaction a day   that 's an extreme level of usage particularly for someone who also makes frequent purchases via card    i have n't done any other business with them i find this confusing   how does money get into your account   at some point you must have deposited money into the account   you ca n't debit from an account without a positive balance   so you must have done or be doing some kind of business with them   if nothing else they can invest the balance that you deposit   note that they make a profit off such investments   they share some of that profit with you in the form of interest but not that much really    of course schwab may still be losing money on your transactions   we ca n't really tell without more information on how much of each transaction type you do and how much of a balance you maintain   perhaps they are hoping that you will do other more profitable activities in the future    i doubt there are that many schwab customers like you describe yourself   as best i 've been able to see they advertise their banking services just to investment customers   so it 's unlikely that many customers who do n't use their investment services use their banking services just for atm reimbursements

the answer is stimulus but more specifically direct spending   the kind of stimulus where we simply fill in giant gaping holes of bank balance sheets is not stimulus at all and those who criticize keynesian economics because the bailouts failed do n't understand what they are saying   bailouts are not stimulus   creating middle class jobs that is stimulus     i will put it to you this way   almost every single company in existence uses some kind of debt to leverage its operations    almost every company that is listed on the stock exchange either sells bonds or issues commercial paper or both   this can also be a useful position for the government especially since their cost of borrowing is lower than that of any company     essentially the government can borrow at 1 put people to work and collect 25 in taxes   its cash flow positive in the short term and in the long term as well as long as it is effective and the economy gets better   a growing economy will bring in more than enough tax revenue to offset any costs of jump starting the economy     if instead you wanted austerity you would be calling for austerity on the largest economy in the world who 's bonds are still rated aaa and who 's borrowing costs are 1   if you are calling for austerity on that then nobody on earth is credit worthy   it is a non sensical position

just for clarification delta and probability of expiring in the money are not the same thing what the guy meant was that delta is usually a close enough approximation to the probability one way to think about it is to look at the probabilities and deltas of in the money out of the money and at the money options in these cases the delta and probabilities are about the same in fact if you look at an options chain with delta and probabilities you can see that they are all about the same in other words there is a linear relationship between delta and probability here are a couple links to other answers around the web hope this answer helps

there is another drawback and this is why i keep a low limit card for online purchases and another for carrying in risky unfamiliar situations e.g. travelling a small limit acts as as damage limitation in the event of theft in theory you may not be liable if your card is stolen and used   in practice you may be out of pocket for a considerable amount of time and trying to spend large sums on an card will soon trip it up especially if those large sums are out of the ordinary

the value of money is not only in the earning and saving of it but also in the discipline in spending it   any approach to teaching children about money must ensure a balance between the two otherwise they will either become fearful of spending and so never actually learn that money is but a tool and can be enjoyed or irresponsible spending with abandon with all that misery teaching kids about money is a wonderful opportunity to discipline and values   any strategy must be structured to suite the child 's age and abilities as well   trying to teach compound interest to too young a child will just become needlessly confusing and worrying for them   hope this gives a few ideas

in addition to the prior answer talking from experience you get into trouble if you surpass the contribution limit and your employer continues to deposit money above the irs maximum allowed when that happens you have until april to take out the excess contribution and earned interest on that chunk of money and included in your tax return or else you get a steep tax penalty in addition to being double taxed for the current and next tax year also from experience payroll departments will most likely get this wrong and it will end up in a compliance mess with you picking up the tab on your tax bill do n't let it happen

tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in ireland the rate of return would be lower in a place where you pay higher taxes as taxes are a cost the investment is going to happen sure it just depends on where that occurs    and then secondly the money that american businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy this is a problem because it means jobs for everyday americans going to another country where due to the other country is already more attractive in terms of labor costs due to our high price levels here in the us

is my math correct the math is correct however dividends do n't work this way the yield is post facto i.e. given the dividend that is declared every quarter once calculates the yield the dividends are not fixed or guaranteed these change from quarter to quarter or at times they are not given at all the yield is and the value is $ 114 per share assuming that the price remains exactly the same for an entire year and that i purchase only one share then this should be the math for calculating the yield 114 x = what the link is showing is that last dividend of mcd was for q3 that means total for a year will be 4 this means yield will be note this year there were only 3 dividend was on on and on it is unlikely that there will be one more dividend this year so for this year the correct post facto calculation would be + = and hence an yield of   also are there any fees deductions or would i receive the amount in full which should be $ 3.75 there are no fee deducted not sure about us tax treatment on dividends

first to clear up your misconceptions the balance is not merely made up of deductible and non deductible contributions   there are also earnings implied in the balance i.e. the whole reason you invest in the first place is to realize some return on investment   that return a.k.a the earnings are included in the balance of the account   the balance is the sum total of everything in the account the bottom line generally speaking basis for an account is all of the money that has been contributed deposited to the account   in the context of an ira as described in the article however they are using basis to refer to only the non deductible contributions   of note however is that basis specifically excludes earnings   if you have deposited say $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next then your basis is $ 10,000 even if the balance has grown to say $ 12,000 which includes the earnings as may be evident by now earnings are not equivalent to deductible contributions   earnings may arise from such contributions but they are not the same   rather earnings are the net positive investment results from all contributions   again if you had contributed $ 5000 one year and $ 5000 the next and the balance has grown to $ 12,000 then the earnings portion is $ 2000 so to interpret what happened in the specific example provided over the years the account holder contributed deposited a total of $ 15,000 into his account   these must have been non deductible contributions in the case of the ira in order to arrive at basis of $ 15,000 over time and with the deposits that $ 15,000 grew to $ 24,000 i.e. earned $ 9,000 in earnings then the nearly 50 drop caused the balance to decay to $ 13,000   this means all $ 9,000 of his earnings were wiped out plus $ 2000 of the original basis the remaining $ 13,000 is all basis that is considered to be original money deposited to the account no earnings in effect the account has lost $ 2000 of basis because $ 15,000 was deposited and only $ 13,000 remains   simplistic way of looking at it   a $ 15,000 investment resulted in a final $ 13,000 sale i.e. a net loss of $ 2000 it does n't matter that it hit $ 24,000 in the meanwhile it could have hit $ 250,000 in value and then dropped to $ 13,000 and the net result would be the same a loss of $ 2000 in basis traditional ira earnings are always tax deferred i.e. whether earnings arise from deductible or else non deductible contributions when one takes a distribution withdraws from an ira and the distribution includes earnings the earnings portion is always taxable income   does n't matter if the earnings arose from one kind of contribution or the other i do n't think in this example there were any deductible contributions whatsoever does that make sense help

this is a very vague question and could not be fairly answered without knowing additional details some examples would be   what is the total revenue of the non profit what are the total expenses of the non profit what is the effectiveness rate to the cause of each $ 1 donated   non profit organizations and charities have grown to large scale business operations that are focused on delivering value to their determined cause   the top 5 largest charities each had total revenues over $ 3.3 billion in 2012   this included united way goodwill the y and the salvation army with the largest being the y at over $ 6.2 billion in annual revenue   all of these non profits bring in enough revenue to be in the fortune 500 the company on the list is mining corp at $ 3.2 billion in revenue   when you consider the scale of these operations i think you need to acquire an experienced ceo that has a career history of leading large and many times multi national organization   these ceos command high salaries because of their talent and expertise   i believe when they are passionate about a cause they 're willing to take a discount but you have to understand the term discount proportionately   i made a quick table below just to provide some context and show reference points of several fortune 500 companies in comparison to the y the largest non profit in total revenue   you can quickly see that a salary of $ 450,000 for an organization of this size would be a significant discount in comparison to the ceo salaries of comparably sized organization in the for profit world   when considering charitable contributions it is entirely valid to consider the ceo 's salary but also consider the potential value add   for example if that ceo generates a significantly more effective ratio of utilizing donated $ then it may justify the salary    in some scenarios it is fair to say that $ 450,000 would be a fair and adequate salary for a ceo running a large scale non profit   is this the case for every non profit   probably not   it should often be thought of as a function of total revenue and effectiveness of the $ donated      company | 2013 revenue | 2013 ceo salary | ratio | $ | $ m | .15 corp | $ | $ m | northeast utilities | $ | $ 1.7 m | technologies | $ | $ m | .17 the y | $ | $ m |

your assertion that you will not be selling anything is at odds with the idea that you will be doing tax loss harvesting   tax loss harvesting always involves some selling you sell stocks that have fallen in price and lock in the capital losses which gives you a break on your taxes   if you absolutely prohibit your advisor from selling then you will not be able to do tax loss harvesting in that case why are you using an advisor at all tax loss harvesting has nothing to do with your horizon nor the active passive difference really as a practical matter a good tax loss harvesting plan involves mechanically selling losers and immediately putting the money in another stock with more or less similar risk so your portfolio does n't change much   in this way you get a stable portfolio that performs just like a static portfolio but gives you a tax benefit each year   the irs officially prohibits this practice via the wash sale rule that says you ca n't buy a substantially identical asset within a short period of time   however though two stocks have similar risk they are not generally substantially similar in a legal sense so the irs ca n't really beat you in court and they do n't try   basically you ca n't just buy the same stock again the is advertising that they will perform this service keeping your portfolio pretty much static in terms of risk in such a way that your tax benefit is maximized and you do n't run afoul of the irs

i think the short term that is true but if you really look at the two big platform iphone and android they are both very immature neither product has any real edge on the other   ms could potentially bring in a more mature platform since it 's based off their existing platform rather than a totally new os in doing that ms can also bring in a better development platform than android or apple have on their mobile devices    in think we 'll all realize apple and android effectively made a mistake by developing dumbed down operating systems for phones because phones are increasing in power so quickly the real need is where ms is going a unified platform    to me it seems a lot like their long term xbox strategy which allows them the option to unify gaming platforms also .net also fits right in perfectly since you have a very powerful and high portable development platform not just a single language or simple    so i think windows 8 phones stand a good chance in this market ms can bring all the advantages of android with a more standardize and well known interface biggest weakness is allow phone companies to tweak the interface horrible idea you want you os to feel familiar and comfy not different on every device    ms will also address apple 's big flaw the same one as ever which is being far too proprietary on top that ms has the money and connections to make it happen but similar to xbox they have to build up a use base before you are gong to see the product take off the first generation of these new phones may not do that well but personally i think they will do well enough and then continue to rise until they are right there with apple and google    ms is also much closer to a unified platform for you tv i think the last decade or so of work is coming to a pinnacle for ms and so far so good really windows 7 phones get decent reviews they just lack exposure and a healthy app market so did the first xbox and now ms fairly easily dominates the console market and will almost certainly beat sony to the next generation of consoles while expanding their game selection faster    while apple sales wo n't get hurt as bad i think an ms phone will eventually give them trouble and when you own the pc and console markets already selling a phone platform should n't be that hard people want a unified platform that is all made to work together and soon ms will finally be able to offer that and the new xbox will make it that much better    many of you may see ms as waning in recent years i think they have been quietly putting the finishing touches on their death star the unified pc mobile and console market apple and google have nothing close to that

i have done something similar to this myself   what you are suggesting is a sound theory and it works   the issues are which is why it 's the reason not everyone does it the initial cost is great many people in their 20s or 30s can not afford their own home let alone buy second properties   the time to build up a portfolio is very long term and is best for a pension investment   it 's often not best for diversification you 've heard not putting all your eggs in one basket with property deposits you need to put a lot of eggs in to make it work and this can leave you vulnerable there can be lots of work involved renovating is a huge pain and cost and you 've already mentioned not paying   unlike a bank account or bonds shares etc   you can not get to your savings investments quickly if you need to or find an opportunity   but after considering these and deciding the plunge is worth it i would say go for it be a good landlord with good quality property and you 'll have a great nest egg   if you try just one and see how it goes with population increase in a safe respectable location the value of the investment should continue to rise which it does n't in a bank and you can expect a rental return very hard to find in cash account   hope it goes well

congratulations on seeing your situation clearly that 's half the battle to prevent yourself from going back into debt you should get rid of any credit cards you have and close the accounts just use your debit card your post indicates you 're not the type to splurge and get stuff just because you want it so saving for a larger purchase and paying cash for it is probably something you 're willing to do contrary to popular belief you can live just fine without a credit card and without a credit score if you 're never going back into debt you do n't need a credit score buying a house is possible without one but is admittedly more work for you and for the underwriters because they ca n't just ask the fico god to bless you they have to actually see your finances and you have to actually have some i realize many folks will hate this advice but i am actually living it and life is pretty good if you 're in school look at how much you spend on food while on campus $ for lunch adds up to $ over a month m f four weeks buy groceries and pack a lunch if you can if your expenses can not be reduced anymore you 're going to have to get a job there is nothing wrong with slowing down your studies and working a job to get your income up above your expenses it stinks being a poor student but it stinks even more to be a poor student with a mountain of debt you 'll find that working a job does n't slow you down all that much tons of students work their way through school and graduate in plenty of time to get a good job   good luck to you you can do it

thanks for your question dai the circumstances under which these buyouts can occur is based on the us takeover code and related legislation as well as the laws of the state in which the company is incorporated it 's not actually the case that a company such as dell needs to entice or force every shareholder to sell what is salient is the conditions under which the bidder can acquire a controlling interest in the target company and effect a merger this usually involves acquiring at least a majority of the outstanding shares methods of acquisition the quickest way for a company to be acquired is the one step method in this case the bidder simply calls for a shareholder vote if the shareholders approve the terms of the offer the deal can go forward any legal or other to the deal in the two step method which is the case with dell the bidder issues a tender offer which you mentioned where the current shareholders can agree to sell their shares to the bidder usually at a premium if the bidder secures the acceptance of 90 of the shares they can immediately go forward with what is called a short form merger and can effect the merger without ever calling for a shareholder meeting or vote any stockholders that hold out and do not want to sell are squeezed out once the merger has been effected but retain the right to redeem their outstanding shares at the valuation of the tender offer in the case you mentioned if shareholders controlling 25 of the shares not necessarily 25 of the shareholders were to oppose the tender offer there would be alternatives if the bidder did not have at least 51 of the shares secured they would likely either increase the valuation of the tender offer or choose to abandon the takeover if the bidder had 51 or more of the shares secured but not 90 they could issue a proxy statement call for a shareholder meeting and a vote to effect the merger or they could increase the tender offer in order to try to secure 90 of the shares in order to effect the short form merger if the bidder is able to secure even 51 of the shares either through the proxy or by way of a controlling interest along with a consortium of other shareholders they are able to effect the merger and squeeze out the remaining shareholders at the price of the tender offer majority rules some states laws specify additional circumstances under which the bidder can force the current shareholders to exchange their shares for cash or converted shares but not delaware where dell is incorporate there are also several special cases with a top up provision if the company 's board management is in favor of the merger they can simply issue more and more shares until the bidder has acquired 90 of the total outstanding shares needed for the short form merger top up provisions are very common in cases of a tender offer if the board management opposes the merger this is considered a hostile and they can effect poison pill measures which have the opposite effect of a top up and dilute the bidders percent of outstanding shares however if the bidder can secure 51 of the shares they can simply vote to replace the current board who can then replace the current management such that the new board and management will put into place whatever provisions are amenable to the bidder in the case of a short form merger or a vote to effect a merger the shareholders who do not wish to sell have the right to sell at the tender price or they can oppose the deal on legal grounds by arguing that the valuation of the tender offer is materially unfair however there are very few cases which i 'm aware of where this type of challenge has been successful however they do not have the power to stop the merger which has been agreed to by the majority of the shareholders this is similar to how when the president is elected the minority voters ca n't stop the new president from being or how you can be affected if you own a condo and the condo owners association votes to change the rules in a way you do n't like tough luck for you if you do n't like it if you want more detail i 'd recommend checking out a web guide from 2011 here as well as related articles from the harvard law blog here i hope that helps

in a nutshell value added tax america as usual what others have known and used for years the idea of not taxing income that 's tied to it is ridiculous if you 're only taxing spending but not income people will just take spending elsewhere canada mexico further away and the economy will go down the drain that 's similar to the way people avoid paying sales tax now except that it will be in orders of magnitude why should a corporation by office supplies in the us if it has a branch in china edit also fair tax does n't take into account moving money overseas i 've mentioned living elsewhere down below and that also got me thinking of how i personally would certainly gain from that ridiculous thing called fair tax basically that 's exactly how the rich folks those who push for it will gain from it being able to move money out of the us basically makes it a perfect tax shelter you do n't pay taxes on the income that you have in the us and you do n't pay taxes on the spendings that you have elsewhere because in that country income is taxable so you only pay vat or sales taxes this means that all the wealthy people while investing and gaining money from the american economy stocks property etc will actually not be spending it in the us thus no taxes paid to the us dollars flowing out perfect actually i should be all for this stupid idea very fair to me no need to pay any taxes at all because food will probably be exempt anyway

i 've had a hard time finding out details on remortgaging help to buy loans myself but found one article which points out it is possible   but also that there are n't many lenders offering such deals out there   the article lists a number of lenders that do offer these programs and the extra requirements on equity you might have to have it sounds like it 's going to be critical to know how much equity you 've built up    since part of the valuation increase will be credited to help to buy you wo n't get all the £ 30k increase you 've mentioned   instead i believe you 'll only get 80 so £ 24k    which would mean your total equity is £ 24k + £ 7k = £ plus whatever you might have already paid off   i 'm going to assume there is n't much you 've paid off so will assume just over 18 while this is higher than most of the equity limits mentioned in the above article keep in mind you 'd only get cash out corresponding to the difference between your current equity amount and the equity required for the loan   for example if you went with a loan requiring 15 equity to qualify you 'd only have 3 over that and thus get £ out    and that 's before any fees you might have to pay   you might have new origination fees but you also might have early repayment fees maybe you could pursue a lower money down refi and get to keep more but the same article points out that help to buy might consider that too risky for you and refuse to allow the refi i think it 's worth shopping around to get actual numbers for your exact situation but personally it does n't sound like you have enough equity yet to get much cash out of a refi   perhaps you 'll get lucky though   best of luck

let 's talk on qe by m.    20   september   2012   thursday ph    i want to share this to all the brilliant economists in this world    let 's talk on qe     by   m.   qe is not a cure it is a qe is synthetic no more no less qe is artificial it can not and will never hold water qe is only a temporary relief not an outright total solutions qe is absolutely not a guaranty not an assurance for recovery or growth qe is a very good tool this acts as an oxygen to a dying patients to breathe qe is now and forever taking away the oxygen the patient will going to die qe is a big balloon continues to expand amplify waiting to explode to burst qe will keep you moving today but not for the rest of your life qe is the more you move the more you get sucked down qe will bring joy today later it will bring tears pouring in your eyes that could not stop qe is worthless injecting precious blood highly precious dollar to a zombie economy a economy an absolute waste qe is brainless simply do not know what will going to be the consequences to the economy do not have the idea of what will going to be the final result qe is only a dream being over optimistic that one day everything will go back to normal that at the end of the day the economy will recover and finally would realize growth qe is just a fantasy meaning punching the moon the stars thinking it will resolve the year 2008 economic meltdown qe is an investment yes a massive investments to a dying economy absolutely wrong investments qe will keep you running it is like a ticking time bomb qe is not good for the economy the government acts or play as an investor instead of the businessman qe is being very kind and generous to businessman while keeping the country the state 's economy at stake or in jeopardy qe is putting more money to a business supporting the company to stay to exist for the time being and later on will literally closed shop qe is killing the mighty precious dollar slowly but surely qe is hide and seek like suze orman of cnbc say 's show me the money qe is treasure hunting ultra rich millionaires billionaires is keeping it they hide it where are those precious dollars making the economy sick crippled dead qe is a money making machine printing press once the economy becomes weak all they have to do is just print qe is putting plenty of money to a basket full of holes truly very few will benefit and so many will going to suffer   this is inequality   disparity is very disturbing counter to a good economy qe is experimental trial and error testing probability never done before qe is good at the start year 2008 after spending investing releasing trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars big companies millions of jobs were blessed saved rescued   and like magic america the wealthiest and most powerful country in the   universe is now going to act again today to spend invest release again and again and again and again trillions and trillions of mighty precious dollars for the economy to keep moving my god what an abnormal cycle of the economy qe is a wild guess absolutely speculative before only big businesses huge companies are at stake   today it is now the whole country is at risk   not yet talking of the whole wide world with special mention to my my beloved country the philippines   this is certainly   absolutely domino effect   no one not one will ever be spared qe is very before only america needs to be saved to be today all countries is in distress suffering badly needs a rescue qe is keeping inflation very low yes absolutely for today but not for tomorrow   the medicine that they used during the 2008 economic slump is luckily still moving   meaning still working    but once this medicine starts to slowdown and begins to die down   you may call all the saints above   and the true inflation you are looking for searching for will surely and definitely come into your midst    inflation will going to kill us all qe is a wrong medicine temporary patch or qe is it is just an easy money and definitely not a hard earned labor generated money qe is a gamble trillion dollars is at stake if we are lucky the dying person or the economy will live if we are not lucky the dying person will die the economy will going to collapsed and still we have to pay all the debts as long as we live qe is the economy today is at the mercy of qe   the economy is captive hostage by qe interest rates is a lose lose situations keeping it zero   the u.s.a government will lose trillions   and trillions of dollars that is badly needed   now raising this rates will surely and definitely starts   the u.s.a markets and precisely the world economy to react pulling down the unstable economies   of the whole world to jeopardy   now which one would you like to choose again which one would you prefer qe is trial and error a complex complicated solutions   healing one part of the body and the other part will swell and burst qe is evaporation using taxpayers money pension funds retirement benefits and all entitlements is going to fade will vanished in thin air qe are waiters simply waiting day and night for growth for recovery qe is it dries up the u.s.a treasury qe is debt a never ending debt keep in mind there is no such thing as unlimited debt or debt unlimited do n't be fooled qe will going to keep you in good sleep but will wake you up bankrupt qe is not an answer it is the culprit qe is universal it was copied all over the world worldwide qe is an absolute solutions yes for all dumb economists a hopeless desperate solutions qe to be specific is going back again to the 1930 's depression or the great depression part 2 yes precisely but with a big bang qe before is only a staggering risk today it is now debt simple as it keeps on giving birth by the hour the minutes the seconds and after eight long years the final   the end result is massive pure debt very sorry to say not growth and or definitely not recovery qe is a dying move no one not one ever dared to affirm to attest to certify that this is a correct solutions qe is mad it will make you crazy because of debt qe is the only options yes absolutely when your big brains is not working qe is easing the pain correct for a very short period of time but will going to destroy the economy in the long or short run qe is history it will you forever and ever qe what more can i say    fb

these are two rather distinct questions only one of which is relevant to a money web site in general the investment is questionable   leaving aside the green feel good factor you need to look at a total cost of ownership and payback on the asset   neither is cheap as such   there are diy plans but you likely still need a commercial battery charger controller setup government incentives depending on where you live may change the story considerably   many jurisdictions around the globe have both incentives to install and then power feed in tariffs if you sell back excess power your latitude also has an impact on your total available solar energy along with regular weather patterns for both cloud cover and wind one of the cheapest solar projects can be hot water   particularly if you have a pool or even for domestic use if you use a lot all that said given the green feel good factor if you want a small set of solar panels and have the space budget go ahead   you can add more later for the second question it is indeed possible to live off grid   some remote houses do just this and the methods to accomplish it vary   the number one thing you need to do is work on a power budget and be both ruthless as well as realistic   fridge freezer ac furnace plasma tv etc   depending on your climate and preferences these may not all be possible for an off grid lifestyle   of course if you get a propane fridge and have a truck come by once a month does that count as off grid

i can think of one major income source you did n't mention dividends   rather than withdrawing from your pension pot you can roll it over to a sipp invest it in quality dividend growth stocks then depending on your pension size withdraw only the dividends to live on the goal here is that you buy quality dividend growth stocks    this will mean you rarely have to sell your investments and can weather the ups and downs of the market in relative comfort while using the dividends as your income to live off of    the growth aspect comes into play when considering keeping up with inflation or simply growing your income    in effect companies grow the size of their dividend payments and you use that to beat the effects of inflation meanwhile you do get the benefit of principle growth in the companies you 've invested in    i do n't know the history of the uk stock market but the us market has averaged over 7 total return including dividends over the long term a typical dividend payout is not much better than your annuity option though 3 to 4 is probably achievable    although looking at the list of uk dividend champion list companies that have grown their dividend for 25 years continuous some of them have higher yields than that right now    though that might be a warning sign btw given all the legal changes around buy to lets recently increases stamp duty on purchase reduction in mortgage interest deduction increased paperwork burden due to right to rent laws etc you want to check this carefully to make sure you 're safe on forecasting your return

i think that is the wrong approach you certainly need to teach the value of work but you can not tie it to income levels as a hard and fast rule if you do how do you then explain athletes making millions per year and only working half a year at most and then comparing that person to a person working hard in a factory 40 50 hours per week 50 weeks per year bringing home $ 50 k per year i 've always taught my kids to work hard and with integrity and most importantly you better enjoy the work you do because no matter how much money you make if you dread getting up in the morning to go to work your money wo n't make you happy i 've never focused on the amount of money they should be making

there seems to be a contradiction here home warranties not worth paper they 're written on and what struck us is that the immediately had the unit replaced there is a huge difference when you buy the insurance yourself and when a bank forces you to buy one because in the latter case the insurance is not for you it 's for the bank to protect their collateral which is your asset as well it becomes obvious when a claim comes up because the insurer is not negotiating with you it 's negotiating with another large financial institution and as far as the stereotype of banks being ruthless behemoths goes in this case you happen to benefit from being on the behemoth 's side and the insurer simply ca n't brush off a bank as much as it can brush off a person like you as you 've put it a house in phoenix without ac is not worth much so the bank could not let that happen because in case of another foreclosure they would have to fix the ac anyway

its much less likely for that to happen now as it was 20 or 30 years ago   see the link i just p the positions of europe and the us have to some degree reversed looking at the bright side for wealthy people the us is a good place for wealthy people to live because the chance of them getting poorer than their parents is substantially lower than in other countries    on the other hand if you are poor you have a better chance of moving to a higher income bracket in most western european countries than you do in the us of course as recently as the 80s the situation was reversed and it could easily reverse again    the statistics in the us are much better if you are an immigrant for some reason this income does n't seem to hold as true for immigrant families as it does for american families that have been here for several generations

if someone owns a house that is not paid off can someone buy it by taking another mortgage yes but i 'm not sure why you think the buyer would need to take another mortgage to buy it if someone sells their home for x dollars then the buyer needs x dollars to buy the house how they get that money use cash take out a mortgage is up to them during the closing process a portion of the funds generated from the sale are diverted to pay off the seller 's loan and any leftover funds after closing are pocketed by the seller what kind of offer would be most sensible i assume that in this case the current owner of the house would want to make a profit the amount that the house is sold for is determined by the market value of their home not by the size of the mortgage they have left to pay off you make the same offer whether they own their home or have a mortgage

its almost always better to pay off loans sooner rather than later    being debt free is amazingly    however in your case i 'd be reluctant to make significant headway on a loan repayment program   here 's why the best investment you can make right now is in yourself   completing your education should be the top priority   the next would be to meet the requirements of a job after received after school is complete   so what i would do is estimate the amount of money it would take to complete school   add to that an estimate of an amount to move to a new city and setup a household    that amount should be held in reserve   anything above that can used to pay down loans once you complete school and get settled into a job you can then take that money and also throw it at your loans

intuitive i doubt it derivatives are not the simplest thing to understand   the price is either in the money or it is n't by the way exactly at the money is not in the money an option that 's not in the money has time value only as the price rises and the option is more and more in the money the time value drops we have a $ 40 stock it makes sense to me that a $ 40 strike price is all just a bet the stock will rise there 's no intrinsic value the option prices at about $ 4.00 for one year out with 25 volatility but the strike of $ 30 is at $ with $ 10 in the money and only in time premium there 's a great calculator on line to tinker with   volatility is a key component of options trading think about it if a stock rises but rarely goes up any more or less just steady up why would you even buy an option that was even 10 out of the money the only way i can describe this is to look at a bell curve and how there 's a 1/6 chance the event will be above one standard deviation if that standard deviation is small the chance of hitting the higher strikes is also small   i wrote an article betting on apple at 9 to 2 in which i describe how a pair of option trades was set up so that a 35 rise in apple stock would return and apple had two years to reach its target i offer this as an example of options trading not being theory but something that many are engaged in what i found curious about the trade was that apple 's volatility was high enough that a 35 move did n't seem like the 4.5 to 1 risk the market said it was as of today apple needs to rise 13 in the next 10 months for the trade to pay off disclosure the long time to expiration was both good and bad two years to recover 35 seemed reasonable but 2 years could bring anything in the macro sense another recession some worldwide event that would impact apple 's market etc the average investor will not have the patience for these long term option trades

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

colloquially there 's no difference except for the level of risk which is an estimate anyway investment is creating wealth through improvement or production   purchasing a house with the intent to renovate and sell it for a profit would be an investment as the house is worth more when you sell than when you bought it speculation on the other hand is when you hope to make a profit through changes in the market itself   purchasing a house letting it sit for 6 months and selling it for a profit would be speculation

one thing to be aware of when choosing mutual funds and index etfs is the total fees and costs the td ameritrade site almost certainly had links that would let you see the total fees as an annual percentage for each of the funds within a category the lowest fees percentage is best since that is directly subtracted from your performance as an aside your allocation seems overly conservative to me for someone that is 25 years old you will likely work for 40 or so years and the average stock market cycle is about 7 years so you will likely see 5 or so complete cycles worrying about stability of principal too young will really cut into your returns my daughter is your age and i have advised her to be 100 in equities and then to start dialing that back in about 25 years or so

first i 'd like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means   i have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations and they barely scrape by month to month if we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month we get about $ 1,350   you say that $ per month is the minimum payment for your loans which have an average interest rate of about 3.5   thus you have about $ 1,350 a month to invest making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate when it comes down to it   an interest rate of 3.5 is not great all things considered and barely above inflation     however that 's a guaranteed return of 3.5 more or less like a bond   as noted previously the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run the us stock market is right around its historic high at this point djia is at today april 6th 2017 historic high hit just over on march 1 2017   obviously no one can predict the future but i get the feeling that a market correction may be in order especially depending on how things go in washington in the next weeks or months   if that 's the case again we have no way of knowing if it is you 'd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point what i would do given your situation is invest the $ in a portfolio that 's 50/50 stocks and bonds where the bonds here are your student loans   here you have a guaranteed return of on the bond portion and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends capital gains etc over time   i would apply the extra loan payments to the highest interest loan first paying only the minimum to the others   once the highest interest loan is paid off move onto the next one once you have all your loans paid off your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a or 80/20 split depending on what you want   i 'm assuming you 're pretty young so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well that and the fact that you wo n't really have much invested anyway again let me stress that neither i nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market i 'm just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if i were in your shoes

having been in the situation of commuting and working long hours at a low wage to just scrape by i faced the following dilemma i used all my income to pay bills and taxes and could not afford to go back to college to get another degree or pay for distance learning even if i could afford to pay for classes i could n't figure out when i 'd have the time to study because i was often only home 9 hours a day and needed to eat and sleep shower and get ready for work a wealthy friend of mine liked to read books about people who great obstacles and she was sure i could figure out lot a way to improve my situation if i 'd just try harder one day i handed her a piece of paper showing my income after taxes and monthly bills and asked her to get back to me with a plan that would allow me to afford classes and give me say an average of 6 hours of study time per week she was happy to do it here was her for opportunity to show me it was possible to pull myself up by my bootstraps after she studied my income expenses and schedule she decided she could n't devise a plan that would work and she never again told me i was n't trying hard enough

when you adjust your investments the following will happen initial condition modified condition this means that after this change you will note that the amount of federal tax you pay each month via withholding will go up you are now contributing less pre tax so your taxable income has increased if you make no other changes then in april you will either have increased your refund by 6 months x the additional $ 25 a month or decreased the amount you owe by the same amount there is no change in the total 401 k balance at the end of the year other than accounting for how much is held pre tax vs. roth post tax keep in mind that employer contributions must be pre tax the company could never guess what your tax situation is they withhold money for taxes based on the form you fill out but they have no idea of your family 's tax situation if you fail to have enough withheld you pay the penalty not the company the tax savings are complex because it depends on marital status your other pre tax amounts for medical and how much income your spouse makes plus your other income and deductions

that 's just it though they are splitting up the 1 and in most cases especially vanguard they are splitting up far less   etfs do n't have 12b-1 fees explaining why you 're experiencing different returns for etfs will almost certainly involve something other than their expense again this is especially true for vanguard they have the cheapest etfs around though i think schwab beats them on a few now   i can only guess at the full compensation structure betterment likely earns money on cash reserves and   securities i guess they also charge a small fee from what i understand finance is very slim these days   i guess i 'm wondering what your ultimate question is if it 's the inter corporate compensation structure above is my best guess if it 's about performance then we need to compare the etfs you are looking at if it 's about the fees on funds i think we covered that   as an advisor it 's my experience that very specific inquiries about fees have a deeper concern people hear a lot about being overcharged so cost is a very standard place for clients to initially look when trying to compare performance of portfolios or securities

yeah i was a libertarian until they said they want to end the federal reserve i 'm more of a conservative    your point that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a livable wage is irrelevant wages are a   fee given to employees for their work the way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage if the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he 's paid an employer will lay off that individual because the employee costs the employer money therefore setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage furthermore the higher you set the minimum wage the more people you deprive of jobs

as others have noted us law says that if you have over half the bill it 's worth the full value under half is worth nothing i presume if it is very close to half if even careful measurements show that you have you 'll have difficulty cashing it in precisely because the government and the banking system are n't going to allow themselves to be easily fooled by someone cutting bills in half and then trying to redeem both halves i 've seen several comments on here about how you 'd explain to the bank how so many bills were cut in half what if you just told them the truth not the part about killing someone of course but tell them that you made a deal neither of you wanted to bother with complex contracts and having to go to court if the other side did n't pay up so your buddy cut all the bills in half etc as you now have both halves and they clearly have the same serial number this no real evidence of fraud okay this is technically illegal 18 us code section whoever cuts or or or together or does any other thing to any bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association or federal reserve bank or the federal reserve system with intent to render such bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt unfit to be shall be fined under this title or not more than six months or both but you did n't do it the other guy did i presume the point of this law is to say that you ca n't get a hold of currency belonging to someone else and it so as to make it worthless as he 's now given you both halves i doubt anyone would bother to track him down and prosecute him just btw while checking up on the details of the law i stumbled across 18 usc 336 which says that it 's illegal to write a check for less than $ 1 with penalties of 6 months in prison i just got a check from at&t for 15 cents for one of those class action suits where the lawyers get $ 100 million and the victims get 15 cents each apparently that was illegal

it is my understanding that banks pay less than the going rate on savings accounts and require that the person who takes out a loan pay more than the going rate that is how the bank gets its money   usually the going rate is affected by the current inflation rate but that has not been true for the last few weeks so that means that typically the money you have in the bank is gradually losing purchasing power as the bank typically pays you less than the inflation rate   so if you want your money to keep pace with inflation or do a bit better then you should buy bonds

note that we do not comment on specific stocks here and have no place doing so if your question is only about that specific stock then it is off topic i have not tried to answer that part below the key to valuation is predicting the net present value of all of a company 's cash flows i.e. of their future profits and losses through a number of methods to long to explain here investment banks and hedge funds work out what they expect the company 's cash flows to be and trade so that these future profits losses etc are priced into the stock price since future cash flows profits or whatever you want to call them are priced in the price of a stock should n't move at all on an earnings statement this begs the question why do some stock prices move violently when they announce earnings the models that the institutional investors use are not perfect and can not take into account everything an unexpected craze for a product or a supply chain agreement breaking down on not being as good as it seems will not be factored into this pricing and so the price will move based on the degree to which expectation is missed or exceeded since penny socks are speculative their value is based far more on the long term expected cash flows and less on the short run cash flows this goes a long way to explaining why some of the highest market capitalisation penny stocks are those making consistent losses this means that they can be far less susceptible to price movements after an earnings announcement even if it is well out of the consensus range higher potential future value comes with the higher risks of penny stocks which discounts current value in the end if people 's expectation of the company 's performance reflects reality then the profitability is priced in and there will be no price movement if the actuality is outside of the expected range then there will be a price movement

agree with randy if debt and debt reduction was all about math nobody would be in debt   it is an emotional game if you 've taken care of the reasons you 're in debt changed your behaviors then start focusing on the math of getting it done faster    otherwise if you do n't have a handle on the behaviors that got you there you 're just going to get more rope to hang yourself with   i.e. makes sense to take a low interest home equity loan to pay off high interest credit card debt but more likely than not you 'll just re rack up the debt on the cards because you never fixed the behavior that put you into debt same thing here if you opt not to contribute to pay off the cards without fixing the debt accumulating behaviors what you 're going to do is stay in debt and not provide for retirement take the match until you 're certain you have your debt accumulation habits in check

right but there were tangible reasons that made sense that was fueled by a cycle of predatory loans and consumers being dumb enough to think that just because they got approved for a $ 500 k house with a 500 credit score meant they should definitely take out massive loans and buy it this was piled on by the derivative market specifically credit default swaps which certain people recognized as creating a liquidity issue they did n't know when the crash was going to occur they just knew that the asset bubble fueled by massive debt with this debt being falsely rated as aaa when most of it was junk left banks in a position of complete insolvency when the mortgage defaults reached a certain point when people realized the extent of the debt e.g. knowing with common sense that people with a 550 credit score should n't have 7 properties and be allowed to be that over leveraged let alone be rated aaa and the amount of derivatives that would have to be paid out on top of having no cash flow due to mortgage defaults they recognized that a bubble bursting would wreak havoc on the economy        that had a lot of moving parts simply saying overvalued record highs crash coming soon when how is fucking stupid nobody knows what evidence did op offer not that he would n't still get laughed out because this topic is fucking annoying with thousands of people crying overvalued but he did n't even mention p e ratio or anything he literally came in and basically said when is it all gon na fall apart nobody knows the answer

most 0 interest loans have quite high interest rates that are deferred if you are late on a payment you are hit with all the deferred interest they 're banking on a percentage of customers missing a payment   also this is popular in furniture car sales because it 's a way to get people to buy who otherwise would n't they made money on the item sale so the loan does n't have to earn them money even though some will traditional banks lenders do make money from interest and rely on that they would have to rely on fees if interest were not permitted

a breakdown of stock buy backs has this bottom line on it are share buybacks good or bad as is so often the case in finance the question may not have a definitive answer if a stock is undervalued and a buyback truly represents the best possible investment for a company the buyback and its effects can be viewed as a positive sign for shareholders watch out however if a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios provide short term relief to an ailing stock price or to get out from under excessive dilution read more what is the reason that a company like aapl is buying back its own    shares   offsetting dilution would be my main thought here as many employees may exercise options putting more stock out there that the company buys back stock to balance things does it have too much cash and it does n't know what to do with it   no as it could do dividends if it wanted to give it back to investors so it is returning the cash back to investors not quite while some investors may get cash from apple i 'd suspect most shareholders are n't likely to see cash unless they are selling their shares so i would n't say yes to this without qualification at the same time the treasury shares apple has can be used to give options to employees or be used in acquisitions for a couple of other purposes

i have a couple other important considerations regarding external hsa accounts vs employer sponsored hsa accounts depending on your personal financial situation and goals some people like to use hsa accounts as an extra retirement account since the money can be withdrawn penalty free in retirement for non medical expenses and completely tax penalty free at any time for medical expenses if your intended use for the hsa account is an investment vehicle for retirement then you may find more use benefit out of an external provider that may provide more or better investment options than your employers hsa investment options there can be a lot of additional value in those extra investment options over greater periods of time another very important consideration for fica taxes fica includes social security medicare that i do n't believe was mentioned before for those earners who are under the maximum social security wage limit you are paying 6.2 of each paycheck into social security taxes as others have mentioned you can save this tax through your employer ’s plan if you set up the account to be funded pre tax from your paychecks however in doing so you are lowering your overall contributions into social security which may lower your social security benefits in your retirement years   if this is ultimately going to lower your ssa benefits in retirement then that is a big future cost that may steer you against the pre tax employer contributions think of social security as part of your retirement plan not as a tax but instead as an additional check you put away for yourself for retirement every month of course this is only an important consideration if ssa is still going to be around when you retire but let 's assume that it will be this is not an issue for higher earners earning well above the max ssa taxable wages there is no wage limit on the 1.45 medicare tax withholding 's and there is certainly no harm in saving medicare taxes because it will not affect future medicare benefits so for taxpayers earning well over the max ssa wages they will just save the 1.45 medicare taxes without affecting their ssa contributions and resulting retirement benefits   so again it all comes down to personal situations depending on your earnings and goals employer plan may or may not be the way to go   personally for my lower earning clients friends and family i tend to recommend that they do whatever they can to maximize their social security benefits in retirement so i would advise them to either use the external provider account or the employer plan but with post tax contributions so you do n't lower the ssa withholding 's but can still claim the income tax deduction on your tax return ymmv

in the us money talks and bullshit walks you can skip any credit history requirement if you demonstrate your ability to pay in a very obvious way credit history is just a standardized way of weeding out people that can not reliably pay instead of having to listen to an individual 's excuses about how the bank their account five times while they were waiting for their friend to pay them back for bubble gum if you can show up with a wad of cash you can get the car or the apartment or the bank account without the troubles of everyone else   but you can begin building credit with a secured credit card pretty easily this will be useful for things like utilities and sometimes jobs also banks wo n't be opposed to giving you credit if you have a lot of money in an account with them you should be able to maintain an exemption from all socioeconomic problems in the united states solely due to your experience with money and assets

that is not true leads can cost anywhere from a penny to over $ 50.00 depending on how you define the word lead roi is supposed to reflect this if i invest $ on a marketing campaign and i close 5 deals for a net profit of 2k each then i spent 5k to make 10k it does n't matter if i put up a billboard mailed or did a email campaign   4 cost per order lead for acquisition campaigns were roughly equivalent for all the channels the most notable result from the 2012 response rate report may be the fact that ultimately the cost for acquiring a lead ended up in the same ballpark no matter what the channel direct mail $ $ email $ and paid search $ all produced comparable numbers in this arena

i understand the question i think the tough thing is that trades over the next brief time are random or appear so so just as when a stock is $ 10.00 bid $ ask if you place an order below the ask a tick down in price may get you a fill or if the next trades are flat to higher you might see the close at $ 10.50 and no fill as it never went down to your limit   this process is no different for options than for stocks   when i want to trade options i make sure the strike has decent volume and enter a market order edit i a bit to clarify the black scholes is a model not a rigid equation say i discover an option that 's underpriced but it trades under right until it expires it 's not like there 's a reversion to the mean that will occur there are some very sophisticated traders who use these tools to trade in some very high volumes for them it may produce results for the small trader you need to know why you want to buy a stock or its option and not worry about the last $ 0.25 of its price

first ianal this is going to depend on the kind of points if it 's an internal point system that the business is doing on their own then they may very well give you that many extra points they may really not care specially if the cost of the points is low enough remember that steak dinner that you paid $ 60 for only really cost them $ 2 and that they use $ 60 worth of points on it   if the point system is tied to a bank or credit card then it 's far more likely that the just use them is not the proper answer the company doing the reimbursing is giving the location $ 60 and using your points the points have a much higher value   with that said your responsibility is to notify and follow their rules so notify them in writing and use the rewards card as you normally would if your being honest then the worst that happens is that your point balance is a little negative because you spent 100 points but really only had 98 after adjustment   most likely if your being honest they will just eat the few points over that you went on accident   if you get an answer in writing to just keep the points then i guess you know where your daughter 's wedding reception will be let 's hope it 's a place of course as a good person or maybe a stupid person i should call them wait 30 minutes in the queue and then try to explain the issue to the service desk i actually did that and the guy thought i am nuts to even call and told me to just use them they are yours now i do n't feel like calling again and again until i get someone that believes it just to return them their points you will want to do this in writing email will work but you really want a paper trail either way i could just toss the card and forget about it however i had quite some points on it that really belong to me so that feels like i pay for their fault there is no need to do this it 's like a bank error talk to them and they will give you an answer in the mean time do your best to only use the points you actually have use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right probably nobody will ever care let 's keep religious considerations out here what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day in the far future i understand this borders on a legal question nope do n't do this if you play dumb and spend 5000 points when you know you only have around 100 best case scenario you end up with points effectively canceling the benefit of the card you may also be banned form the program the location the network etc worst case scenario they want the monetary value of the points and sue you for it and the legal fees it may even be considered fraud   tl;dr use your card but be honest and handle the mistake in writing

traditional ira contributions can be made if you   have compensation and the amount of the contribution is limited to the smaller of your compensation and $ 5500 $ 6000 if age 50 or more note that compensation which generally means earnings form working is not just what appears on a w-2 form as salary or wages it can be   earnings from self employment too as well as commissions alimony etc but not earnings from property pensions and annuities certain types of partnership income you must also not have attained age 70.5 in the year for which the contribution is made   even if you do n't have any compensation of your own you can nonetheless make a traditional ira contribution if your spouse has compensation as long as you are filing a joint tax return with your spouse for spouses filing a joint return the   limits are still the same $ for each spouse and the sum total of traditional ira contributions for both spouses also must not exceed the sum total of earned income of both spouses the age limits etc are all still applicable note that none of this says anything about whether the contributions are deductible   everyone meeting the above requirements is eligible to make contributions to a traditional ira whether the contributions can be deducted from current income depends on the income   those with high enough incomes can not deduct the contribution this is different from roth iras to which people with high incomes are not permitted to make a contribution at all finally the source of the cash you contribute to the ira can be the proceeds of the stock sale if you like you are not required to prove that the cash received from compensation is what you sent to the ira custodian read publication 590 available on the irs website if you need an authoritative reference

the weird thing is that if you use the credit impact with the credit monitoring services they show that the impact of paying your credit cards off completely is more negative than carrying a small balance which does n't make a great deal of sense one would think   from what i can gather the rationale is that carrying a small balance shows you making payments over time as opposed to having a zero balance   this does n't quite compute with me but i do n't truly understand the inner workings of the scoring models   to confirm this i used with both transunion and experian and both showed this   i know that it 's easy to find people on both sides of this argument so i ca n't say which is the best option certainly whichever side someone falls on is the one they 'll argue is the right one chuckle in all fairness your best tool is time   the effects of your prior bad decisions will lessen over time as they move further away in your history and then disappear altogether   obtaining a credit card just because you think you need one is not a compelling argument by any means   if you ca n't rationalize reasons why you need it then maybe you should question the wisdom of such a decision   if you do n't have a particular need for better credit right now why be in a hurry to take on debt whatever the formulas are for calculating credit scores the specific details are a pretty closely guarded secret they 're proprietary for starters plus it theoretically prevents people from gaming the system for a better score but if you do enough research online you can get a pretty good sense of how they work in general whatever you do with your credit should be in line with your overall financial goals   if you want to remain debt free at least for now then having a credit card you ca n't otherwise justify a need for just introduces which could prove tough to resist wants quickly turn into needs when you can put it on a card you pay later then you 're right back in the same place you were earlier in your life instead of trying to figure out the best strategy for a credit card first ask yourself how necessary it is to you right now in light of your financial objectives then go from there i hope this helps good luck

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

we are talking at cross purposes but not for the reason you think    the debt might or might not be legally or practically recoverable the apple farmer and everything he owns might have been destroyed in the fire but the value created and destroyed was real and so was the money    you 're focusing on the debt owed to the shoemaker which is fine but your mistake is thinking that the debt is in some way meaningfully different from money which it 's not    most people who try to explain this difference would go off on a about how the overwhelming majority of money on deposit in banks and otherwise in circulation has never been printed or something which is okay but it 's not a very convincing argument because you 'll come back with something like but i can still withdraw all my money i can still cash all my checks etc   so instead i 'm going to try and break this down bear with me   the apple grower got a deer worth 12 loddars let 's set the interest part aside for the moment i got a pair shoes also worth loddars   forget about the shoe maker and the debt for a moment and focus on me i sold a deer and i used the proceeds to buy a pair of shoes    did i defraud anyone no i engaged in a fair transaction with willing partners on both sides    did i get paid for the deer obviously i did because i used the payment to buy shoes    what did i get paid with if not money    i can hear you saying yeah but the shoe guy    forget about the shoe guy when buy something on amazon marketplace and charge it on a credit card and then get paid via direct deposit and then have the money taken from your account to pay off the credit card company electronically is all of that real money of course it is    now what happens if you die before paying the the credit card bill does that mean that the money amazon paid to the seller does n't exist   does that mean that money paid by the cc company to amazon does n't exist how about the money in your bank account does that exist what if your employer once defrauded someone how about then    none of that money has ever been printed nobody got permission from ben bernanke to authorize these transactions but the money that changed hands was absolutely real even though it was nothing more than a series of promises    before you argue with me think this through all these account transfers ultimately boil down to promises by the end bank to produce cash when and if the account holder walks up to a teller and demands it the bank does n't have nearly enough cash to pay every account holder but they do have enough hopefully to keep their promises since they know they wo n't all be called in at once    nobody ever actually delivered a package of paper currency to cover these transactions everyone is just trading promises and passing those promises along to others it sounds crazy to say it that way but it is absolutely true    tally up your net worth or if that 's too ugly imagine up someone 's net worth who has a net worth chances are that you have never in your life seen that amount of paper cash certainly not in your physical possession so who has it it 's not like your local bank branch has a box marked with $ 400,000 in bills and coins sitting there    what you have is a series of promises    when your employer gets by credit card the customer promises to pay the credit card company who promises to pay your employer 's bank your employer then pays you with a direct deposit whereby his bank promises to pay your bank you then swipe an atm card and your bank promises to pay the grocery store 's bank who in turn sends a check to their supplier which is a promise that the grocery store 's bank will pay the supplier 's bank who in turn does the same with the farmer who does the same with his mortgage company who does the same to their investors who do the same to whoever they spend money with    occasionally one of them takes a cash withdrawal to tip the or stick in a birthday card or buy hot dogs at the ballpark or something but overwhelmingly we are all just spending and re spending promises and the remarkable thing is that overwhelmingly we keep them without anyone involved ever hiring a truck to deliver a of cash to the first person because there is no first person   all of that stuff is absolutely real money*.    i used the example of a wildfire but maybe it will be more useful to think of something that just changes in value for no obvious reason think of some article of clothing that has gone out of everyone was buying that stuff up until the day they stopped somewhere someone was stuck with the last warehouse full of hot pink parachute pants or whatever a month before when they were ordered from china or wherever they were worth $ 50 each now you ca n't give them away that value is gone it 's just vanished the money that bought the pants was real the pants are real but they are no longer worth anything    the person holding that warehouse full of pants now has to pay to either store of dispose of them they might start bouncing checks and breaking promises there was no fraud but there also might not be any way to recover the money owed $ 10 mm worth of parachute pants is now negative $ 1 mm worth of trash that has to be disposed of and mortgage obligations on the warehouse    i hope some of that makes sense it is really hard to explain this stuff via analogy and hypothetical and the kinds of terms that lawyers think in if you will forgive me for saying so

open an investment account on your own and have them roll the old 401 k accounts into either a roth or traditional ira do not leave them in old 401k accounts and definitely do n't roll them into your new employer 's 401k. why well as great as 401 k accounts are there is one thing that employers rarely mention and the 401 k companies actively try to hide     most 401 k plans are loaded with huge fees you wo n't see them on your statements they are often hidden very cleverly with accounting tricks for example in several plans i have participated in the mutual fund symbols may look like the ones you see on the stock tickers but if you read the fine print they only approximate the underlying mutual fund they are named for that is if you multiply the number of shares by the market price you will arrive at a number higher than the one printed on your statement   the spread between those numbers is the fee charged by the 401 k management company and since employees do n't pick that company and ca n't easily fire them they are n't very competitive unless your company is really large and has a tough negotiator in hr if you work for a small company you are probably getting slammed by these fees also they often charge fees for the automatic rebalancing service they offer to do annually to your account to keep your allocation in line with your current contribution allocations   i have no idea why it is legal for them not to disclose these fees on the statements but they do n't i had to do some serious digging to find this out on my own and when i did it was downright scary in one case they were siphoning off over 3 annually from the account using this standard practice however that is not to say that you should n't participate in these plans especially if there is an employer match there are fees with any investment account and the free money your employer is kicking in almost always offsets these fees my point here is just that you should n't keep the money in the 401 k after you leave the company when you have an option to move it to an account with much cheaper fees

you can always reduce the income by the direct expenses required to earn it and figure out whether it is ultimately a net profit or loss    the net profit is taxable income   the loss may be tax deductible if the underlying thing is tax deductible     for the book the $ 50 revenue required a $ 100 expense so that 's a $ 50 net loss   you do n't owe any income tax since it 's a loss   you could take the loss as a tax deduction if you have a business trading books or if buying the book would be tax deductible for some reason   note that in the latter case you can only deduct the $ 50 not the $ 100   for the airline ticket it is to compensate you for the losses you took as a result if the delayed flight so you tally up the $ 22 meal you had in the airport waiting for news the $ 110 on the motel room you rented or forfeited any other way you can peg a cash value to any losses you took   total them up again a net loss is only deductible if the travel is already deductible note that if the actual expenses book flight were tax deductible for some reason the cash back reduces the amount of your tax deduction so it has the same effect as the sale gift being taxable income

yes and no any great idea excluding new technologies discoveries usually involves a trade off good ideas taken to their extremes usually are   i 've generally worked in the open communication environment musk describes for most of my career for 25 years and i 've seen where it works and where it does n't and what musk 's email misses is where it does n't work it is a good starting   for one thing there need to be filters a vp director senior manager ceo or other higher up can not deal with 1000 emails per day for ideas criticisms etc he does mention avoiding chit chat but employees with good ideas for technology or business do not see their suggestions as chit chat most actual good ideas from juniors are too low level for senior management such as different platforms coding methods etc most ideas that senior management are needed like company direction organization etc require a sophisticated knowledge and experience of business contracts etc most of the junior ideas i 've seen including my own were bad ideas that came from lack of experience in business   or take some new hr policy imagine the thousands of direct responses of people straight to hr on the policy that would grind things to a halt the whole purpose of direct managers and supervisors is to filter information down up and sideways so that other people can do their jobs   you do n't want to have high value people knowledge experience spending their day dealing with emails and other people 's ideas you want them providing that value to the business so you need filters people who can recognize the good from the bad and pass on the bad that could be direct managers at the employee 's side or it could be administrative help at the department 's side either way it 's necessary to be efficient   then there 's the problem of including all stakeholders if you are junior and work out a solution to a problem with a junior in another problem but in implementing it you break a whole system which i 've seen happen you 've just caused a lot of harm to the organization neither of you may fully understand the implications of your solution on other things people with responsibility for those things need to be included in the discussion and take responsibility for any implementation   i hate bureaucracy and sometimes it can be a major inefficiency and for getting simple and obvious things done but bureaucracy can also improve efficiency and value and a lack of it can be i 've seen marketing and sales people continually take engineers off of important development work in order to build demos for potential new clients all of which failed to materialize why because the marketing and sales people were chasing leads for contracts without any review of the technical solution the ideal one what the solution to the customer needs really involves what was needed to improve efficiency was a bureaucratic process that reviewed the market opportunities with the technical offerings of the company and either reject opportunities early on or plan and schedule how best to chase the leads   in my experience what works best in most cases is open communication but clear guidelines a on what is appropriate or not to go direct b that the communications are about ideas only and coming up with solutions and c that actions or implementations require bringing the chain of command into the loop for comment or objection before doing anything   complaining to management is n't usually of much value and does n't change much but identifying the problem that is part of the complaint identifying a workable solution with stakeholders and asking for permission via the chain of command is usually a good way to get things done without creating the problems of a free for all

as others have alluded to but have n't said due to the lack of reputation points to spare you can take advantage of oil prices by leveraging up and using as much credit and margin as the banks and brokerages respectively will lend you people assume that the correct answer on this forum has to as conservative financial advice and this is not advice nor conservative futures contracts are readily available but they are expensive to obtain like a minimum entry of $ but if this expense is no such object to you then you can then obtain this contract which is actually worth 20x that and experience the price appreciation and depreciation of the whole contract the concept is similar to a downpayment on a mortgage you assume rock bottom oil prices but fortunately for you futures contracts will allow you to quickly change your bets from future price appreciation and allow you to speculate on future price depreciation so although the union workers will be protesting full time after the drilling company lays them off you will still be getting wealthier long options these are the best the difference with options amongst other speculation products is that options require the least amount of capital risk for the greatest reward with futures or with trading shares of an etf especially on margin you have to put up a lot of capital and if the market does not go your desired direction then will lose a lot and on margin products you can lose more than you put in being long options does not come with these a long march 2015 call option on uso etf can currently be bought for less than $ 200 of actual cash ie the trading quote will be less than $ 2.00 but this will cost you less than $ 200 and will be worth $ 1000 on a very modest rebound in prices the most you can lose is the $ 200 for the contract compared to $ on the futures or $ 100,000 that you do n't have in the futures market if oil really moves against you or compared to whatever large amount of cash needed to actually buy shares of an etf needed to make any decent return these are the most lucrative and fun and and ways to take advantage of rock bottom oil prices as an individual

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

in your scenario i would do the following if in the short term something should happen you can always tap into a line of credit or even a cash advance on the credit card   but you should in no way be paying $ 70 a month in interest    assume you want to pay off the credit card over 12 payments you would need to pay about 450 a month which costs 400 in interest   at the end of the year you have $ 5000 in savings and $ 0 debt the alternative is to pay off the credit card right now and put that $ 450 into savings you would have $ 5400 in savings and $ 0 debt i 'm usually the last to recommend a $ 0 safety net but i make an exception in the case of credit card debt    in the worst case you are no worse off than you are now in the best case you 're up about $ 400 at the end of the year

of course your situation is very at a personal level and i sympathize i just do n't get your point about being driven further into debt it would seem that with a lower credit score you are prevented from taking on more debt that can absolutely be especially to someone who runs a business that relies on short term credit as for why they do this they do it to reduce their risk they do n't want to lend more money they are afraid that you will lose your job and default of course it is not as personal as i am writing it not for you they do n't target you personally they target your credit profile and not for them it is a matter of how the market views the debt and how much they can trade on such debt not what they want to do personally as for the tarp bailouts not releasing enough credit this is reality goverment always thinks it can influence the situation more than it actually can in order to unfreeze credit there needs to be a growing economy that makes the risk look acceptable no amount of goverment will really change that more than marginally by the way legislation like this forcing credit card companies to not raise their rates can lead to credit restrictions by forcing the rates down the risk has to be somewhere so it will be by lowering credit lines or by other means like any price control if you restrict the price it causes shortages intrest rates are the price of credit

typically you can only claim as business deductions those expenses which strictly relate to your business in some cases if you have a dedicated home office in your house you can specify that expenses related to this space furniture etc are business expenses because it is a dedicated space for example i know of someone in sports broadcasting who claimed several tvs as a business expense but these are for a room in his house that he uses only for watching games related to his work responsibilities and never for entertaining having friends over etc i think it will be difficult for you to count any portion of this type of installation as a business expense as it would relate to both your business as well as your residence if you intend to try to get this deducted i would strongly recommend consulting a cpa or tax attorney first i think it will be difficult to prove that the only benefit is to your llc if your electricity bills credits are co with those for your residence best of luck

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

yea i agree with this but i do think that amazon benefits a lot more from   economies of scale than uber both are platform models where you get more profits by having more users however its a lot more difficult to compete with amazon because of their warehouses inventory delivery speed etc etc than it is to compete with uber essentially has no inventory of its own there is a cap to how much uber can charge on either side before it is profitable to enter the market and compete with uber furthermore uber has completely lost countries such as china so there is a limit to their top line also uber still has to fight its never ending stream of litigation and that not just adds risk to the buisness but is a huge cost on uber when it comes down to it besides from the convenience of booking a ride from your phone uber saves money by going around the fact that the drivers in uber do not need taxi licences and that directly cuts into government revenue so far there has nt been too much resistance but it is hard to say if it will remain the case in the future

here is a less scientific view of why there is a focus on credit utilization it is the easiest to control by doing something the focus on utilization is coming from the people asking the questions regarding how to improve their score some even have an obsession with trying to wring a few more points even though they have no immediate need for a loan   look at the other factors that means that for 70 the best advice is either wait for your history to get longer do n't open a new line or do n't close an old line therefore the only thing they control is to get their utilization score down if they pay off balance that saves them interest if they ask for or are award an increase in credit line that also brings down their utilization number if it is the easiest to improve it will garner a greater focus from consumers therefore it seems that the credit industry focuses on it in reality each consumer has to look at their situation to see which part of their overall score they need to focus on

to expand on @joetaxpayer 's answer the devil is actually in the fine print all   the credit card checks that i have ever received in the mail explicitly says that the checks can not be used to pay off   or pay down the balance on any other credit card issued by the same bank whether the card is branded with the bank logo or is branded with a department store or airline logo etc the checks can be used to pay utilities or even taxes without paying the service fee that is charged for using a credit card for such payments the payee is paid the face amount of the check in contrast to charges on a credit card from a merchant who gets to collect only about of the amount on the   charge slip generally speaking balance transfer offers are a bad deal regardless    of whether you pay only the minimum amount due each month or whether    you pay each month 's statement balance in full by the due date or    anything in between the rest of this answer is an explanation in support of the above assertion feel free to tl;dr it if you like if you make only the minimum payment due each month and some parts of the balance that you are carrying has different interest rates applicable than other parts then your payment can be applied to any part of the balance at the bank 's discretion it need hardly be said that the bank invariably chooses to apply it to pay off the lowest rate portion by law card act of 2009 anything above the minimum payment due must be applied to pay off the highest rate part and then the next highest rate part etc but minimum payment or less is at the bank 's discretion as an illustration suppose that you are not using your credit cards any more and are paying down the balances due by making the minimum payment due each month suppose also that you have a balance of $ 1000 carrying 12 apr on card a and pay off the entire balance of $ 500 on card b transferring the amount at 0 apr to card a for which you are billed a 2 fee your next minimum payment   will be likely be $ 35 computed as $ 10 interest on $ 1000 + $ 10 transfer fee + $ 15 1 of balance of $ 1500 if you make only the minimum payment due that payment will go towards paying off the $ 500 and so for next month your balance will be $ 1500 of which $ will be charged 1 interest and $ will be charged 0 interest   in the months   that follow the balance on which you owe 1 interest per month will grow and the 0 balance will shrink   you have to pay more than the minimum amount due to reduce the amount that you owe in this example in the absence of the balance transfer the minimum payment would have been $ 20 = $ 10 interest on $ 1000 at 1 per month + $ 10 1 of balance and would have left you with $ 990 due for next month   to be at the same point with the balance transfer offer you would need to pay $ 30 more than the minimum payment of $ 35 due this extra $ 30 will pay off the interest and transfer fee $ 20 and the rest will be applied to the $ 1000 balance to reduce it to $ 990 there would be no balance transfer fee in future months and so the extra that you need to pay will be a little bit smaller etc if you avoid paying interest charges on credit cards by never taking any cash advances and by paying off the monthly balance   consisting only of purchases made within the past month in full by the due date then the only way to avoid paying interest on the purchases made during the month of the balance transfer offer is to pay off that month 's statement in full including the balance just transferred over and the balance transfer fee by the due date   so depending on when in the billing cycle the transfer occurs you are getting a loan of the balance transfer amount for 25 to 55 days and being charged 2 or 3 for the privilege if you are getting offers of 2 balance transfer fees instead of 3 you are probably among those who pay their balances in full each month and the bank is trying to tempt you into doing a balance transfer by offering a lower fee it is unlikely that they will make a no transfer fee offer they would prefer laughing all the way to themselves by collecting a 2 transfer fee from you and possibly interest too if you fail to read the fine print than having you decline such offers at 3 as being too expensive can you make a balance transfer offer work in your favor sure   do n't make any purchases on the card in the month of the balance transfer or during the entire time that the 0 apr is being offered in the month of the transfer pay the minimum balance due plus the balance transfer fee in succeeding months pay the minimum balance due typically 1 of the balance owed each month all of it will go to reducing the 0 apr balance because that is the only amount owing just before the 0 apr expires anywhere from 6 to 24 months pay off the remaining balance in full   but remember that you are losing the use of this card for this whole period of time put it away in a locked trunk in the attic because using the card to make a purchase will mean paying interest on charges from the day they post something that might be totally alien to you

while there are many very good and detailed answers to this question there is one key term from finance that none of them used and that is net present value while this is a term generally associate with debt and assets it also can be applied to the valuation models of a company 's share price the price of the share of a stock in a company represents the net present value of all future cash flows of that company divided by the total number of shares outstanding this is also the reason behind why the payment of dividends will cause the share price valuation to be less than its valuation if the company did not pay a dividend that those future outflows are factored into the npv calculation actually performed or implied and results in a current valuation that is less than it would have been had that capital been retained unlike with a fixed income security or even a variable rate debenture it is difficult to predict what the future cashflows of a company will be and how investors chose to value things as intangible as brand recognition market penetration and executive competence are often far more subjective that using 10 year libor rates to plug into a present value calculation for a floating rate bond of similar tenor opinion enters into the calculus and this is why you end up having a greater degree of price variance than you see in the fixed income markets you have had situations where companies such as amazon.com google and facebook had highly valued shares before they they ever posted a profit that is because the analysis of the value of their intellectual properties or business models would overtime provide a future value that was equivalent to their stock price at that time

fund rebalancing typically refers to changing the investment mix to stay within the guidelines of the mutual fund objective   for example lets say a fund is supposed to have at least 20 in bonds   because of a dramatic increase in stock price and decrease in bond values it finds itself with only 19.9 in bonds at the end of the trading day   the fund manager would sell sufficient equities to reduce its equity holdings and buy more bonds    rebalancing is not always preferential because it could cause capital gain distribution typically once per year without selling the fund   and really any trading within the fun could do the same in the case you cite the verbiage is confusing   often times i wonder if the author knows less then the reader   it might also be a bit of a rush to get the article out and the author did not write correctly i agree that the etfs cited are suitable for short term traders   however that is because the market has increased in value over the long term   if you bet it will go down over the long term you are almost certain to lose money like you i can not figure out how rebalancing makes this suitable only for short term traders   if the etfs distribute capital gains events much more frequently then once per year that is worth mentioning but does not provide a case for short versus long term traders    secondly i do n't think these funds are doing true rebalancing   they might change investments daily for the most likely profitable outcome but that really is n't rebalancing    it seems the author is confused

the rule that i know is six months of income stored in readily accessible savings e.g. a savings or money market account    others have argued that it should be six months of expenses which is of course easier to achieve   i would recommend against that partially because it is easier to achieve   the other issue is that people are more prone to underestimate their expenses than their income   finally if you base it on your current expenses then budget for savings and have money left over you often increase your expenses   sometimes obviously e.g. a new car and sometimes not e.g. more restaurants or clubs   income increases are rarer and easier to see    either way you can make that six months shorter or longer   six months is both feasible and capable of handling difficult emergencies   six years would n't be feasible   one month would n't get you through a major emergency    examples of emergencies    your savings can be in any of multiple forms   for example someone was talking about buying real estate and renting it   that 's a form of savings but it can be difficult to do withdrawals   stocks and bonds are better but what if your emergency happens when the market is down   part of how emergency funds operate is that they are readily accessible    another issue is that a main goal of savings is to cover retirement   so people put them in tax privileged retirement accounts   the downside of that is that the money is not then available for emergencies without paying penalties   you get benefits from retirement accounts but that 's in exchange for limitations    it 's much easier to spend money than to save it   there are many options and the world makes it easy to do   emergency funds make people really think about that portion of savings   and thinking about saving before spending helps avoid situations where you savings    let 's pretend that retirement accounts do n't exist perhaps they do n't in your country   your savings is some mix of stocks and bonds   you have a mortgaged house   you 've budgeted enough into stocks and bonds to cover retirement   now you have a major emergency    as i understand your proposal you would then take that money out of the stocks and bonds for retirement   but then you no longer have enough for retirement   going forward you will have to scrimp to get back on track    an emergency fund says that you should do that early   because if you 're used to spending any level of money cutting that is painful   but if you 've only ever spent a certain level not increasing it is much easier   the longer you delay optional expenses the less important they seem    beforehand also helps avoid the situation where the emergency happens at the end of your career   it 's one thing to scrimp for fifteen years at fifty   what 's your plan if you would have an emergency at sixty five   or later   then you 're reducing your living standard at retirement    now maybe you save more than necessary   it 's not unknown   but it 's not typical either   it is far more common to encounter someone who is n't saving enough than too much

anthony russell i agree with johnfx petroleum is used in making many things such as asphalt road oil plastic jet fuel etc it 's also used in some forms of electricity generation and some electric cars use gasoline as a backup form of energy petrol is also used in electricity generation outside of cars source can be found here but to answer your question of why shares of electric car companies are not always negatively related to one another deals with supply and demand if investors feel positively about petroleum and petroleum related prospects then they are going to buy or attempt to buy shares of x petrol company this will cause the price of x petrol company to rise ceteris paribus just because the price of petroleum is high does n't mean investors are going to buy shares of an electric car company petrol prices could be high but numerous electric car companies could be doing poorly now with that being said you could argue that sales of electric cars may go up when petrol prices are high but there are numerous factors that come into play here i think it would be a good idea to do some more research if you are planning on investing also remember after a company goes public they no longer set the price of the shares of their stock the price of company x shares are determined by supply and demand which is inherently determined by investors attitudes and expectations ultimately defined by past company performance expectations of future performance earnings etc it could be that when the market is doing well it 's a good sign of other macroeconomic variables employment gdp incomes etc and all these factors power how often individuals travel vacation etc it also has to deal with the economy of the country producing the oil when you have opec countries selling petrol to the u.s. it is likely much cheaper per barrel than domestic produced and refined petrol because of the labor laws etc so a strong economy may be somewhat correlated with oil prices and a strong market but it 's not necessarily the case that strong oil prices drive the economy i think this is a great research topic that can not be answered in one post check this article here from here you can track down what research the fed of cleveland has done concerning this my advice to you is to not believe everything your peers tell you but to research everything your peers tell you with just a few clicks you can figure out the legitimacy of many things to at least some degree

edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of assuming apparently incorrectly that duration is time to maturity first note that the question does not mention the coupon rate the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year   so let 's calculate that consider the cash flow described   you pay out 1015 at the start of year 1 to buy the bond   at the end of years 1 to 5 you receive a coupon payment of x.   also at the end of year 5 you receive the face value of the bond 1000   and you are told that the pay out equals the money received using a time value of money of 4.69 so if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date we have the equation maturity + future value of coupons = future value of bond purchase price 1000 + x 1 + = 1015 ^ 5 solving this for x we obtain   the coupon rate is   you will receive at the end of each of the five years    now we can take this fixed schedule of payments and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above   only now the unknown is the price paid for the bond y. 1000 + 1 + 1 = y ^ 5 solving this equation for y we obtain y =

firstly make sure annual income exceeds annual expenses the difference is what you have available for saving   secondly you should have tiers of savings from most to least liquid and least to most rewarding the core of personal finance is managing the flow of money between these tiers to balance maximizing return on savings with budget constraints for example insurance effectively allows society to move money from savings to stocks and bonds and a savings account lets the bank loan out a bit of your money to people buying assets like homes   note that the above set of accounts is just a template from which you should customize you might want to add in an fsa or hsa extra loan payments or taxable brokerage accounts depending on your cash flow debt and tax situation

the finance functions in spreadsheet software will calculate this for you   the basic functions are for rate payment pv present value fv future value and nper the number of periods   the single calculation faces a couple issues dealing with inflation and with a changing deposit if you plan to save for 30 years and today are saving $ 500/mo for example in ten years i hope the deposits have risen as well i suggest you use a spreadsheet a full sheet to let you adjust for this   last there 's a strange effect that happens precision without accuracy see the results for 30 40 years of compounding today 's deposit given a return of 6 7 up to 10 or so your forecast will be as weak as the variable with the greatest range and there 's more than one return inflation percent you 'll increase deposits all unknown and really unknowable   the best advice i can offer is to save till it hurts plan for the return to be at the lower end of the range and every so often re evaluate where you stand better to turn 40 and see you are on track to retire early than to plan on too high a return and at 60 realize you missed it badly   as far as the spreadsheet goes this is for the google sheets   type this into a cell = it represents 1 interest per month a payment deposit of $ 100 a starting value of $ 0 a goal of $ 1000 and interest added at month end for whatever reason a starting balance must be entered as a negative number for example = will return the number of months to get you from $ 500 to $ 1000 with a $ 100/mo deposit and return someone smarter than i chris comes to mind can explain why the starting balance needs to be entered this way but it does show the correct result as confirmed by my ti ba-35 financial calculator which does n't need $ 500 to be negative

when you buy something with your credit card the store pays a fee to the credit card company typically a base fee of 15 to 50 cents plus 2 to 3 of the purchase at least that 's what it was a few years back when i had a tiny business and i wanted to accept credit cards big chain stores pay less because they are buying in bulk and have negotiating power just because you are n't paying interest does n't mean the credit card company is n't making money off of you in fact if you pay your monthly bill promptly they 're probably making more off of you because they 're collecting 2 or 3 for a month or less instead of the 1 to 2 per month that they can charge in interest the only situation i know where you can get money from a credit card company for free is when they offer convenience checks or a balance transfer with no up front fee i get such an offer every now and then i presume the credit card company does that for the same reason that stores give out free samples they hope that if you try the card you 'll continue using it to them it 's a marketing cost no different than the cost of putting an ad on television

capitalism works best when there is transparency   your secret formula for wealth in the stocks should be based on a fair and free market as sdg said it is your clever interpretation of the facts not the facts themselves   the keyword is fair secrets are useful for manufacturing or production which is only a small part of capitalism   even then we had to devise a system to protect ideas patents trademarks and copyrights because as they succeed in the market their secrecy goes away quickly

this is something you should decide as part of entering a partnership with someone ideally before you make the initial purchase you have a detailed contract written up   if you have already bought the house and someone is now ready to move out the easiest thing to do is sell the house if that is not an option you 'll have to decide on a plan together and then get it in writing

of course there can always be some ways you can integrate some amounts of social responsibility into product but i do n't think that 's the point he 's making social responsibility would be called business best practice if it improved the bottom line it is inevitable that there are times when social responsibility and business goals diverge and at that point given two companies that are in the same market space the one who bets against society will win this is the sort of thing that must be handled in law and absolutely can not be handled by allowing the free market to work because the free market will not discover ethics it will discover that ethics do n't matter in an environment that does n't require them     it 's the reason any claim that business does best when there are no regulations is absolutely false if a company can make more by polluting and you do n't have regulation that says clearly it may cost more but we require you to compete by also being non then you should expect the market to converge on pollution as best practice   removing regulation wo n't allow business to sort this out it will allow business to not care that they are polluting   there is the notion of a b corp that is organized for the purpose of trying to be good guys without being sued but it does n't assure that they will have a fair stake int he market   it just allows them to fail without getting sued by stock holders   basically if everyone is not required to be that level of good guy though b corps are basically indulging unilateral sure they can make a case that ethics matter and that might work but they do n't need b corp protection for that if making the case that ethics matter was going to win in the market any corporation could do it   for more thoughts so i do n't have to drone on here see my articles fiduciary duty vs. the three laws of duty vs three laws of and losing the war in a quiet war in quiet

the translation scheme is detailed in irs publication 15 employer 's tax guide for the 2010 version the information is in section 16 on page 37 there are two ways that employers can calculate the withheld tax amount wage bracket and percentage alternatively they can also use one of the methods defined in irs publication i 'll assume the person making $ 60k yr with 10 allowances is paid monthly $ and married using the wage bracket method the amount withheld for federal taxes would be $ 83 per pay period using the percentage method it would be $ per pay period i do n't recommend that you use this information to determine how to fill out your w-4 the irs provides a special online calculator for that purpose which i have always found quite accurate note allowances are not the same as dependents allowances are a more realistic estimation of your tax deductions taking into consideration much more than just your dependents

your friend probably can not deposit the check to your u.s. bank account u.s. banks that i 've worked with will not accept a deposit from someone who is not an owner of the account i do n't know why not if some stranger wants to make unauthorized deposits to my account why should i object but that 's the common rule   you could endorse the check your friend could then deposit it to his own account or cash it and then transfer the money to you in a variety of ways   but i think it would be easier to just deposit the check in your account wherever it is you live most banks have no problem with depositing a foreign check there may be a fairly long delay before you can get access to the money while the check clears through the system   i do n't know exactly what you mean by a prize check but assuming that this is taxable income yes i assume the u.s. government would want their hard earned share of your money these days you can pay u.s. taxes on line if you have a credit card if you have not already paid u.s. taxes for the year you should make an estimated payment i.e. you ca n't wait until april 15 of the next year you have to pay most or all of the taxes you will owe in the calendar year you earned it

number 3 is n’t as easy as it seems   i interviewed at one place and the manager was and happy   he told me he loved his job and the company   after i was there for 4 months i reminded him of this conversation and asked what he liked about the company   he said he lied to me so i would take the position   i left a few weeks after that but i should have listening to my internal feelings about the company   be sure to look around at the staff and the environment even the people you are not interviewing you   do they look like they are serving time and hope to be released for good behavior   watch their and body language they say a lot     number 5 is very important    i have friends that took jobs that use out of date technology and now they are almost unemployable

apple is currently the most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation and it has issued bonds for instance amazon have also issued bonds in the past as have google one of many reasons companies may issue bonds is to reduce their tax bill if a company is a multinational it may have foreign earnings that would incur a tax bill if they were transferred to the holding company 's jurisdiction the company can however issue bonds backed by the foreign cash pile it can then use the bond cash to pay dividends to shareholders ratings agencies such as moody 's fitch and standard poor 's exist to rate companies ability to make repayments on debt they issue investors can read their reports to help make a determination as to whether to invest in bond issues of course investors also need to determine whether they believe the ratings agencies
