you can move money in and out of the business at will just keep track of every transaction ideally you 'd use an accounting software like quickbooks or similar create a capital contributions account and every time you put money into the business checking account record it as a capital contribution likewise if you take money out of the business it comes from your capital accounts you can create a separate capital distributions account in your accounting software or just use a single account for contributions and distributions money coming in and out of those capital accounts is not taxable because you will pay taxes based on net earnings regardless of whether or not you have distributed any profits so there 's no need to make a loan to the company which would have tax consequences to reimburse yourself for purchases already made submit an expense report to the company if the company is unfunded right now you can make a capital contribution to cover current expenses submit the expense report and wait until you have some profits before paying out the expense report or making any distributions welcome to entrepreneurship

it 's not quite identical due to fees stock rights and reporting tax obligations   but the primary difference is that a person could have voting rights in a company while maintaining zero economic exposure to the company sometimes known as empty voting as an abstract matter it 's identical in that you reduce your financial exposure whether you sell your stock or short it   so the essence of your question is fundamentally true   but the details make it different   of course there are fee differences in how your broker will handle it and also margin requirements for shorting   somebody playing games with overlapping features of ownership sales and purchases may have tax and reporting obligations for straddles wash sales and related issues   a straight sale is generally less complicated for tax reporting purposes and a loss is more likely to be respected than someone playing games with sales and purchases but the empty voting issue is an important difference   you could buy stock with rights such as voting engage in other behavior such as forwards shorts or options to negate your economic exposure to the stock while maintaining the right to vote   of course in some cases this may have to be disclosed or may be covered by contract and most people engaging in stock trades are unlikely to have meaningful voting power in a public company   but the principle is still there as explained in the article by henry and bernie black hedge funds have been especially creative in voting rights from economic ownership sometimes they hold more votes than economic ownership a pattern we call empty voting in an extreme situation a vote holder can have a negative economic interest and thus an incentive to vote in ways that reduce the company 's share price sometimes investors hold more economic ownership than votes though often with voting rights the de facto ability to acquire the votes if needed we call this situation hidden ownership because the economic ownership and de facto voting ownership are often not disclosed

value investing is an investment approach that relies on buying securities below their intrinsic values there are two main concepts one is the intrinsic value and the other is margin of safety   intrinsic value is the value of the underlying business if we are talking about stocks that can be calculated through carefully analyzing the business looking at all aspects of it if there is an intrinsic value exists for a company then there is a price tag we can put on its shares as well value investing is looking to buy shares well below its intrinsic value   it is important to know that there is no correct intrinsic value exists for a company and two people can come up with different figures if they were presented the same data calculating the intrinsic value for a business is the hardest part of value investing   margin of safety is the difference between the buying price of a stock and its intrinsic value value investors are insisting on buying stocks well below their intrinsic value where the margin of safety is or even more this concepts is protecting them from poor decisions and market downturns it is also providing a room for error when calculating the intrinsic value   the approach was introduced by benjamin graham and david dodd in a book called security analysis in 1934 other famous investor using this approach is warren buffet books to read   i would start to read the first two book first

there are quite some options but without additional information i can only provide examples last year i had the option to buy a house but i decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price but if i had bought a house my mother would have lent me the money with me paying it back to her over the years on 3 interest so it would have been some kind of a private loan but my mom would never have taken ownership of the house since it was not her intention to own it in any way does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you if yes and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying then this is an option the second option the one we discarded because of the additional cost is that i could have taken a loan paying 4.5 interest to the bank which would then pay under 1 to my mom and keep the rest banks always want to make profit and this profit has to come from somewhere from the difference between the interest rates if your dad has 230k on the bank and you owe 230k to the bank you are better off if you keep the bank out at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money and you are comfortable with owing him money my gf would never money from her mother because her mother would always play the you are in my debt card on each and every visit and whenever she needed help in any way so the key is what does your dad feel comfy with and what do you feel comfy with if possible keep the banks out but set up a written contract between you and your dad

you say you want a more stable system recall from your introductory economics courses that money has three roles a medium of exchange here is $ give me goods a unit of account you owe me $ the business made $ last year and a store of value i have saved $ for the future i assume that you are mostly concerned with the store of value role being eroded due to inflation but first consider that most people still want regular currency so as a medium of exchange or accounting unit anything would face an uphill battle if you discard that role for your currency and only want to store value with it you could just buy equities and commodities and baskets of currencies and debt in a brokerage account possibly using mutual funds to store your value trillions of dollars worth of business takes place this way every year already virtual currency was a bit of a dot com bubble thing the systems which did n't go completely bust and are still around have been by money laundering and otherwise remain largely an ignored niche an online fiat currency has the same basic problem that another currency has you need to trust the central bank not to create more money and cause inflation or even just with the funds or go bankrupt get sued perhaps the federal reserve may be jerking us around on that front right now they 're still a lot more believable than a small private institution some banks might possibly be trustworthy enough to launch a currency but it 's hard to see why they 'd bother it ca n't be a big profit center because people are n't willing to pay too much to just use money and an online currency that 's backed by commodities e.g. gold is going to be subject to potentially violent swings in the prices of commodities imagine getting a loan out for your house denominated in terms of e gold and then the price of gold ouch

so my question is this in reality is investment in equities like the    stock market even remotely resemble the type of growth one would    expect if investing the same money in an account with compounding    interest generally no as there is a great deal of volatility when it comes to investing in stocks that is n't well represented by simply taking the compounded annual growth rate and assuming things always went up and never went down this is adding in the swings that the market will take that at times may be a bit of a rude surprise to some people are all these vastly underestimating how much savers    need to be socking away by overstating what is realistic in terms of    growth in investment markets possibly but not probably until we know definitively what the returns are from various asset classes i 'm not sure i 'd want to claim that people need to save a ton more i 'll agree that the model misses how wide the swings are not necessarily that the averages are too low or overstated

my wife and i meet in the first few days of each month to create a budget for the coming month during that meeting we reconcile any spending for the previous month and make sure the amount money in our accounts matches the amount of money in our budget record to the penny we use an excel spreadsheet how you track it matters less than the need to track it and see how much you spent in each category during the previous month   after we have have reviewed the previous month 's spending we allocate money we made during that previous month to each of the categories what categories you track and how granular you are is less important than regularly seeing how much you spend so that you can evaluate whether your spending is really matching your priorities we keep a running total for each category so if we go over on groceries one month then the following month we have to add more to bring the category back to black as well as enough for our anticipated needs in the coming month if there is one category that we are consistently underestimating or overestimating we talk about why if there are large purchases that we are planning in the coming month or even in a few months we talk about them why we want them and we talk about how much we 're planning to spend if we want a new tv or to go on a trip we may start adding money to the category with no plans to spend in the coming month the biggest benefit to this process has been that we do n't make a lot of impulse purchases or if we do they are for small dollar amounts the simple need to explain what i want and why means i have to put the thought into it myself and i talk myself out of a lot of purchases during that train of thought the time spent regularly evaluating what we get for our money has cut waste that was n't really bringing much happiness we still buy what we want but we agree that we want it first

personally i would a consider selling the car and replacing it with a cheaper one   if you only drive it once a month you are probably not getting much value from owning a nice car b move the car either current or replacement out to your parent 's place   the cost of a plane ticket is about the same as the cost of the garage and your parents would likely hold on to it for free assuming they live in the suburbs and parking is not an issue option b should lower your insurance costs very low annual mileage and at least you 'll get some frequent flier miles out of your $ 350 a month that being said this is a quality of life issue which means that there is n't going to be a firm answer    if you are 25 have little debt which you are paying off on time have an emergency fund and you are making regular contributions to your 401k you are certainly not being seriously irresponsible by owning a nice car   but you may decide that the $ 1000 a month could be better spent somewhere else

there 's no need for an index to have a currency as its purpose is not to act as an asset but rather to signal investors about the performance of a collection of stocks an index can be price weighted meaning that its value equals the arithmetic average of the prices of each stock in the index with no stock splits the return on this index is the same as the return on a portfolio composed of one share of each stock if there is a stock split however instead of dividing by the number of stocks as you normally would when taking the arithmetic average you divide it by the number that will make the value of the index pre stock split arithmetic average equal to the value post stock split then use that dividing number for all periods until a new stock split occurs   an index can be value weighted meaning that its changes in value track the percentage changes in total market capitalization of the stocks in the index price weighted indexes ignore for firm size and percentage changes in price weighted indexes are not robust to stock splits value weighted indexes take firm size into account and are robust to stock splits djia is price weighted s&p 500 is value weighted

it 's not so much pros and cons as much as it is what are your savings goals while it 's best to start early to save money for retirement you may have numerous short- to medium term savings goals school down payment etc here 's a template you can consider i would suggest that you open up an rrsp mutual fund or brokerage account and invest a certain amount that you feel free locking up for the next few decades and investing it in some sort of growth product perhaps look at portfolios using the couch potato strategy then also open up a tfsa mutual fund or brokerage account and use it to invest for medium term goals i.e. 5 10 years invest in products that will allow for some growth but with low chance of losing principle in that time frame what i would n't do is open up a tfsa savings account and use it for day to day savings the tax you save is negligible and you would need to keep track of deposits and withdrawals to ensure that you do n't for the tax year similarly an rrsp savings account or gic is far too conservative at your age imho think of rrsp and tfsa as investment vehicles rather than accounts per se either type allows for you to invest in a vast array of products including mutual funds equities some derivatives gold bonds gics etc   to conclude my view is to use rrsp to invest for conventional retirement goals and use the tfsa to invest for medium term and early retirement goals

they could have different quotes as there are more than a few pieces here   are you talking a real time level ii quote or just a delayed quote   delayed quotes could vary as different companies would be using different time points in their data   you are n't specifying exactly what kind of quote from which system are you using here the key to this question is how much of a answer do you want and how prepared are you to pay for that kind of access to the automated trades happening   remember that there could well be more than a few trades happening each millisecond and thus latency is something to be very careful here regardless of the exchange as long as we are talking about first world stock exchanges where there are various automated systems being used for trading different market makers is just a possible piece of the equation here   one could have the same market maker but if the are different e.g if one quote is at and the other is at there could be a difference given all the trades processed within that second thus the question is how well can you get that split second total view of bids and asks for a stock   you want to get all the outstanding orders which could be a non trivial task

first let me mention that the reasons mentioned this far for renting are excellent ones but i disagree second i would like to mention that i 'm just a regular joe not an accountant or a realtor that said i was in a similar situation not that long ago i ended up renting but i wish i had n't you should check out the offers in your area you seem like you 're willing to compromise on a more standard or older home if that is the case and you are willing to settle for an older town home or something similar it might be in your best interest to do so   in my area for instance the urban areas are becoming a bit crowded this is good news for the people who already own homes in those urban areas but bad news for people who are looking to rent an apartment which tend to be located in urban areas or buy a house in these urban areas the reason i say that is simple there is only one thing there will never be more of land if people are moving into these areas and there is limited room to build structures the demand is going up while the supply is unable to keep up this means an increase in prices but this can also be used to your advantage   as the demand for those urban areas goes up the rural areas around the urban areas are likely to be subsidized for instance near me if you 're willing to be 20 minutes from the nearest walmart and you have a 550 + credit score and a stable income you 're able to acquire a government subsidized loan with 0 down i would recommend dropping at least something however if possible apartments of the size your family is going to require are going to be expensive people who own apartment buildings are looking to make the most money per square foot this means most apartment complexes are going to be filled with 1 2 bedroom apartments but have very few if any 3 + bedroom apartments again this is my general experience but it may be different where you 're living   i suspect the apartment your family is going to need is going to end up being very expensive especially if people are moving into your town you might consider trying to get a lower quality house as to a rare and large apartment for a few pretty obvious reasons do n't misunderstand me though a lot of people get with the idea of being a home owner and end up getting into something they will never be able to maintain and if that happens it 's something that 's going to follow you for the rest of your life   as for your student loans if you need to and you qualify you can apply for hardship this would mean that you do n't have to pay anything or pay a reduced rate for some arbitrary approved amount of time or until some arbitrary circumstance is met however do not take this lightly while doing this might not necessarily accrue interest depending on whether or not your loans were subsidized or unsubsidized and a host of other factors it might actually halt interest these loans will follow you even into bankruptcy meaning if you get your student loans postponed and end up losing the house anyway you have to make a fresh start with a bankruptcy and student loans on your back   furthermore you ca n't count your chickens before they and neither will the banks a big part of qualifying for a loan is your proof of income if you have n't had that steady job for 6 months to a year or more you 're going to have a tough time getting a loan suppose your wife to be does start making that income it 's still not going to make a difference to the banks until they can say that it 's not just a month long   last after reading all this i want to tell you that i am bias i happened to miss the opportunity i 'm explaining to you now and that affects what i think you should do in this situation weigh the options carefully and objectively talk to your fiance talk to your friends parents anyone who is close with you come to an educated decision rather than the decision that might be more exciting or the one you wish you could take   good luck

in maryland a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit   the interest is simple interest it does not compound the interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years   before october 1 2004 the rate was 4   until january 1 2015 the rate was 3   currently the rate is 1.5 or the simple interest rate accrued at the daily u.s. treasury yield curve rate for one year as of the first business day of each year whichever is greater   this year the rate is 1.5   maryland 's department of housing and community development has a security deposit calculator for easy calculation of this interest however it only works for deposits since january 1 2015 it is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made or if the rate changes over the years    at most if you get 4 interest every year i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 43   the interest is accrued every 6 months so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your year with the new law that took effect this year interest is accrued monthly at least if the interest rate changes with the new laws i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 + $ 158 3 + $ 158 1.5 0.5 some text on the security deposit calculator suggests that the laws for prince george 's county are different than the rest of the state   if you are in that county you 'll need to check the local ordinances to see what security deposit policies apply

most other countries are worse off     your perception of what is a resource intensive lifestyle does not take into consideration future innovation or     government debt is large but not insurmountable   much of it is owned by the government itself social security trust fund and the federal reserve and by domestic banks    the crumbling infrastructure claim is often made but is rarely well so it 's hard to respond to     entitlements is a bit more complicated an issue due to political gridlock but i expect that at least minor changes will be made gradually that will help deal with this problem   if not major reform small things like pushing back the benefit age a year here and a year there repealing benefits for the wealthy reducing the size of cost of living adjustments reducing the amount that is paid out to higher earning recipients increasing the amount of yearly income that is subject to fica   these are piecemeal changes that both sides could agree to even in the current political climate   medicare is the bigger cost but how to deal with that is difficult to determine considering what 's going on with obamacare   municipal and state governments will not fail if they go bankrupt   most municipalities and states are able to balance a budget   it can be done but in some place it is n't because politicians do n't have enough backbone to say no   when they go bankrupt and are unable to borrow money they will have no choice and can blame their cuts on the banks who wo n't loan them money   that is unless the people running the federal government also have no backbone and decide to bail them out in which case we will have an enormous case of moral hazard on our hands   the economic dominoes in europe and china are not damaging the core of their economies   unless europe breaks apart violently and goes to war with itself or china has a civil war the basic aspects of their economy that make them a valuable part of the global economy will not go away   their productive capacities will remain intact and we 'll still want to buy stuff from each other     the beauty of free market capitalism is that it 's so adaptable and the fact that things are changing does not mean that everyone will be worse off   whether or not the us is above everyone else in the end is mostly irrelevant but the fundamental aspects of the us economy that make it among the strongest in the world will not change because of these things   our workforce will remain highly educated very productive and very innovative   we have the best farmland in the world and a lot of it enormous amounts of natural resources a relatively flexible and adaptable economy and a tremendous amount of wealth   there may be troubles related to certain institutions and governing bodies but remember that those things are not the economy   the economy is the people the things they can make the things they know and the things that they can do

yes you should take in the expenses being incurred by the mutual fund this   lists down the fees charged by the mutual fund and where expenses can be found in the annual statement of the fund to calculate fees and expenses as you might expect fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a low cost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time you do n't pay expenses so the money is taken from the assets of the fund so you pay it indirectly if the expenses are huge that may point to something i.e. fund managers are enjoying at your expense money is being used somewhere else rather than being paid as dividends if the expenses are used in the growth of the fund that is a positive sign else you can expect the fund to be downgraded or upgraded by the credit rating agencies depending on how the credit rating agencies see the expenses of the fund and other factors generally comparison should be done with funds invested in the same sectors same distribution of assets so that you have a homogeneous comparison to make else it would be unwise to compare between a fund invested in oil companies and other in computers yes the economy is inter but that is not how a comparison should be done

hope this helps   i understand that a reverse mortgage can be paid out in two ways a lump sum and monthly payments i figure that if you take the lump sum eventually the bank wants you to start paying it back answer    actually there are 3 payout options or 4 if you consider a combination payout as another one there 's a lump sum a line of credit or the monthly payout or a combination   i figure that if you take the monthly payments eventually the bank stops paying out and wants you to pay it back in both situations interest accrues and this is how the bank makes money off of the deal   answer the only time the monthly payments would stop would be if the borrower defaults on the lenders terms or they no longer live at home you are right though and interest does accrue on whichever payment is decided on i 'm not sure how the lender makes money probably by the interest but i know borrowers are protected against high rates and owing more than your house here 's an article i found that goes over the protections more in detail   but what determines when you have to begin paying back the reverse mortgage some sources online seem to say that it 's based only on if you die or would like to sell move that ca n't be right in all situations because you could end up with a massive debt on a property more than its value   answer there are a lot of protections or regulations in place to protect anyone who takes out a reverse mortgage one being you ca n't owe more than your house is valued at during the time of repayment a reverse mortgage is a non recourse loan in the instance that your house is less than you owe you either sell the home and the proceeds are used to pay the loan and you keep the rest or if you owe more than the house proceeds of the home go to the lender either way you 're not left paying for a mortgage without the house in the case the parent grandparent passes then the heirs would have a choice of either paying back the reverse mortgage in payments or they can sell the house heirs are protected during this as well to make sure they 're not left with major debt in case of anything   is there a formula to figure out when the bank stops the monthly payments and then wants it back   amount becomes due if loan terms are not met but the lender will discuss the options if it comes to that   is there a different formula for when the lump sum would have to be paid back   answer each payout option has the same terms and the same pay back terms as long as terms are met the lender ca n't ask for early repayment

if the stock has low liquidity yes there could be times when there are no buyers or sellers at a specific price so if you put a limit order to buy or sell at a price with no other corresponding sellers or buyers then your order may take a while to get executed or it may not be executed at all you can usually tell if a stock has low liquidity by the small size of the average daily volume the lack of order depth and the large size of the gap between bids and offers so if a stock for example has last sale price of $ 0.50 has a highest bid price of $ 0.40 and a lowest offer price of $ and an average daily volume of 10000 share it is likely to be very illiquid so if you try to buy or sell at around the $ 0.50 mark it might take you a long time to buy or sell this stock at this price

i would not call this a good idea but i would n't necessarily call it a bad idea either before you even consider it you need to do a little bit of soul searching if there is any chance that having multiple credit cards could entice you to spend more than you otherwise would then this is definitely a bad idea avoiding temptation is the key to preventing actions in all aspects of life aside let 's take a mathematical approach to the question i believe your conclusion is correct if you add some to it a few years from now then your credit score will probably be higher than if you just had 1    credit card here are some other things to consider and saving the best for last as for the hard inquiries they should only have an effect on your credit score for 1 year though they can be seen on your report for 2 years final thought if you decide to do this and i personally do n't recommend it i would keep the number of applications smaller 3 5 instead of 10 15 i also would only choose cards that have no annual fee try to choose 1 card that has 1 2 cash back and make that your regular card

your analysis is wrong for a few reasons one the consolidated margins of nflx are being weighed on by international expansion us ebit margins were 24 in 2016 and even that is an underestimating of steady state margin profile because nflx runs a subscription model where is paid up front us marketing was 7 of us streaming revenue in 2016 so in a mature sub replacement growth profile you could easily see that coming down to 4 5 accretion that delta to the us ebit margin leaving you around 26 27 margins state international margins should be higher because in local markets netflix only wants to have 20 of the content library be local with the remainder leveraged from the us library    have n't read the bernstein report but i think you misunderstood it the point was that the analyst calculated net customer ltv and valued the company based on that times his sub estimate the value additive part of the note is the ltv calc which i have n't seen but i imagine is probably based on the above margin analysis and some churn assumptions

first bear in mind that you 're talking about having an average of saved up at any given time if you spend all your stipend every quarter at a steady rate you 'll start out with all of it and have none left at the end of the quarter along with any long term savings you manage to build up over time in today 's low interest rate environment of ~1 interest rates we 're talking about approximately £ interest so it 's not worth a huge amount of effort to this you mentioned a bonus but looking at the charter savings website i do n't actually see one listed for either the cash isa or the savings accounts you mention in general banks in the uk actually use bonus rates as a short term measure to suck in new customers and the bonuses typically expire after a while leaving you with a worse rate also i do n't think either of the rates you mention is guaranteed they are both listed as variable in reality i doubt they will go down too much more given that the likely next move in uk interest rates is upwards the typical main advantage of an isa is its tax free nature but from your question i assume you do n't have any other income so you wo n't need to pay tax on any interest you earn outside an isa either also given that your budget is quite tight and you expect to spend most or all of your stipend there 's no advantage to using an account where you can build up long term tax free savings even if you do have a few thousand pounds left over by the end of your phd you 'll easily be able to put those into an isa at that point given the annual limit of £ 20k. you 're right not to want to take any risks with the money and there are n't really any risk free investments other than savings accounts available at least on the you 're talking about so overall i 'd just go for the return edit as 's answer points out you will probably be able to find a loss leader current account that actually offers more interest than a savings account you 'll need to either use a single current account and manage your budgeting carefully or use a second current account as your savings account and make sure to set things up to satisfy the requirements of the account you choose such as incoming payments or outgoing direct debits

the problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow if we want to apply this approach to short selling we should look at the trade from another perspective we buy money and pay for this money with stock our investment to buy 50 $ in your example is 1 share   when closing the short position we effectively sell back our money 50 $ and receive 2 shares our profit on this position is obviously 1 share setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100    in reality we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share this is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit

then you should not enjoy the benefits by being in a union then right   that seems simple enough but that 's not how it works    unions by law have the duty of fair so even if you are not a member you still are awarded all the benefits and protections of the contract    so it 's not that simple because how do you balance that if not for fair share   the union still has to pay to protect you but you do n't have to pay for any of the work they do   so then if you can get all the benefits of being in the union and not pay a dime for it why would you   seems logical right it 's a good deal we all want to save money    well as everyone stops paying and the union ca n't afford to operate as it did like any organization it and lays off staff   now the union no longer has the resources to offer you good representation which causes the dues paying members to be frustrated and to drop out and or ditch the union entirely   now no one in your workplace has a voice a contract or any protections    that may turn out to be great   but you know the company wants to save money too    the company is also no longer obligated to offer you the same wages or benefits that your coworkers negotiated   so now the company is free to cut wages benefits and workforce to improve thier bottom line or executive bonuses

well it would appear that you had a wash sale that canceled out a loss position   without seeing the entire report i could n't tell you exactly what was happening or how you triggered 1091   but just from the images it appears as though your purchase of stock was layered into multiple tranches perhaps you acquired more of the stock in the period than you sold possibly because of a prior holding    if in the period around the sale of stock 30 days before and 30 days after you also acquire the same stock including by contract or option then it out your loss   if you held your stock for a while then in a period bought more and sold some then any loss would be washed out by the acquisition   of course it is also a wash sale if your purchase of the stock follows your sale rather than it   your disallowed loss goes into the basis of your stock holding so will be meaningful when you do have a true economic sale of that stock from irs pub 550 a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you buy substantially identical stock or securities acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities or acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account ira or roth ira if you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock you also have a wash sale looking at your account images we can see a number of positions sold at a loss sale proceeds less than basis but each one is adjusted to a zero loss   i suspect the fuller picture of your account history and portfolio will show a more complicated and longer history with this particular stock   that is likely the source of the wash sale disallowed loss you might be able to confirm that all the added numbers are appearing in your current basis in this stock or were reflected upon your final exit from the stock

the owner of a long futures contract does not receive dividends hence this is a disadvantage compared to owning the underlying stock if the dividend is increased and the future price would not change there is an arbitrage possibility for the sake of simplicity assume that the stock suddenly starts paying a dividend and that the risk free rate is zero so interest does not play a role one can expect that the future price is equal to the stock price before the dividend if the future price would not change an investor could buy the stock and short a futures contract on the stock at expiration he has to deliver the stock for the price set in the contract which is under the assumptions here equal to the price he bought the stock for but because he owned the stock he receives the announced dividend hence he can make a risk free profit consisting of the if interest do play a role the argument is similar

my general rule of thumb with start ups is do n't quit your day job until you can afford to quit your day job if you were a single man or your wife also could provide income for the family then you would have more flexibility but if you are the single income provider i suggest a more cautious route it may be frustrating to deal with the of work but if you really want to see that start up i would suggest getting started to work on it with what you can while working at your other job until you have enough money saved and enough work done that you can fully launch the start up full time it will be a lot of work so would a start up but it is less risky especially considering your family situation if you really hate what you are doing i would suggest looking for other opportunities in your field of work maybe there is something that you have overlooked and do n't hesitate to apply for jobs you are not sure if you are qualified as long as it does n't involve time away from your current job an application is fairly painless and the worst case is you keep doing what you are still doing

you have no idea where interest rates will go   a year or two ago people thought 3 was absurdly low why buy them   and then interest rates dropped even further so the people who bought then got more interest and the present value went up since then   if you 'd done nothing you would have lost money   now rates are really absurdly low   what do   well they could drop even more   it 's possible   we could also have 20 years of see japan   sitting on your hands loses money   what else should you do   put your money in risky equities   a lot of people these days are buying dividend paying stocks now   it 's extremely foolhardy to treat stocks as fixed income because they are very far from it   yourself and taking on too equity risk imo is far more risky than accepting low interest rate risk   finally i do n't exactly use bonds to make money i use it as a safe haven while i wait for stocks to do something   stocks go up i sell some and buy bonds   bonds go up i sell them and buy more stock   it 's nice to get a little interest on the side but not critical   i could use cash or but i 'm comfortable with the amount of risk return that 5 bonds provide

no the more conservative approach is to use the market value of debt at least assuming its trading at a discount a company would n't necessarily have to come to an agreement with creditors they would just default on their obligations in which case the company may file for bankruptcy protection which allows for a variety of scenarios to play out both consensual and not    as for when debt trades at a premium we 're talking about two different factors that effect bond prices credit risk and interest rate risk but yes a company does have a higher financial obligation if interest rates decline they 're stuck paying 8 in an environment where they could refinance for 6 if they refinance then creditors more than likely are n't going to take less than par if they do n't refinance then they have the opportunity cost of essentially overpaying on their cost of debt

i certainly do not agree and you are making some sweeping statements without backing them up what i am saying is that a company can not make a promise of credit to an employee without having something to back that up if you do n't have that then you can not offer pensions or other futures that you can not ensure are going to be properly funded no one forces a company to offer pensions in this day and age there are exceptions of course so they do not need to offer it at all    things like pensions are often used as incentives that can be provided in lieu of cash payments to the employee if we are going to make cash like exchanges of value then that value should be just as guaranteed as it is when the company promises to pay back a loan    in short you should not be able to hire employees on a financial promise you can not keep in good faith if for some reason you can not keep that promise just like with standard credit it should hurt you    or you know as a company do n't make bs promises and just pay people what they are worth

investopedia has this note where you 'd want the point the interest rate commonly about by the media has a wide and    varied impact upon the economy when it is raised the general effect    is a lessening of the amount of money in circulation which works to    keep inflation low it also makes borrowing money more expensive    which affects how consumers and businesses spend their money this    increases expenses for companies lowering earnings somewhat for those    with debt to pay finally it tends to make the stock market a    slightly less attractive place to investment as for evidence i 'd question that anyone could really take out all the other possible economic influences to prove a direct co relation between the federal funds rate and the stock market returns   for example of the dozens of indices that are stock related which ones would you want that evidence total market large cap small cap value stocks growth stocks tech utilities reits etc   this is without considering other possible investment choices such as direct real estate holdings compared to reits that is precious metals and collectibles that could also be used

transaction fees are part of the income for banks and as we know they are profit making corporations just like any other company the is that instead of buying and packing and selling groceries they buy and package and sell money within the rules and the market they will try to maximize their profit exactly like apple or gm or walmart and so on sweden and are part of the european union and the leaders of the union has defined by law that certain types of transactions should be done without fees in order to transfer money from your swedish account to the dutch account you do what is called a sepa transaction which should be done in one day without cost to you as a customer reference

see publication 505 specifically the section on annualized income installment method which says if you do not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a repair shop you operate is much larger in the summer than it is during the rest of the year your required estimated tax payment for one or more periods may be less than the amount figured using the regular installment method the publication includes a worksheet and explanation of how to calculate the estimated tax due for each period when you have unequal income   if you had no freelance income during a period you should n't owe any estimated tax for that period however the process for calculating the estimated tax using this method is a good bit more complex and confusing than using the short method in which you just estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and divide it into four equal pieces   therefore in future years you might want to still use the equal payments method if you can swing it   it 's too late for this year since you missed the april deadline for the first payment   if you can estimate the total amount of freelance income you 'll receive even though you might not be able to estimate when you 'll receive it you can probably still use the simpler method   if you really have no idea how much money you 'll make over the year you could either use the more complex computation or you could use a very high estimate to ensure you pay enough tax and you 'll get a refund if you pay too much

in this situation i would recommend figuring out about what you would need to pay in taxes for the year   you have two figures your salary and dependents but not others   will you contribute to a 401 k do you itemize deductions etc   if things are uncertain i would figure my taxes as if i took the standard deduction    for argument 's sake let 's assume that comes out to $   i would then add $ 500 on to my total to cover potential increases in taxes fees   you can adjust this up or down based on your ability to absorb having to pay or the uncertainty in your first so now $ divide by 26 the amount of paychecks you receive in a year = $ 300 then i would utilize a payroll calculator to adjust my exemptions and additional witholding so my federal withholding is as close as possible to this number    or you can sit with your payroll department and do the same

the difference is that for the one year time frame the data is represented based on daily data and the sma is 20 days whilst for the 5 year timeframe the data is automatically represented as weekly data with the sma represented by 20 weeks not 20 days anymore this happens due to daily data on this chart being too much data to represent over a 5 year period so the data defaults to weekly data over such a long period if the chart is represented as weekly data then any indicators will also have to be represented in weekly data if you use a more sophisticated charting program you can actually select to see daily or weekly data over longer periods such as 5 years or more

a large number of bond holders decide to sell their bonds   if they all decide to do this at the same time then there will be a large supply of bonds being sold in the market   this will drive down the price of the bonds which will increase yields why do bond yields move inversely to bond prices you purchase a $ 100 bond today that yields 5   you spent $ 100   the very next day the same bonds are being sold with a yield of 10   if you wanted to sell your bond to someone you would have to sell it so it competed with the new bonds being sold   you could not sell it for $ 100 which is what you paid for it   you would have to sell it for less than the $ 100 you paid for it in order for it to have the equivalent yield of the new bonds being sold with a 10 yield   this is why bond yields move inversely to bond prices why does rising yields increase the cost of borrowing if someone is trying to sell new bonds they will have to sell bonds that compete with the yields of the current bonds already in the market if yields are rising on the existing bonds then the issuer of the new bonds will have to pay higher interest rates to offer equivalent yields on the new bonds the issuer is now paying more in interest making it more expensive to borrow money what are the incentives for the bond to sell his her bonds one reason a bond holder will sell his her bonds is they believe inflation will outpace the yield on the bond they are holding   if a bond yields 3 and inflation is at 5 then the bond holder is essentially losing purchasing power if they continue to hold onto the bond   another reason to sell would be if the bond holder has doubts in the ability of the issuer to repay the interest and/or principal of the bond

parts of what you want are possible but taken as a whole you 're out of luck first of all there is no master database of every cardholder in the country   the only way to check if information is correct is to ask the issuing bank   the avs system is a way to automate doing so but it 's possible to call the bank directly and verbally verify the address    that means you 're subject to the whims of what the issuing bank chooses to support   banks that are part of the visa and mastercard networks generally only verify the numeric parts address apartment number   amex can also verify the cardholder name   but if the bank does n't have support for validating something you ca n't validate it separately there is a verify only transaction which some processors support which will do exactly what you want   return avs values without ever charging the card   however processors require you to have the approved merchant account you do n't want to have to have   without being a merchant you should n't have access to other people 's credit cards anyway   would you really want anyone in the country to be able to verify anyone else 's address whenever they want in short whatever purpose you have for wanting this probably falls into one of three categories

how do i determine what to pay the person you pay them either what you believe the work is worth to have done for you vs doing it yourself or how much they ask for after negotiation there 's no rule of thumb because it 's driven by the market   there will always be people who are willing and able to do the work for less than you but ca n't always get work which is the reason they are charging less just as there will always be people who charge much more than you and have to turn work away you are at a comfortable medium where you have enough work to charge a moderate rate and can amplify your reputation network client by the work out as an example if i charge $ to do engineering work but i want to subcontract it out then i have to take into account that so let 's say i have a contract for 20 hours of work at $ $ 2,400 and i figure that i can subcontract out all of it   however it 's going to cost me about 4 hours of work to review their 20 hours of work deal with administrative overhead interpret and pass along requirements etc so if i work 4 hours then the maximum i can pay the contractor for 20 hours of work is the remaining 16 hours x $ 120 the contractor would be doing 20 hours for $ to break even on cash and i only make worth of profit for 4 hours worth of work   that 's actually a net loss unless you can already fill those other 16 hours with paying work i do n't think that would be worth it but if the contractor only required $ then you 're paying him $ 1,200 for 20 hours of work and you get to keep $ 1,200 for only 4 hours of your time   the subcontractor has turned your $ rate into $ now you still only net $ 1,200 rather than the full $ 2,400 so your revenue is down but if you can find work for that other 16 hours at your normal rate then you 're still ahead   alternately you might find that working only 12 hours a week is a fine way to live and choose to forgo that revenue for personal time the costs and break even point vary greatly from situation to situation but hopefully this gives you a framework to evaluate the decision for yourself

the debt on credit cards is pretty high its in the range of 30 40 apr there could also be a case very high personal loan for medical or other personal emergencies at a rate in excess of 15 the debt consolidation would offer this at a very low apr there are institutions that offer debt consolidation services that would consolidate all your debt into a single loan at a lower rate of interest they would also negotiate with all your lenders to waive charges and accrued interests to the max extent the benefit to the institution offering this service is that they have a larger loan on books and hence the servicing cost is less most of the time the debt consolidation is offered with some asset as the guarantee for the new loan by doing this the advantages are of course if you are looking for the balance transfer on cards to new one then its same and in fact may at times be more expensive

there is a whole pile of information on tfsas here i recommend reading it there is no penalty for withdrawing money from a tfsa as such you can withdraw from it at any time the only restriction is that you ca n't put the money you took out back in the same year unless you have sufficient contribution room for it to be considered an additional contribution this scenario explains it there may be penalties for withdrawing money from the investment vehicle into which you paid the tfsa contents for example your tfsa contents may be in a mutual fund or in an interest bearing savings account if those have restrictions on how much you can withdraw or have penalties for withdrawl then you will have to abide by the rules and pay any penalties

my understanding is you can create a company 0 value then you need to either loan the company the money to buy the building it will still have 0 value as it will have a debt equal to it 's assets or sell share to investors at any price you like to raise the money to buy the building   once shares have value as valued by a chartered accountant not anyone can do this then anyone shares will have to pay income tax this is why keeping the shares as no value for as long as possible can be preferable also a benefit of using share options talk to your investors see what they require

here 's how the police currently operate   you are forced to fund them with your tax money but if they fail to protect you or your property you get nothing in return if you pay a home owner 's insurance company and you get robbed or your house burns down they fully reimburse you what exactly are we getting for our police dollars they come after the crime and then put the criminal in jail at our we lose both ways it 's pretty clear that insurance is preferable to police and that insurance companies should expand their operations to include active security personnel to patrol their insured properties and people while the government 's police force should be and give us that portion of our taxes back   i just want to get more people realizing what a con job government 's monopoly services are in terms of what we get for our money every where the government services interface with us they involve forcing us to stop in some capacity their transportation vehicles stop in the middle of the roads school buses and city buses and their solution to are pathetic in comparison to which do n't leave half the cars stopped at any given time they spend $ 4 6 trillion in wars against desert morons because the other branch of govt which was supposed to round up immigrants who their visas failed we pay for their failure we 've been forced to pay over $ 16 trillion over 50 years for welfare checks to people who are more likely stupid than intrinsically needy i.e. poor due to circumstances rather than basic stupidity $ 16,000 billion we could have had to fund on the things we want more of such as space research roads better technology

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

gt;it 's sad when i hear young workers talk about their job application strategies more often than not they involve figuring out how to fool the hr bots   lol   it took me a second with your hr bots to realize you were talking about the software and not the hr personnel   because i have always even 30 years back viewed hr as basically operating on a lot of faulty fundamental assumptions the best way to get hired even back then before the software application screening process was to do an end run around hr   part of the reason is that hr or previously the personnel dept was really designed from the get go only to fill the generic factory worker positions jobs that had minimal base level skill requirements i.e. the checkbox type stuff where any relatively intelligent person should be able to determine with a pretty high accuracy whether the candidates could do the job in other words the open positions that were effectively commodities and where the turnover was high and/or the number of people employed fairly large   but then a combination of hr wanting to be more professional combined with the advent of the generic mba manager who believes he she can manage anything without specific domain knowledge or experience created an opening for hr to take over the hiring of virtually all positions   so what we ended up with was the generic mba manager lacking domain knowledge experience shifting the responsibility or at least most of it for candidate filtering amp hiring off to generic hr people processes who pretty much by definition lack domain knowledge experience and who then attempted to the whole thing     add in stuff like equal opportunity anti discrimination laws and lawsuits to drive the generic of the whole process and you have the perfect pre conditions for the storm that is the current fiasco   so we end up with generic and lets face it often ignorant managers taking job requirements and coming up with checklist style help wanted ads cs degree 5 10 years of ruby on rails work experience hr departments that are clueless about the validity availability of those requirements pretty much just the crap into the ads amp application filtering software in a rote fashion and like a badly constructed google search it should n't be surprising that they come up with minimal results   of course within the discarded applicants are probably several potentially excellent hires but they will simply never be found     so smart people will still again do their best not to game the bots but to do an end run around the whole thing   and that means using your network to get your name in the door and your resume in the hands of the person that matters within the company that may or just as often may not be the manager who makes the hiring decision it may very well be the most experienced person in his department who then pushes the manager to interview and hire you and you preferably do that before the damned ad is even written and before the hr department is even aware that there is a need for a hire keep in mind that there is often a span of several weeks if not several months between the real awareness of a need and the manager hr getting around to actually starting the help wanted fiasco ridden process   one key aspect of that is that via the in the door ahead of time even if the company requires the hr process to be followed the job spec can be constructed to match the pre qualified candidate and his her resume can go to the top of the stack already being in the manager 's hands with a recommendation endorsement from one of his critical team members i.e. hire this guy gal   unfortunately it seems that for all the emphasis on networking these days colleges and other how to get hired classes seldom if ever teach those techniques   but if you ask around look around within companies and identify the really good fit people a lot of them will have been hired by this method and emphatically were not found via hr listings amp processes

as long as we 're just making up formulas i may as well just throw some numbers at it   the position at the forensic accounting firm would be paying 50 60 k likely starting salary with maybe 5 k bonus if he is super busy and busts his ass   whereas a position in banking would be paying about 75 k base with around 40 60 k in bonus let 's assume this is a boutique or mid level bank   so after year one he makes about $ 60 k more on the banking route after year 1 post graduation whereas he forfeited 10 k in summer salary plus the 5 k loan with interest which is tax deductible   pretty sure that it works out in his favor that way and that 's just after 1 year   yes i understand this simplifies things and assumes that he gets a job in banking solely due to the internship and could n't have gotten it otherwise   however if the internship significantly increases the likelihood p as you put it from .3 to it 's still wildly in his favor to do it given that the wage gap will only grow over time consider his base will be in yr 2 and in yr 3 whereas he 's looking at maybe 10 raises in the forensic accounting     look you can make up formulas all you want all i was saying is that in certain industries it 's absolutely legitimate to have unpaid internships   in this case $ payoff is a fairly high value and p is increased a significant amount

chip and signature cards do not substantially alter the paradigm you mention in your question the chip alters how the machine obtains your account number and it for authentication but it does not significantly alter the interaction with the clerk   it is solely intended to reduce skimming and similar card number stealing and card forging attacks specifically a clerk is still welcome to ask to see the card to verify the signature if they wish and/or to ask to see an id to use the card   some changes occurred around the same time as introducing chip and signature that meant that clerks will be less likely to ask for signatures for certain purchases raising the dollar amount for no signature required purchases mostly but those changes are distinct from the introduction of emv chip authentication

it seems ideal to have the employment be all about both income and ethics but the problem is that for most people in the industry more often at one point or another they will have to choose between their income or their ethics    ethics should always hold supremacy over personal gain because ethics maintain the relationships formal and informal between entities involved in the markets without those long term relationships there is no room for trust and therefore no reason to be willingness for entities to exchange with one another   if you do n't have a overall fair financial markets on the long term it will hurt the overall economy why because people will have no trust in buying equity prices there will be no trust in prospects   people will save most of their money in cash and outright avoid anything or everything about investing   if there are less clients there is less capital for the entire industry   the trust of the aggregate non active investing clients with the capital range between million matters and to make it common knowledge to hold personal gain above them is not a good way to have them keep their money in the markets

you have plenty of good answers but i want to add something that might help you grow your intuition on stocks there are a lot of differences between the example i am going to give and how the stock market actually runs but the basic concepts are the same lets say your friend asks you if he can borrow some money to start up a company in exchange you will have some ownership in this company you have essentially just bought yourself some stock now as your friend starts to grow he is doing well but he needs more cash to buy assets in order to grow the company more he is forced with an option either give you some of the profits or buy these assets sooner you decide you do n't really need the money right now and think he can do a lot better with spending the money to buy stuff this is essentially the same as a company electing to not pay dividends but instead invest into the future you as a stock holder are fine with it since you know the money is going toward investing in the future even if you never get paid a dividend as a company grows you can then turn around and sell the stock to someone else for more money then you gave originally of course you always take the risk of having the company failing and loosing some if not all of your investment but that is just the risk of the market

the fidelity funds have an expense ratio and while some funds may have little to no profit having you as a customer lets them try to sell you on their managed account portfolio and other services   it 's possible they do n't make much or any money from you at all but with so many accounts it 's fine as long as it averages out similar to having a credit card and never paying interest on it but reaping the rewards anyway averaged out they make plenty of money across all accounts an expense ratio is usually given as a percentage and it 's the amount you pay for the fund per year if it has a 1 er and you have $ 1,000 invested in it then it costs you $ 10 for the year a very simplified example you wo n't notice this as a direct transaction since it gets taken from the funds assets directly but this is lowering the return or worsening the loss on the fund you can find the er in your fidelity account for any funds that are available to you something else i thought of is that you add liquidity to their funds and your assets increase the amount under management which may be a selling point may lower overall costs etc

i do n't think this is always true it really depends on the quantities you 're looking for and the markets you 're in sounds like this guy is in many markets trying to find out the good niches therefore he 's not going all in on anything in the article he addresses the fact that some of these shops will sometimes have more orders connections and therefore more leverage than you might if going directly to the manufacturer i also would n't be surprised at all if many manufacturers especially the uber cheap ones do n't feel comfortable talking directly to westerners their expertise is making stuff cheap not in communications

there 's been some work on sentiment analysis and it 's effect on stock prices would be interesting to see a model that uses sentiment as well as more normal fundamentals to try model returns perhaps short term sentiment could explain some of the day by day while long term sentiment has an effect on long term prices

if you have sufficient money to support yourself until you have a career then paying off your student loan principal on unsubsidized federal loans is probably your best bet this is because interest accumulates before you 're actually required to pay if they are private make the payment on the highest interest rate loans

well of course you can protect effects toward the environment but the nature of private business is that you ca n't lead on a collective action problem like carbon emissions you need a political solution i think people overestimate how much business dominates politics the politicians still have to answer to constituents who are basically screaming to be the most extreme if business really dominated as much as everyone likes to say immigration reform would have been done years ago

both op and the author of the newspaper article should have titled this when the media take the time to explain the true state of our economy people are less optimistic about the future a simple link to graph would show that consumer confidence has rebounded but dipped during the debt crisis as it should have because the media were reminding people how utterly weak our economy is the fact that average hourly earnings today are exactly where they were in 2008 is a disaster but to state that americans perception of the economy is worse is flat wrong they actually perceive it as improving when in fact it 's on extremely shaky ground

in the u.s. each state has its own local usury law this website has a separate page for each state summarizing the local usury law and provides a reference to the local statute the rules are n't simple some set absolute limits some appear to be pegged to something like the prime rate some states do n't have a general usury limit the rules do n't apply to certain loans because of the type of loan or lender etc there are us federal laws dealing with usury primarily in the context of the rico act lets the feds go after that violate local usury laws beyond certain parameters

you remind me a lot of myself as i was thinking about marriage luckily for me my wife was much smarter about all this than i was hopefully i can pass along some of her wisdom both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other in marriage there is no more financial independence do not think in those terms life can throw so many curve balls that you will regret it imagine sitting down with your new bride and running through the math she is to contribute $ x to the family each month and you are to contribute $ y. then next thing you know 6 months later she has cancer and has to undergo expensive and debilitating treatment there is no way she can contribute her $ x anymore you tell her that is okay and that you understand but the pressure weighs down on her every day because she feels like she is not meeting your expectations   or alternatively everything goes great with your $ x $ y plan a few years down the road your wife is pregnant so you revisit the plan readjust etc everything seems great when your child is born however the baby has a severe physical or mental handicap you and your wife decide that she will quit her job to raise your beautiful child but the whole time in the back of her mind she ca n't get out of her head that she is no longer financially independent and not living up to your expectations these stresses are not what you want in your marriage here is what we do in my family hopefully some of this will be helpful to you every year my wife and i sit down and determine what our financial goals are for the year how much do we want to be putting in retirement how much do we want to give to charity do we want to take any family vacations we set goals together on what we want to achieve with our money there is no my money or her money just ours does n't matter where it comes from at the beginning of every month we create a budget in a spreadsheet it has categories like food mortgage or rent transportation clothing utilities and we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those it also has categories for entertainment retirement charity cell phones internet and so on again we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those in the spreadsheet we also track how much income we expect that month and our totals income minus expenses if that value is positive we determine what to do with the remainder maybe we save some for a rainy day or for car repairs maybe we treat ourselves to an extra fancy dinner the point is every dollar should be accounted for if she wants to go to dinner with some friends we put that in the budget if i want a new video game we put that in the budget once a week we take all our receipts and tally up where we spent our money we then see how we are doing on our budget maybe we were a little high in one category and lower than expected in another we adjust we are flexible but we go over our finances often to make sure we are achieving our goals some specific goals i 'd recommend that the two of you consider in your first such yearly meeting you get out of life what you put into it and you will get out of your finances what the two of you put into them by being on the same page your marriage will be much happier money finances are one of the top causes of divorce if you two are working together on this you are much more likely to succeed

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

i would prioritize paying off the heloc first    paying off the heloc has a guaranteed rate of return and will reduce the size of savings cushion you 'll need in the future however you should n't assume your heloc funds will remain available indefinitely    if you read your fine print you are not guaranteed access to your unused credit by the bank   if you lose your job or your home value significantly declines the bank could refuse to let you take more money out on your heloc    recently i 've seen people 's available credit be reset to 0 on open helocs by banks trying to reduce their exposure    planning on the future of available credit via a heloc is not a good safety net

just pick a good bond and invest all your money there since they 're fairly low risk no that is basically throwing away your money and why would you do that and who told you they are low risk that is a very wrong premise what factors should i consider in picking a bond and how would they weigh against each other quite a number of them to say assuming these are n't government uk etc how safe is the institution issuing the bond their income business they are in their past performance business wise and the bonds issued by them if any check for the bond ratings issued by the rating agencies read the prospectus and check for any specific conditions i.e. bonds are callable bonds can be retired under certain conditions what happens if they default and what order will you be debt take priority where are interest rates heading which will decide the price you are paying for the bond and also the yield you will derive from the bond how do you intend to invest the income coupon you will derive from the bonds what is your time horizon to invest in bonds and similarly the bond 's life i have invested in stocks previously but realized that it is n't for me bonds are much more difficult than equities stick to government bonds if you can but they do n't generate much income considering the low interest rates environment now that qe is over you might expect interest rates to rise but you can only wait or go for bonds from stable companies i.e. ge walmart and no i am not saying you buy their bonds in any imaginable way

definitely do n't borrow from your 401k.   if you quit or get laid off you have to repay the whole amount back immediately plus you are borrowing from your opportunity cost   the stock market should be good at least through the end of this year    as one of the commentators already stated have you calculated your net savings by reducing the interest rate   you will be paying closing costs and not all of these are deductible only the points are   when calculating the savings you have to ask yourself how long you will be hanging on the property   are you likely to be long term landlords or do you have any ideas on selling in the near future    you can reduce the cost and principal by throwing the equivalent of one to two extra mortgage payments a year to get the repayment period down significantly by years   in this way you are not married to a higher payment as you would be if you refinanced to a 15 year term    i would tend to go with a eat the appraisal cost not refinance and b throw extra money towards principal to get the term of the loan to be reduced

not charging taxes on a money losing investment or business is much more than humanitarian it is common sense in general money that is used to invest has already been taxed as income or inheritance to the person making the investment so taxing that money again not just the profit would provide a disincentive for people to invest which would be bad for economic growth over the medium and long term as far as taxing a money losing businesses goes most businesses do n't make money in their couple of years and adding further tax burdens would be counter productive because it would provide a major hurdle for people wanting to start a business other have already mentioned that the money losing operation likely paid indirect taxes as well small businesses provide a majority of the economic growth and innovation so in short additional taxes on money losing investments and businesses would be both foolish and shortsighted

the $ 20k limit seems to be from another answer the threshold for gofundme to report the campaign however such a report does not change the taxability of the income the income is either taxable or non taxable regardless of whether the amount is $ or $ this is a common misconception commonly seen when people think that income or gambling winnings are not taxable below $ 600 when in reality $ 600 is the threshold for issuing a form 1099 given that it would be foolish to close a wildly successful gofundme campaign because closing the campaign wo n't change the taxability of the income but it will probably cut off the continued donations you may have received with the amount of money at stake you should spend the couple hundred dollars to hire a cpa to look at your specific situation your uncle 's comments are not specific to your situation at best incorrect at worst so do n't hire him i do n't know what the median gofundme campaign raises but i strongly suspect it 's well below the $ donor reporting limit just because you have one campaign that 's gone viral enough to approach that limit does n't mean if you close that one and start a new one that it will go viral again especially if it 's under a new username

i think three things are happening right now   1 the stock market is one of the only sensible places to get a return on your money bond rates are very low and real estate is a little trickier    2 there are fewer publicly traded companies now than there have been in the past it 's easier to invest in public companies than private companies so more money is going into fewer companies inflating the prices   3 wealth inequality is higher now than it has been in decades if you give poor people more money they just spend it to lead more comfortable lives they wo n't invest in the stock market if you give a rich person more money they just invest more of it since they are already spending as much as they reasonably can in this economy for the past few decades we 've been giving the rich more and more money   so with these 3 factors more money is pouring into the fewer companies of the stock market inflating their prices    at least this is the idea put forward by a fidelity analyst i heard a talk from recently and it makes sense to me

a change in implied volatility tells us something about what investors are thinking or fearing about the volatility going forward for the life of the associated option contracts which may be short or long lived   iv does a good job of summarizing the information available to investors which includes information about the past and the present however whether these investor views actually translate into what happens in the future is a topic of debate in the finance literature investors do not generally know the future there are conflicting results available   there have been papers that show that implied volatility has predictive power in some situations time periods and horizons though it is also biased and other papers that show that it does not have statistically significant predictive power at all the consensus last time i checked was that implied volatility is no worse than historical volatility including methods that use trends in historical volatility to forecast where it is going at predicting future volatility   whether it is significantly better and whether either reliably predicts the future is something that is not agreed on   i take this lack of consensus as evidence that if it does predict future volatility it does so poorly somewhat dated survey on the subject

owning a stock via a fund and selling it short simultaneously should have the same net financial effect as not owning the stock   this should work both for your personal finances as well as the impact of not owning the shares has on the stock 's price to use an extreme example suppose there are 4 million outstanding shares of evil oil company   suppose a group of concerned index fund investors owns 25 of the stock and sells short the same amount    they 've borrowed someone else 's 25 of the company and sold it to a third party   it should have the same effect as selling their own shares of the company which they ca n't otherwise do   now when 25 of the company 's stock becomes available for purchase at market price what happens to the stock   it falls of course    regarding how it affects your own finances suppose the stock price rises and the investors have to return the shares to the lender   they buy 1 million shares at market price pushing the stock price up give them back and then sell another million shares short subsequently pushing the stock price back down if enough people do this to effect the share price of a stock or asset class the managers at the companies might be forced into behaving in a way that satisfies the investors   in your case perhaps the company could issue a press release and fire the employee that tried to extort money from your wife 's estate in order to win your investment business back   okay well maybe that 's a stretch

according to hmrc it seems that if you overpay then at least part of the interest generated by that isa is taxable emphasis mine if by mistake you put more than £ into your isas in a tax year the excess payments are invalid and you are not entitled to any tax relief on investments purchased with the excess payments you should not try to correct this mistake yourself instead you should call the isa helpline and explain the problem to them they will advise you what action you need to take however as pointed out hmrc also states in section 6.1 here that the isa manager ie the bank building society should not allow you to overpay systems must ensure that no more than the cash isa subscription limit can be subscribed to a cash isa in a tax year and that no more than the overall subscription limit can be subscribed to a stocks and shares isa in a tax year as to what an individual isa manager would do should you attempt to over pay i imagine it would vary from manager to manager ing direct for example has the following policy taken from section 12.5 here f you send us a payment for an amount which would take you over the isa investment limit under the isa regulations we will send the excess above the investment limit    or if you sent us the payment by cheque the whole of that payment back to you

the thing about the glide path is that the closer you 're to the retirement age the less risk you should be taking with your investments all investments carry risk but if you invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 20 and lose all your retirement money it will not have the same effect on your retirement as if you 'd invest in a volatile stock market at the age of 65 and then lose all your retirement money static allocation throughout your life without changing the risk factor will lead you to a very conservative investment path which would mean you 're not likely to lose your investments but you 're not likely to gain much either the point of the glide path is to allow you taking more risks early with more chances of higher gains but to limit your risks down the road also limiting your potential gains that is why it is always suggested to start your retirement funds early in your life to make sure you have enough time to invest in potentially high return stocks with high risk but when you get close to your retirement age it is advised to do exactly the opposite the date targeted funds do that for you but you can do it on your own as well as to the academic research you do n't need to go that far just look at the graphs to see that over long period investments in stocks give much better return than conservative bonds and treasuries especially when averaging the investments as it usually is with the retirement funds but over a given short period investments in stocks are much more likely to significantly lose in value

even going to small claims court the burden would be on you to prove that they never paid you the 13 year gap would be the core of the argument by the company that they have no obligation to keep records from 13 years ago that is far longer than they need to keep them for tax purposes   even if they sent you a replacement check the next year that happened to me once the record of that transaction would have been 12 years ago the bank will not cash it because of the date being 13 years ago as we move forward with more and more of the checks being deposited via phone scanner the banks will be even less likely to handle stale checks because the fact you have the check in your hand does n't mean it was n't cashed

then at the end if you decide to cash in your house you can roll the    proceeds into a fancier house to avoid paying taxes on your profit the problem is that the book was written in 1989 that comment is no longer true that part of the tax law changed in the 1990 's also in 1989 the maximum amount that person could put in an ira was $ 2,000 and had n't been raised for almost a decade and would n't be raised for another decade roth accounts did n't exist nor did hsa 's or 529 's most people did n't have a 401k. you are asking to compare what options we have today compared to what was available in the late 1980 's   for me except for the years 2001 2005 and 2010 2015 the period from 1988 until now has had flat real estate values still the current values have n't returned to the peak in 2005 the score is 11 great years 17 flat or negative i know many people who during the 1990 's had a zero return on their real estate

probably the best way to investigate this is to look at an example first as the commenters above have already said the log return from one period is at time t price at time which is approximately equal to the percentage change in the price from time to time t provided that this percentage change is not big compared to the size of the price note that you have to use the natural log ie log to the base e button on a calculator here the main use of the log return is that is a proxy for the percentage change in the price which turns out to be mathematically convenient for various reasons which have mostly already been mentioned in the comments but you already know this your actual question is about the average log return over a period of time what does this indicate about the stock the answer is if the stock price is not changing very much then the average log return is about equal to the average percentage change in the price and is very easy and quick to calculate but if the stock price is very volatile then the average log return can be wildly different to the average percentage change in the price here is an example the closing prices for pitchfork oil from last week 's trading are 10 5 12 5 10 2 15 the percentage changes are 1.4 1 6.5 where means -50 etc the average percentage change is or on the other hand the log returns for the same period are 2 and the average log return is about if we used this as a proxy for the average percentage change in the price over the whole seven days we would get 6.8 instead of which is wildly wrong the reason why it is wrong is because the price fluctuated so much on the other hand the closing prices for united marshmallow over the same period are 10 11 12 11 12 13 15 the average percentage change from day to day is and the average log return is so in this case the log return is very close to the percentage change and it has the advantage of being from just the first and last prices because the properties of imply that it simplifies to notice that this is exactly the same as for pitchfork oil so one reason why you might be interested in the average log return is that it gives a very quick way to estimate the average return if the stock price is not changing very much another more subtle reason is that it actually behaves better than the percentage return when the price of pitchfork jumps from 5 to 12 and then crashes back to 5 again the percentage changes are + 140 and for an average of + 82 that sounds good but if you had bought it at 5 and then sold it at 5 you would actually have made 0 on your money the log returns for the same period do not have this disturbing property because they do add up to 0   what 's the real difference in this example well if you had bought $ 1 worth of pitchfork on tuesday when it was 5 and sold it on wednesday when it was 12 you would have made a profit of $ 1.40 if you had then bought another $ 1 on wednesday and sold it on thursday you would have made a loss of $ overall your profit would have been $ this is what the average percentage return is calculating on the other hand if you had been a long term investor who had bought on tuesday and hung on until thursday then quoting an average return of 82 is highly misleading because it in no way corresponds to the return of 0 which you actually got   the moral is that it may be better to look at the log returns if you are a buy and hold type of investor because log returns cancel out when prices fluctuate whereas percentage changes in price do not but the flip side of this is that your average log return over a period of time does not give you much information about what the prices have been doing since it is just price of periods since it is so easy to calculate from the initial and final prices themselves you commonly wo n't see it in the financial pages as far as i know   finally to answer your question does knowing this single piece of information indicate something about the stock i would say not really from the point of view of this one indicator pitchfork oil and united marshmallow look like identical investments when they are clearly not knowing the average log return is exactly the same as knowing the ratio between the final and initial prices

yes depending on what you 're trying to achieve if its just a symbolic gift you can use a service like this there are several companies providing this service look them up but the prices are fairly the same you 'll end up getting a real stock certificate but it will cost a lot of overhead around $ 40 to get the certificate and then another $ 40 to deposit it into a brokerage account if you want to sell it on a stock exchange so although the certificate is real and the person whose name on it is a full blown shareholder it does n't actually have much value unless you buy a google or apple stock where the price is much much higher than the fees take into account that it takes around 2 months for the certificate to be issued and mailed to you so time accordingly otherwise you can open a custodial brokerage account and use it to buy stocks for the minor both ways are secure and legal each for its own purpose and with its own fees

your assertion that you will not be selling anything is at odds with the idea that you will be doing tax loss harvesting   tax loss harvesting always involves some selling you sell stocks that have fallen in price and lock in the capital losses which gives you a break on your taxes   if you absolutely prohibit your advisor from selling then you will not be able to do tax loss harvesting in that case why are you using an advisor at all tax loss harvesting has nothing to do with your horizon nor the active passive difference really as a practical matter a good tax loss harvesting plan involves mechanically selling losers and immediately putting the money in another stock with more or less similar risk so your portfolio does n't change much   in this way you get a stable portfolio that performs just like a static portfolio but gives you a tax benefit each year   the irs officially prohibits this practice via the wash sale rule that says you ca n't buy a substantially identical asset within a short period of time   however though two stocks have similar risk they are not generally substantially similar in a legal sense so the irs ca n't really beat you in court and they do n't try   basically you ca n't just buy the same stock again the is advertising that they will perform this service keeping your portfolio pretty much static in terms of risk in such a way that your tax benefit is maximized and you do n't run afoul of the irs

no as a director normally you ca n't as a director of a limited company all those payments should be accounted for as directors remuneration and have been subject to paye and even if you are self employed currently there is no legislation which prevents a director from receiving self employment income from a company in which he is a director however the default position of hmrc 's is that all the payments derived from the are subject to paye in other words it 's possible only invoice from an business or in a consultancy role that 's not directly related to the trade of business but it really depends on the circumstances and the contracts in place sources at forum david at and at   more sources if a person does other work that ’s not related to being a director they may have an employment contract and get employment rights source employment status as director at gov.uk in principle it is possible for an employee or office holder to tender for work with their employer outside their normal duties in circumstances where that individual will not be providing service as an employee or office holder but as a self employed contractor where there is any doubt about whether service is provided constitutes employment or self employment see the employment status manual source section 62 2003 at hmrc

one estimate is to sell today estimate the taxes and determine how much cash you need to set aside over the next 12 months the is no way to calculate what impact dividends and capital gains the funds will have because unlike interest they are n't guaranteed the other complexity is that the funds themselves could drop in value in that case the dividends and capital gains may not even be enough to get you back to even i use mutual funds to invest over the long term with the idea of spending the funds over decades when needing to save for a short term goal i use banking products they are guaranteed not to lose value and the interest changes are thus easier to predict

you are on the right track with your math but be wary of your assumptions if you can borrow money at x% and can afford to make payments on the debt and you can get a return of > x% from investing then you would make more money by keeping the debt and investing your savings another way to think of it by paying off the debt you are getting a guaranteed 5 return because that 's the rate you 'd have paid if you kept the debt be wary of your assumption of getting a 10 return in the s&p 500 nothing is guaranteed even over the long term actual results may well be less and you could lose money it does n't have to be all or nothing why not pay off the higher rate debt at 5 and keep the 3 debt that 's a guaranteed 5 return by paying off the loan and 3 is a pretty low interest rate if you can afford to make the payments i see nothing wrong with investing your savings instead of paying off the loan make sure you have an emergency fund too

wall street salaries are rather exorbitant but its influence is far from insignificant   do you know where pensions come from the money that veterans and retirees rely on to survive hedge funds   how do the firms and companies that employ all those workers listed in greater numbers institutional money management aka hedge funds as a small subset    a company in distress and is in threat of laying off thousands of employees what can help it a private equity firm that will actively work to save and restore the company for it 's own profit but the employees will still have jobs    no large company with tens of thousands of employees can exist right now without the capital raising and transaction advisory services of an investment bank stock trading as a means to grow personal wealth would not exist    while true these institutions make a disproportionate amount money you must consider why nearly all front office jobs on wall street have hours investment banking analysts have up to 100 hours a week that 's salary per hour hedge fund managers wake up at night sweating to check asia markets to see if they 'll still have a job these are not the suburban 9 5 jobs where you can actually have weekends the high salary comes from an extremely rare skillset that 's taught only from experience not in schools high stress and commitment and the highest quality of labor mostly ivy on wall street they 've worked their asses off for these jobs    salary has to do with supply and demand i have the respect for janitorial workers because they do what we do n't want to do but their pay is n't great because anyone can be a janitor if most people in the country could build a portfolio with a sharpe ratio higher than 2 that billions of pension dollars would rely on then we wo n't have such high hedge fund salaries for example

your analogy seems relevant to me but it is not just speculation in the long run investing in stocks is like investing in the economy in the long run the economy is expected to grow hence stock prices are expected to go up now in theory the price of any financial instrument is equal to the net present value today of all the future cash flows from the instrument so if company 's earnings improve shareholders hope that the earnings will trickle down to them either in form of dividends or in form of capital gain so they buy the stock creating demand for it i can try to explain more if this did not make any sense

there are a few scenarios i see possible   1 risk parameters in the algo were set very conservatively putting quotes out and canceling them is very common    2 it was looking to exploit situations where someone through the book with a market order   3 it was reacting too slowly to signals and chasing opportunities that had already passed    other comments what do you believe front running is your version differs from the textbook definition    quote taxes are more effective than minimum order durations i wrote about how that works in a previous post in this thread

i 'm no expert on this but i would say that if you own the business entirely yourself there is nothing terribly wrong with using it for your own purposes as you would any other asset that you own   what is wrong is not keeping accurate records that distinguish between your money and the business 's   as you say this is wrong strategically but it can also be dangerous legally because if you mix your money and the business 's money and do n't keep track you could find for instance that you 've failed to pay the taxes you were supposed to there is also a concern that might not fall under what people refer to as ethics but more good corporate citizenship   basically people tend not to like companies that just shovel all their gains into the owners pockets   this is especially true if there are ways the money could be used to improve the business   in other words if you 're able to live high on the hog with the profits while paying all your employees a pittance the public may not look favorably on your business

it can be difficult when all your disposable income is spoken for   your options depend on how good your credit is and how flexible your expenses are   i do n't have all the answers without more details possibly not then   however couple of points of advice paying off that credit card debt and not adding any more to it is your 1 priority   you should make minimum payments to every other debt until you have done that because the interest on it will kill you in the mean time   it is always optimal to pay the maximum to your highest interest debt and minimum to all other debts 11 does n't sound very good on your house loan   you may want to consider refinancing   that is if you can get a lower rate   you may also want to get a longer term loan if you have enough discipline to use the extra income to actually pay off your credit card and then the put it toward the house when the cards are paid off look at options to increase your income at least temporarily   second jobs and such   when your finances are more in order you can back off the debt trap is behavioral   we humans tend to increase our spending until we ca n't any more   but the reason we ca n't spend any more is that we have increased our debt until we have no flexible income   then we are stuck for a long time and have few options the only way out long term is to change our habits so that we do n't increase spending each time we pay down a debt or get an increase to our income   financial discipline is the only way to have financial security   almost always the first step is to pay off credit cards and stop maintaining a balance always pay off every card at the end of each month   then start paying off other debts from highest interest rate to lowest this is a hard challenge and one most of us face at some point in our lives   good luck

the issue is online stores driving prices down and that drives down revenue and more importantly profit   the most effective way to cut costs is to cut wages and that leaves uneducated and under qualified employees at a retail establishment    the business model simply can not be sustained    walmart has it right   leave everything to the consumer to decide and neglect to give them assistance   until a sales associate earns more than their wage in profit they are losing the company money assuming their only job is to sell   electronics sales has very little profit outside of the extra items such as cables cases protection plans etc so they really have to be a professional sales associate to be valuable   professionals cost money and become the managers or more which brings us back to the uneducated and under qualified associates that walk the floors

if you want to predict the the easiest solution is to get hold of a copy of last year 's tax forms and fill them in with estimated numbers   odds are that none of the more complicated deductions will apply to you this first time around so i 'd suggest just using the federal 1040ez and your state 's equivalent for this purpose if it turns out that you can claim anything more than the standard deduction that would reduce your taxes so this is leaning toward the safe side

you 're assuming here that anything that is difficult to obtain will be highly desired   for me value is largely determined by the buyer even if it takes the same effort to get 20 bushels of apples and a nugget of gold if the majority of people find a nugget of gold to be worth 100 bushels that will be the value of gold    conversely lets say there is an element buried deep in the earth that has no use whatsoever even if it takes the effort of 10 nuggets of gold because nobody has any use for it its value will be zero even though there is high effort to procure   i hope that clarifies your question of the exchange rate it is determined by how much each party values the goods involved

gt;why not talk about services why should i pay more for services it 's not like more income means i use the roads and bridges more more income does n't mean more kids that need public education more income does n't mean i use fire services more   actually it does your ability to make more kinda depends on the ability of others to provide their skill or their ability to purchase more or if you own a business you need the fire service to protect your business operating during after a crisis as well as your home   this is kinda how the economy works   gt;if you ask me i 'd rather people just pay for the services they use have kids then you pay for their school drive 60 minutes to work then you pay more than someone that drives 10 minutes   except its much cheaper for everyone if it is all bound up together and provided by the government   seriously the arguments you are making are retarded like sitting in the back of the classroom eating glue retarded there is a reason that no country emphasis on no country does it the way you are saying and that is because it was done this way a couple of hundred years ago and we moved on from that because it does n't work as well   i understand the anti big government argument its just that it is taken to such an extreme now that its just stupid

i would make a change to the answer from if you buy a call that 's because you expect that the value of call options will go up so if you still think that options prices will go up then a sell off in the stock may be a good point to buy more calls for cheaper it would be your call at that point no pun intended here is some theory which may help an options trader in a bank would say that the value of a call option can go up for two reasons the vix index is a measure of the levels of implied volatility so you could intuitively say that when you trade options you are taking a view on two components the underlying stock and the level of the vix index importantly as you get closer to the expiry date this second effect diminishes big jumps up in the vix will produce smaller increases in the value of the call option taking this point to its limit at maturity the value of the call option is only dependent on the price of the underlying stock an options trader would say that the vega of a call option decreases as it gets closer to expiry a consequence of this is that if pure options traders are naturally less inclined to buy and hold to expiry because otherwise they would really just be taking a view on the stock price rather than the stock price the implied volatility surface trading options without thinking too much about implied is of course a valid strategy maybe you just use them because you will automatically have a mechanism which limits losses on your positions but i am just trying to give you an impression of the bigger picture

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

while there are many very good and detailed answers to this question there is one key term from finance that none of them used and that is net present value while this is a term generally associate with debt and assets it also can be applied to the valuation models of a company 's share price the price of the share of a stock in a company represents the net present value of all future cash flows of that company divided by the total number of shares outstanding this is also the reason behind why the payment of dividends will cause the share price valuation to be less than its valuation if the company did not pay a dividend that those future outflows are factored into the npv calculation actually performed or implied and results in a current valuation that is less than it would have been had that capital been retained unlike with a fixed income security or even a variable rate debenture it is difficult to predict what the future cashflows of a company will be and how investors chose to value things as intangible as brand recognition market penetration and executive competence are often far more subjective that using 10 year libor rates to plug into a present value calculation for a floating rate bond of similar tenor opinion enters into the calculus and this is why you end up having a greater degree of price variance than you see in the fixed income markets you have had situations where companies such as amazon.com google and facebook had highly valued shares before they they ever posted a profit that is because the analysis of the value of their intellectual properties or business models would overtime provide a future value that was equivalent to their stock price at that time

i ca n't give you proper legal advice but if i called their customer service and used half an hour of my time to wait and explain the situation in detail and their official response was just use the points i would do just that of course you would have stronger legal standing if you had recorded their answer or had it in writing from them but i do n't think spending these points will come crashing down on you and morally i see absolutely no problem with spending these points it is not as if you are stealing from someone else these points can usually be given away in any kind of crazy manner sometimes there are lotteries or events where they give away 100,000 points for new customers who open up an account on a specific weekend sometimes they give points to customers who want to terminate their contracts as an attempt to them into staying they have given you a lot of points and do n't really care as a result you are probably staying their customer forever and will most likely tell this story to many friends this is free advertising for them heck maybe they would even make a news story out of this some day it could be good publicity everyone is essentially getting these points for free but in fact the company has a business case by improving their image and customer retention with these points so you can spend these points with a sound mind morally legally you would have to contact a lawyer but i think chances for legal repercussions are small if you have done your duty informed them and their customer service basically said it 's ok

ethically you and your landlord should always report both income and expense as there technically exists a service and a rent so it is subject to taxation on the other hand it can be considered an exchange of a simple favour and if it does n't involve a money exchange or any profits i am assuming that you are not selling what you or your landlord produce on the market no value can be calculated thus no taxation can be applied this changes though if a contract is involved as a legal value can be estimated caution these subjects can vary on an extreme level of of what can and can not be claimed as income and expense which can vary per country state province and even per judge as well as the nature and sector of the work also if you intend to formalize this relationship the type of contract and reporting forms do vary per state as well so it might be best to confirm it with a local legal advisor to avoid unfortunate surprises

how can one offset exposure created by real estate purchase provides a similar discussion even if such a product were available in the precise increments you need the pricing would make it a loser for you there 's no free lunch in this case and the cost to insure against the downside would be to the true risk say you bought a $ 100 k home at today 's valuations the downside over a given year might be say 20 it might cost you $ 5000 to insure against that $ 20 k risk   let me offer an example the spy s&p etf is now at $ a $ 160 dec 14 put costs $ 7.50 so if you fear a crash you can pay 4 but only get a return if the market falls by over 14 if it falls just 10 you lose your premium    with only 5 down you will get a far better risk adjusted return by paying down the mortgage to < 78 ltv and requesting pmi if any be removed even if no pmi in 5 years you 'll have 20 more equity than otherwise over the long term 5 year 's housing inflation would be ~ 15 or so this process would help insure you are not underwater in that time not guarantee but help

most of stock trading occurs on what is called a secondary market for example microsoft is traded on nasdaq which is a stock exchange an analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car when you sell a used car to a third person the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading still within the same analogy when the car is first sold money goes directly to the maker actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes in the case of stock trading this is called an initial public offering ipo seasoned public offering for most purposes what this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential let me add some nuance to this say this drop from 20 $ to 10 $ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity stock in the future it is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1 have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2 obtain less financing overall this could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing one last note in any case financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital i.e. interest paid because it is neither revenue nor expense financing obtained from debt increases assets cash and liabilities debt and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets cash and shareholder equity

to a certain degree the only sure thing i know is the price i paid for the stock is the fair price at the time i buy it is absolutely right by definition and by the law of the free and efficient market and forces of supply and demand freedom of public information about share price sensitive information etc etc etc and you 've made a good point that many investors i 'd say however in practise the market has many participants and they will all be arriving at a different idea of what the fair price is by way of a slightly different analysis and slightly different information in theory they all have the same information but unfortunately in practise there is always some disparity when one participant feels a stock is undervalued though the last thing they want to do is say so instead they will start buying stock they might feel it is undervalued by 20 but that does n't mean they 'll keep buying and buying until it gets to 20 they might push the price up just a little then let the price drift down again buy some more relax buy some more etc over time the price will rise of course because the supply will become weaker but even if the participant is correct about the 20 the price might have only risen 7 by the time they acquire all the stock they want given their risk models market exposure and margin guidelines etc and it might be more than a year later before the price has actually risen to 20 presumably because more and more other market participants have come to the same conclusion the opposite can obviously also happen a participant might dump stock it feels is over valued long before it hits the values it believes in so right away you can see that pricing might not really reflect value or fair price

if you download the historical data from yahoo you will see two different close prices the one labeled close is simply the price that was quoted on that particular day the one labeled adj close is the close price that has been adjusted for any splits and dividends that have occurred after that date   for example if a stock splits 10:1 on a particular date then the adjusted close for all dates prior to that split will have been divided by 10 if a dividend is paid then all dates prior will have that amount subtracted from their adjusted quote using the adjusted close allows you to compare any two dates and see the true relative return

the risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both    however in terms of mitigating the risk investor a is conservative on upside ie will exit if he gets 10 while is ready to take unlimited downside his belief is that things will not go worse while investor b is wants to make at least 10 less than peak value and in general is less risk averse as he will sell his position the moment the price hits 10 less than max peak value so it more like how do you mitigate a risk as to which one is wise depends on your belief and the loss appetite

this may vary some by the state but the general facts are consistent broadly the elements of check fraud typically are this means that not only do you have to have presented a check that is returned for insufficient funds but you must have known at the time that it would n't be honored    it must typically also be given for present consideration which is why the comments to the other answer correctly note that the post dated check scam cooked up by the payday loan folks should n't generally be relevant under these laws on the same site they note the cases that are clearly not present consideration so if i give you a check for $ 50 and it 's returned for nsf because i screwed up my bank accounts and had all my money in savings that 's probably not fraud   but if i decide i really want a tesla x and give tesla motors a check for $ 95,000 knowing i do n't have $ 95,000 that 's fraud how the prosecutor proves knowledge is probably beyond the scope of personal finance and money stack exchange though i imagine it tends to commonly be done so by showing the person does n't normally have that much money in their account

even with non voting shares you own a portion of the company including all of its assets and its future profits   if the company is sold goes out of business and liquidates etc those with non voting shares still stand collect their share of the funds generated   there 's also the possibility as one of the comments notes that a company will pay dividends in the future and distribute its assets to shareholders that way the example of google also mentioned in the comments is interesting because when they went to voting and non voting stock there was some theoretical debate about whether the two types of shares goog and googl would track each other in value   it turned out that they did not people did put a premium on voting so that is worth something   even without the voting rights however google has massive assets and each share goog and googl represented ownership of a fraction of those assets and that kept them highly correlated in value   google had to pay restitution to some shareholders of the non voting stock as a result of the deviation in value i wo n't get into the details here since it 's a bit of tangent but you could easily find details on the web

it depends on your tax rate multiply your marginal rate including state if applicable by your 3.1 to figure out how much you are saving through the deduction then subtract that from the 3.1 to get the effective rate on the mortgage for example if you are in the 28 bracket with no state tax impact from the mortgage your effective rate on the mortgage is this also assumes you 'd still itemize deductions without the mortgage otherwise the effective deduction is less others have pointed out more behavioral reasons for wanting to pay off the car first but from a purely financial impact this is the way to analyze it this is also your risk free rate to compare additional investing to after taking into account taxes on investments

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

assume they do not you pay in $ 500/mo and every time it hits $ 3000 they pay the tax engineers call this a function it looks like this   the average balance is not $ 3000 but close to $ 1500 the very simple math is $ 1500 rate years   it looks like your equation except it 's not 58 it 's just the years and the question is whether you can make more than $ 850 on $ 1500 average before you sell i would n't be so quick to plug in 29 years as the average home ownership is 7 years and depending who knows if a refinance is in your future   the bottom line how long would it take you to get a 57 return ironically the most responsible and risk averse person would say decades banks offer less than 1 even an 8 market return while not guaranteed is close to 7 years but if you carry 18 credit card debt you can pay it down a bit each month and let it float back up every 6 months less than 4 years to break even

in your entire question the only time you mention that this is an investment inside an ira is when you say every quarter six months whatever i d have to rebalance my ira while vanguard would do this for the fund of funds without me needing to within an ira there are no tax implications to the rebalancing but if this investment were not inside an ira then the rebalancing done by you will have tax implications in particular any gains realized when you sell shares in one fund and buy shares in another fund during the rebalancing process are subject to income tax similarly losses also might be realized and will affect your taxes however if you are invested in a fund of funds there are no capital gains or capital losses when re balancing is done you have gains or losses only when you sell shares of the fund of funds for a price different than the price you paid for them

i have had similar thoughts regarding alternative for the reasons you mention but for the most part they do n't exist   gold is often mentioned but outside of 1972 1974 when the us went off the gold standard it has n't been very effective in the diversification role   cash can help a little but it also fails to effectively protect you in a bear market as measured by portfolio drawdowns as well as std dev relative to gov't bonds there are alternative assets reverse etfs etc which can fulfill a specific short term defensive role in your portfolio but which can be very dangerous and are especially poor as a long term solution while some people claim to use them for effective results i have n't seen anything verifiable i do n't recommend them gov't bonds really do have a negative correlation to equities during periods in which equities underperform timing is often slightly delayed and that makes them more valuable than any other asset class as a   if you are concerned about rate increases avoid lt gov't bond funds   intermediate will work but will take a few hits short term bonds will be the safest   personally i 'm in 30 and willing to take the modest hit in exchange for the overall portfolio protection they provide against an equity downturn   if the hit concerns you tips may provide some long term help assuming inflation rises along with rates to some degree i personally think tips give up too much return when equity performance is strong but it 's a modest concern tips may suit you better than any other option   in general i 'm less concerned with a single asset class than with the long term performance of my total portfolio

for a job doing that kind of stuff what is preferred is 4 year undergrad at ivy league school + 2 year mba at ivy league school and then several more years of experience which you can sort of get by interning while in school this will of course saddle you with debt which is counterintuitive to your plans basically the easy way up is percentage based compensation without knowing the right people you will get a piss poor salary regardless of what you do in the beginning so portfolio managers earn money by percentage based fees and can manage millions and billions real estate agents can earn money by percentage based commissions if they close a property and other business venture owners can do the same thing the problem with how to trade books is that they are outdated by the time they are published so you should just stick with literature that teaches a fundamental knowledge of the products you want to trade make money from ultimately regardless of how you get earn your initial capital you will still need to be an individual investor to grow your own capital this has nothing to do with being a portfolio manager even highly paid individuals on wall street are in debt to lavish expenditures and have zero capital for their own investments hope this helps you really need to be thinking in a certain way to just quickly deduce good ideas from bad ideas

thanks just to clarify i am looking for a more value neutral answer in terms of things like sharpe ratios i think it 's an oversimplification to say that on average you lose money because of put options even if they expire 90 of the time they still have some expected payoff that kicks in 10 of the time and if the price is less than the expected payoff you will earn money in the long term by investing in put options i am sure you know this as a phd student i just wanted to get it out guess more formally my question would be are there studies on whether options prices correspond well to the diversification benefits they offer from an mpt point of view

it matters because that is the requirement for the 83(b selection to be valid since the context is 83(b election i assume you got stocks options as compensation and did n't pay for them the fmv thus it should have been included in your income for that year if you did n't include the election letter i can only guess that you also did n't include the income hence you lost your election if you did include the income and paid the tax accordingly or if no tax was due you actually paid the fmv you may try amending the return and attaching the letter but i 'd suggest talking to a professional before doing it on your own make sure to keep a proof usps certified mailing receipt of mailing the letter within the 30 days window

but i wish to know why the parameter is dividend market price rather than just dividend what extra info you can uncover by looking at dividend market price that you can not get from dividend consider two stocks a and b. a offers a dividend of $ 1 per year b offers a dividend of $ 2 per year let 's remove all complications aside and assume that this trend continues if you were to buy each of these stocks you will get the following amounts over its life assumed infinity for simplicity cash flows from a = $ = $ 25 assuming risk free is 4 per annum cash flows from b = $ = $ 50 assuming risk free is 4 per annum the price you buy them at is an important factor to consider because let 's say if a was trading for $ 10 and b for $ 60 then a would look like a profitable while b wo n't of course this is a very simplistic view dividend rates are not constant and many companies pose a significant risk of going bust but this should help illustrate the general idea behind the d p ratio the formula i have used is one for computing the npv of a perpetuity

if i were you i would rent   wait to buy a home   here is why when you say that renting is equal in cost to a 30-year mortgage you are failing to consider several aspects   see this recent answer for a list of things that need to be considered when comparing buying and renting you have no down payment   between the two of you you have $ 14,000 but this money is needed for both your emergency fund and your fiancée 's schooling in your words we ca n’t afford a home   a home is a big financial commitment   if you buy a home before you are financially ready it will be continuous trouble    if you need a cosigner you are n't ready to buy a home   i would absolutely advise whoever you are thinking about cosigning for you not to do so   it puts them legally on the hook for a house that you ca n't yet afford you are n't married yet   you should never buy something as big as a home with someone you are n't married to there are just too many things that can go wrong   see comments for more explanation   wait until you are married before you buy your income is low right now   and that is okay for now you 've been able to avoid the credit card debt that so many people fall into however you do have student loans to pay and taking on a huge new debt right now would be potentially disastrous for you   your family income will eventually increase when your fiancée gets her degree and gets a job and at that time you will be in a much better situation to consider buying a house you need to move asap buying a house when you are in a hurry is a generally a bad idea when you look for a home you need to take some time looking so you are n't rushed into a bad deal that you will regret even if you decide you want to buy you should first find a place to rent then you can take your time finding the right house   to answer your question about escrow when you own a house two of the required expenses that you will have besides the mortgage payment are property taxes and homeowner 's insurance   these are large payments that are only due once a year   the bank holding the mortgage wants to make sure that they get paid   so to help you budget for these expenses and to ensure that these expenses are paid the bank will add these to your monthly mortgage payment and set them aside in a savings account called an escrow account   then when these bills come due once a year they are paid for out of the escrow account

gt you bring up the feds but that the issue because now we have to talk about monetary policy taxation is fiscal policy   if the goal is for more investments you have to account for loans and money supply far more investment is done on issued bonds than on retained profits   gt;the firm has more money they are going to spend it somewhere   that 's an oversimplification they 'll spend to maximize profit not to grow gdp the two are related but the first is n't always optimal to the second if a firm captures monopoly that 's bad for gdp   the examples in the link are relevant in that context they 're only a part of the economy 92 publicly held u.s. corporations that reported a u.s. profit every year from 2008 through 2015 they 're a non trivial portion of the economy and represent a large share of who will benefit from reducing corporate taxes so when you say gt;in general lowering taxes increases capital investment regardless of the investment rate   the counter point is that no the investment rate matters if spending those taxes produces a higher investment rate you have to adjust policy accordingly to know that you have to estimate the investment rate from a marginal reduction in taxes and compare to the investment rate resulting form your marginal fiscal program spending increase saying that lowering taxes increases investment is insufficient in the same sense that saying infrastructure spending increases investment is insufficient

figure out how much money you earn what you spend it on and how that will change when you have kids will one of you stay at home if not how much will daycare cost and how do you finance the first few month when your child is still too young for daycare you will usually plan to spend your current rent without utilities on your mortgage the that is secured by your house keep in mind though that a house usually has a higher utility cost than an appartment when you 've figured out what you can save pay towards a house now and how that will change when you have kids you can go on to the next step if you do n't want to buy now but want to commit to saving up for a house and also want to secure today 's really low interest rates consider getting a bausparvertrag   i did n't find a good translation for bausparvertrag so here is a short example of how it works you take a building saving sum of € with a savings goal of 50000 € the savings goal is usually between 20 and 50 of the sum and then you make monthly payments into the bausparvertrag until you reach the savings goal at which point you can take out your savings and a loan of 100000 € or whatever your difference between the and is if you 're living in an area you 're likely to need more than but this is just an example upsides downsides if you decide to buy sooner you can also use your bausparvertrag to refinance later if you have a decent income and a permanent job then ask your bank if they would consider financing your house now to get a sense of what you 'll be able to afford google and use a few of the many online calculators remember that these websites want to sell you on the idea of buying a house instead of paying rent so they 'll usually overestimate the raise in rents repeat the calculation with rent raise set to 0 to get a feeling for how much you 'll be able to afford in today 's money also do n't forget that you 're planning to get children so do the calculation with only one income not two and add the cost of raising the kids to your calculation once you 've decided on a property shop around a bit at different banks to get the best financing if you decide to buy now or soon start looking at houses now go to model homes to find out what style of house you like this is useful whether you want to buy an existing house or build a new one if buying an existing house is an option for you start visiting houses that are on sale in your area in order to practice what to ask and what to look for you should have a couple of visits under your belt before you really start looking for the one you want to buy once you 're getting closer to buying or making a contract with a construction company consider getting an expert when buying an existing house they can help you estimate the price and also estimate the renovation cost you 'll have to factor in for a certain house new heating better insulation when building a new house they can advise you on the contract with the construction company and also examine the construction company 's work at each major step source own experience

i also talked to the irs yesterday to get a few of my own questions answered and i asked a few of these while i was at it as i did n't know the answers for sure either even after reading irs pub 969 to answer your specific questions i would however like to confirm a few things you are allowed to have multiple hsa accounts my company forces me to    use a specific bank if they are going to be make contributions    however i would like to move this money to a higher risk higher yield    account you are allowed to withdraw money to reimburse any past payments that    were made after the hsa is opened perhaps years later this would    allow me to accumulate interest on the money and then get reimbursed    later you can transfer money between hsas etc and the money will still    cover any payments since the first hsa was opened i am currently unmarried and without children an hsa can be made to    pay for any dependent or spouse medical bills as well i am currently    signed up with an hsa that is marked as individual or something i    assume that once i get married i should have no issues using this    money from the past on my wife and kids note that i am not a certified tax professional and you should not rely on this information for your own tax decisions but should investigate or contact the irs yourself

for the period 1950 to 2009 if you adjust the s&p 500 for inflation and account for dividends the average annual return comes out to exactly source currently inflation is around 2   so your 2 apy is a 0 real return where the stock market return is 7   i.e. on average stocks have a return that is higher by 7    if you mix in bonds 70 stocks to 30 bonds your real returns will drop to around 5.5 but you are safer in individual years bonds often have good years when stocks have bad years    we 're making a bit of a false dichotomy here   we 're talking about returns on stocks in retirement accounts versus returns on cds in regular accounts   you can buy stocks in regular accounts and it is legally possible to have a cd in a retirement account   so you can get bankruptcy protection and tax advantages with a cd

no   floppy are simple magnetic media you could make yourself in your basement     flash memory hard drives etc have more code in their embedded controllers than that entire launch control system   if the floppy has enough storage why would you want to unnecessarily add a bunch of complexity for such a critical task as nuclear security

depends on where you live i live near and our tech sector was hit hard ibm is the worst for job cuts even when business was booming in the area it was hard to get an entry level position by entry level i mean basic networking a+ level stuff   when everything went pear shaped in 2008 my friends in the it industry were dropping like flies most of them had 15 years or more in experience were highly sophisticated and current in their skillsets   i know things are a little better in the midwest and towards cali the only place i know is in an economic boom by experience is nd $ 1500 signing bonus at sears if you do skilled work you get paid a premium   housing was two years out on a waiting list just ridiculous

i gather it 's been up until now cost prohibitive to build upward and in such an environment cities have a vested interest in maintaining their skyline they 'll probably need to adapt but the idea that zoning is capricious is false

it 's interesting that legacy manufacturing practices are now becoming important   how long until we see a lot of the traditional industrial control world get involved in the cannabis business   i ca n't wait to see and siemens spin up their marijuana divisions

they borrowed it from the people and typically to finance wars and military spending for example wikipedia suggests that the bank of england was set up to supply money to the king £ 1.2 m was raised in 12 days half of this was used to rebuild the navy it 's a game that everyone has to play once started if napoleon buys an army on credit you 'll have to raise an equal amount or face quite a problem as for why they 've grown so large it 's because governments are quite skilled at owing large sums of money only a small portion of the debt comes due in full at a given moment and they constantly reissue new debt via auction to keep it rolling so as long as they can make coupon interest and the lump sum at maturity it 's not difficult to keep up imagine how much credit card debt you could rack up if you only ever had to pay interest this game will continue for as long as people lend and there are plenty of lenders there 's pensions mutual funds and endowments which find public debt typically safer than stocks and money market funds which target 1 dollar nav and only invest in the safest aaa rated bonds to protect it there 's central banks which can buy and sell public debt to manipulate inflation and exchange rates   absent some kind of un resolution to ban lending or perhaps a eu mandated balanced budget these debts will likely continue to grow you think they collectively owe more money than can exist but there 's a lot of wealth in the world most nations owe less than a year 's gdp for example the us 's total wealth is in the neighborhood of 50 trillion

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

we do n't make enough to really consider it a salary but i 've heard    using a draw without a salary is a bad idea as any other illegal action not paying yourself a   reasonable salary when being a corporate officer is indeed a bad idea i have no idea what i need to do to actually get some money in our    pockets the answer is simple you need to earn more money since it is s corp it does n't matter if you keep the profits on the corporate account or distribute the profits will be taxed to you you are also as i said above required by law to pay yourself a reasonable salary reasonable meaning corresponding to market rates paying a cpa or a software engineer a minimum wage will not be reasonable that is of course if you 're profitable you 're not required to pay yourself more money than the corporation actually has just to be clear my answer refers to the question asked and the confusing answer above that made a claim that has no in the law i do not intend to write a thesis about pros and cons of using s corp every time a question about reasonable salary is asked

always a good time to buy gold think less in terms of commodities more in terms of true money that can not be inflated out of existence buy it as cheap as you can hold it for as long as possible the historical graphs never lie and it proves time and time again its a good store of value i would never think of it in terms of a speculative bet though if it does reward you its because the global currency system is broken i think its broken it may reward you but never expect it to reward you in the short term 2 3 years the gold price can be manipulated in the long term 10 years less so
