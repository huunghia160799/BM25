from the massachusetts department of revenue    1st massachusetts source income that is excluded    massachusetts gross income excludes certain items of income derived from sources within massachusetts non business related interest dividends and gains from the sale or exchange of intangibles and qualified pension income 2nd massachusetts source income that is included    massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from sources within massachusetts this includes income 3rd trade or business including employment carried on in massachusetts    a nonresident has a trade or business including any employment carried on in massachusetts if a nonresident generally is not engaged in a trade or business including any employment carried on in massachusetts if the nonresident 's presence for business in massachusetts is casual isolated and inconsequential a nonresident 's presence for business in massachusetts will ordinarily be considered casual isolated and inconsequential if it meets the requirements of the ancillary activity test and examples when nonresidents earn or derive income from sources both within massachusetts and elsewhere and no exact determination can be made of the amount of massachusetts source income an apportionment of income must be made to determine that amount considered massachusetts gross income 4th apportionment of income    apportionment methods    the three most common apportionment methods used to determine massachusetts source income are as follows    gross income is multiplied by a    so if you go to massachusetts to work you have to pay the tax   if you collect a share of the profit or revenue from massachusetts you have to pay tax on that   if you work from oregon and are paid for that work then you do n't pay massachusetts tax on that   if anything your company might have to pay oregon taxes on revenue you generate you are their agent or employee in oregon    does the answer change depending on whether the income is reported at 1099 or w-2 this should n't matter legally   it 's possible that it would be easier to see that the work was done in oregon in one or the other   i.e. it does n't make any legal difference but may make a practical difference    all this assumes that you are purely an employee or contractor and not an owner   if you are an owner you have to pay taxes on any income from your massachusetts business   note that this applies to things like copyrights and real estate as well as the business    this also assumes that you are doing your work in oregon   if you live in oregon and travel to massachusetts to work you pay taxes on your massachusetts income in massachusetts

a very simplified bond pricing equation goes thus 1 + interest ^ to reiterate that is a very simplified model but it allows us to demonstrate the 3 key factors that drive fair value the interest relative to the current market rate if your aaa bond yields 1 but an equally good aaa bond currently sells at 3 in the market then the equivalent value is the face value minus 2 1 3 for every year to maturity   years to maturity because 1 is multiplied for every year to maturity longer dated bonds are more sensitive to changes in market rates if your bond yields 2 less than market but matures in a year then it 's worth $ 98 but if it matures in 56 years then it 's only worth ^ 56 = $ 32 conversely if your bond yields more than the market rate then its price will be greater than face value the company might default on the debt if a bond has a fair value of $ 100 but you think there 's a 50 chance that the company will default then it 's only worth $ 50 in fact it can be worth even less because getting paid on a defaulted bond can often take time and/or money and/or lawyers in your case because your bond matures in 56 years but yields ~5 well above the current market rate for it to be below face value implies a strong probability of default or a strong belief that market returns will be above 5 over the next 56 years

i know that both lowes and home depot in canada at least will offer a 6 month deferred interest payment on all purchases over a certain dollar amount iirc $ 500 + and sometimes run product specific 1 year deferred interest specials this is a very effective way of financing renovations details you 've probably seen deferred interest it 's very commonly used in furniture sales no money down no interest do not pay for 1 full year   personally i think it 's a plot by the point manufacturers it works like this typically i manage these types of purchases by dividing the principal by 6 and then adding 5 and paying that amount each month   pay close attention to the end date because you do not want to pay 22 interest on the entire amount    this also requires that you watch your card balance carefully   all payments are usually put to current purchases i.e. those not under a plan first before they are applied to the plan balance   so if you are paying 250 a month on the new floor and run up another $ 150 on paint you need to pay the entire new balance and then the $ 250 floor payment in order for it to be applied correctly   also < shameless plug > < plug >   consider doing it yourself

all of 's reasons to say no are extremely valid there are also two more first the cost of a mortgage is not the only cost of owning a house you have to pay taxes utilities repairs insurance those are almost always hundreds of dollars a month and an unlucky break like a leaking roof can land you with a bill for many thousands of dollars second owning a house is a long term thing if you find you have to sell in a year or two the cost of making the sale can be many thousands of dollars and wipe out all the savings you made from owning rather than renting i would suggest a different approach although it depends very much on your circumstances and does n't apply to everybody if there is someone you know who has money to spare and is concerned for your welfare your mention of a family that does n't want you to work for academic reason leads me to believe that might be the case see if they are prepared to buy a house and rent it to you i 've known families do that when their children became students this is n't necessarily charity if rents are high compared to house prices owning a house and renting it out can be very profitable and half the battle with renting a house is finding a tenant who will pay rent and not damage the house presumably you would qualify you could also find fellow students who you know to share the rent cost

last month i spend about 3 4 days totally diving into the kindle e books drm etc   my goal was to basically replace my entire book collection online with books that i could edit etc     the result   kindle and the drm suck   the pirate experience an order of magnitude better than the kindle and drm experience   1   not all books are even available on the kindle or other drm platforms   pirated books   not a problem i can pretty much get any book i want in a matter of minutes   sometimes i have to spend a while to find them maybe 10 15 minutes   2   the quality of the drm books are horrible   for kindle they use fixed width graphics   however many of the pdf books that i 've been using use pdfs and vector graphics which means they look nice on my 30 monitor   4   i can use skim to edit and manipulate the books i can attach i can copy text out i can add bookmarks i can highlight pages   in kindle i can do this but it 's very basic and frankly the highlighting sucks and is hard to use     5   the kindle books are handicapped by the publishers and they wo n't let you actually copy text from them some of the publishers do let you do this but i want a consistent experience i do n't want to be reading a book and want to copy a paragraph to a friend only to find out that this is disabled   6   some of the magazine editions suck they are the same price as the news stand one but do n't actually include the full magazine   and no where on the site does it say this some of these do end up getting downvoted in the amazon reviews but i 've accidentally purchased a few of these and felt screwed   7   many most of the books you use do n't actually have an   they 're just flat out stripped removed   this is because the kindle pages and the book pages do n't line up however in pdf versions they are there and they 're working   i think the pdfs are the leaked master copy which they use to print the book   8   some of my kindle books are far inferior to the print edition that i actually own due to misc errors   for example one of them is missing a whole 2 chapters at the end which were author notes after the book was written but the kindle version says it 's the same edition as the one i own   9   what about bugs   if they make a mistake do they give you a new copy of the book   for example in 8 that 's clearly a bug they should have included those two chapters   do i get a new copy of the book when they fix it   will they ever fix it   do my notes highlights work with the new version do i get to keep the older version   in short i do not mind paying   in fact i allocated the money to upgrade my entire book collection to electronic   but i 'll be damned if i do that now the experience is so bad that i do n't want to give them the satisfaction of taking my money for this crap   further e books could be a revolution in the way we perceive books   why are we limiting ourselves to just text   why not interactive graphs spreadsheets charts i should be able to manipulate the examples change numbers zoom in etc     high resolution images for example that look awesome on my 30 display   video included embedded directly into the book   audio and audio commentary by the author   the entertainment industry went this way with dvds to encourage people to buy this format over the version   we need to do this with too     one could do this with html5 but it needs to be done right   some sort of simple zip with html inside which can be viewed by normal browsers    i 'll also say this i 'm not too concerned about the drm   just in terms of innovation this would be a major step forward     books and print media is dying but we could revolutionize it and embrace the digital publishing medium and really kick ass   edit   holy shit that was long the adderall must have just kicked in

reading great lakes page how payments are applied i think you are probably correct about how the payments are applied interest first minimum on each loan next then any extra is applied to the highest interest loan   if i were you i would make one payment a month and i would make that payment as large as i possibly could trying to make more than one payment in a month is too complicated and you are n't sure exactly how those payments get credited and saving up for a big payment every few months is pointless and will cost you interest

here i thought i would not ever answer a question on this site and boom first ten minutes   first and foremost i am in the automotive industry specifically one of our core is finance department management consulting and the sales process both for the sale of the care as well   as   the financial transaction first and foremost new vehicle gross profits are nowhere near 20 for the dealership   in an entry level vehicle like say a toyota corolla there is only a   few hundreds of dollars in markup from invoice to   there is also something called that dealers get for achieving certain goals such as sales volume these are usually pretty easy to hit as a matter of fact i have never heard of a dealer not getting the hold back on a deal   this hold back is there to cover overhead for the car the cost of getting it ready to sell having a lot to park it on making it ready for delivery offset some of the cost of sales labor   etc   most dealerships consider the portion of the invoice to not be part of the deal when it comes to   negotiations   certain brands such as kia and chrysler have something called dealer cash these payouts are usually stepped according to volume and vary by dealer location past history how the guys at the factory feel that day and any number of combinations   then there is csi or customer service index payments these payments are usually made every 1/4 are on the parts statement not the sales doc and while they effect the dealers bottom line they almost never affect the sales managers or sales persons payroll so they are not considered a part of the cost of the car   they are however extremely important to   the dealer and this is   why after you have your new car they want you to bring in your survey for a free oil change or something   if you are going to give a bad survey they want to throw it away and not send it in if you are going to give a good survey they want to   make sure you fill it out correctly   this is because lets say they ask you on a scale of 1 10 how was your sales person and you put a 9 that is a failing score dumb i know but that is how every factory csi score system i have seen worked   according to nada the average new vehicle gross profit including hold back and dealer cash is around $   no where near 20   dealerships would love it if they made 20 on your new diesel at around $   one last thing there is something on the invoice called wholesale finance reserve   this is the amount of money the factory forwards to the dealership to offset the cost of financing vehicle on the floor plan so they can have it for you to look at before you buy   this is usually equal to around 3 months of interest and while you might buy a vehicle that has been on the lot for 2 days they have plenty that have been there much longer so this equals out in a fair to run store general that know what they are doing can make this really pad their net profit to statement on to incentives there are basically 3 kinds   cash to customer in the form of rebates dealer cash in the form of incentives to dealerships based on volume or the of a vehicle and incentive rates or leases   the rates are pretty self explanatory as they advertised as such example 0 for 60 months   leased are harder to figure out and usually not disclosed as they are hard to explain and also a source of increased profit   leases are usually powered by lower cost of money called a money factor think of it as an interest rate that is discounted from the lease company or a subsidized residual   subsidized are virtually on domestic vehicles due to their poor resell values   a subsidized residual works like this you buy a toyota camry and the automotive lease guide says it has a residual at 36 months of 48   well toyota motor credit says we will give you a residual of 60 basically subsidizing a 2 increase in residual   since they do not expect to be able to sell the car at auction for that amount they have to set aside the 2 as a future expense   what does this mean to you it means a lower payment   also a good rule of thumb if you are told a money factor by your salesperson to figure out what the interest rate is just multiply it by 2400   so if a money factor is give of you know your actual interest rate is a little bit lower than illustration purposes only money factors are much lower than that right now so how does this save you money well a lease is basically calculated by multiplying the msrp by the residual and then subtracting that amount from the capitalized cost which is the price paid for the car trade in + payoff + rebate down payment   that is the depreciation   then you divide that number by the term of the loan and you have the depreciation amount   so if you have 20 k cc and 10 k r your d = 10 k 36 = monthly payment   for the rest of the monthly payment you add i think been a long time since i did this with out a computer the residual plus the cc for $ 30,000 mf of = 107 for a total payment of 404 ish   this is not completely accurate but you can use it to   make sure a salesperson finance person is not trying to do one thing and   say another as so often happens on leases 0 how the   heck do   they make money at that well its simple   first in 2008 the fed made all the captive lenders into actual banks instead of whatever they were before   so now they have access to the fed 's discounting window which with todays monetary policies make it almost free money   in the past these lenders had to go through all kinds of hoops to raise funds and   securitize loans even for super prime credit   those days are essentially over   now they get their short term money just like bank of america does   eventually they still bundle these loans and sell them   so in the short term you pay for the 0 by giving up part or all of your rebate   this is really important do not give up your rebate for 0 unless it makes sense to do so   when you can get the money at 2.5 and get a $ rebate customer cash on that or 0 take the cash   first of all make the finance guy gal show you the the difference in total cost they can do do this using the federal truth in lending disclosures on a finance contract   secondly how long will you keep the vehicle   if you come out ahead by say $ 1500 by taking the lower rate but you usually trade out every three years this is not going to work   also and this is important if you are involved in a situation with a total loss like a stolen car or even worse a bad wreck before the breakeven point you lose that price break   finally on judging what is right for you just know that future value of the vehicle on for resell or trade in will take into effect all of these past rebates and value the car accordingly   so if a vehicle depreciates 20 a year for the first 3 years the starting point will essentially be $ less than you actually paid   using rough numbers how does this help the dealers and car companies   well while a dealer struggles to make money on new cars the factory makes all of their money on the   new cars and the new car financing   while your individual loan might lose money that money is offset by the loss of rebate and i think ford does actually pay ford motor credit company the difference in the rate   the most important thing is what happens later now has 2500 loans with people with perfect credit   they can now use those loans to with people with not so perfect credit that they financed at and buy that money with interest rates in the range   well that is a hell of a lot of profit   how does it help the dealership well the more super prime credit they have in their portfolio the more subprime credit the banks will buy for them   this means they have more loans originated that are more profitable for them   say you come in for the 0 but have 590 credit score they get to buy the deal because they have a good portfolio and you win because the dealer gets to buy the money at say 9 and sell it to you at say 12 making the spread   you win there because you actually qualified for a rate of around 18 with a subprime company like santander or capital one yes that capital one so   you save a ton on your overall cost of the car any dealership that is half way well run makes as much or money in the finance and insurance office than the rest of the dealership   when you factor in what a good director can do to get deals done with favorable terms that really goes up   think about that the guys sitting a desk drinking coffee making more than the   service department guys all put together well that was long winded but there i broke down the car business for whoever read this far

lower fees are always better everything else equal a lower fee makes your transaction overall a better deal all else equal   other transactions costs like the sec fee on sales are mostly the same across brokers and there is unlikely to be any difference in execution quality either   when comparing brokers be sure to consider the other issues to me most of these are minor issues   for that reason i 'd say let transaction cost be your guide i hear a lot of talk about the quality of the interface   if you just want to buy or sell a stock they are all pretty easy   some brokers have better tools for monitoring the market or looking at technical indicators if you are into that

as best as i can understand your payout is based on your which    is also capped at that same $ 118,500 so trump 's payout should also be    equivalently small exactly proportional to this cap not sure what you want from bernie here but that is correct is it accurate to say that trump will be paid by social security as    though his actual income was $ 118,500 rather than his full income assuming trump does pay that much depends on how much of his income is actually subject to the fica se tax yes it is accurate however i believe what confuses you is the point bernie sanders made about people getting the same benefit while being rich bernie 's point was that trump and the likes do n't need the social security income while they 're still getting it social security is designed at least theoretically to be the safety net for people of age who can not provide for themselves thus it is not supposed to be you get what you paid system this is a political discussion though social security system by definition is based on a major principle of any socialist society we as a group should support those who can not support themselves thus bernie 's point is that we should n't support trump and the likes at all since they do n't need that money but they should still pay the tax to allow supporting those who do need but can not pay in

why is the stock trading at only $ 5 per share the share price is the perceived value of the company by people buying and selling the stock not the actual value of the company and all its assets generally if the company is not doing well there is a perceived risk that it will burn out the money fast there is a difference between its signed conditional sale and will get money and has got money so in short it 's trading at $ 5 a share because the market does n't feel like it 's worth $ 12 per share quite a few believe there could be issues faced i.e. it may not make the $ 12 or there will be additional obligations i.e. employees may demand more layoff compensation etc or the distribution may take few years due to regulatory and legal hurdles the only problem is the stock exchange states if the company has no core business the stock will be suspended soon hopefully they can release the $ 12 per share first what will happen if i hold shares in the company the stock gets suspended and its sitting on $ 12 per share can it still distribute it out every country and stock markets have laid out procedures for de listing a company and closing a company the company can give $ 10 as say dividends and remaining later or as part of the closure process the company will distribute the balance among shareholders this would be a long drawn process

of course you 've already realized that some of that is that smaller estates are more common than larger estates   but it seems unlikely that there are four times as many estates between $ 10 and $ 11 million as above that range    people who expect to die with an estate subject to inheritance tax tend to prepare    i do n't know how common it is but if the surviving member of a couple then the new spouse gets a separate exemption   and of course spouses inherit from spouses without tax   in theory this could last indefinitely   in practice it is less likely   but if a married couple has $ 20 million the first spouse could leave $ 15 million to the second and $ 5 million to other heirs   the second spouse could leave $ 10 million to a third spouse after and another $ 5 million to children with the first spouse   all without triggering the estate tax    people can put some of their estate into a trust   this can allow the heirs to continue to control the money while not paying inheritance tax   supposedly ford of ford motor company took that route    another common strategy is to give the maximum without gift tax each year   that 's at least $ 14k per donor and recipient per year   so a married couple with two kids can transfer $ 56k per year   plus $ 56k for the kids spouses   and if there are four grandchildren that 's another $   great grandchildren count too   that 's more than a million every five years   so given ten years to prepare parents can transfer $ 2 million out of the estate and to the heirs without tax    consider the case of two wealthy siblings   they 've each maxed out their gifts to their own heirs   so they agree to max out their gifts to their sibling 's heirs   this effectively doubles the transfer amount without tax implication    also realize that they can assets at the current market rate   so if a rich person has an asset that is currently undervalued it may make sense to transfer it immediately as a gift   this will use up some of the estate exemption   but if you 're going to transfer the asset eventually you might as well do so when the value is optimal for your purpose    these are just the easy things to do   if someone wants they can do more complicated things that make it harder for the irs to track value    for example the bezos family invested in amazon.com when jeff bezos was starting it   as a result his company could survive capital losses that another company might not   the effect of this was to make him rich and his parents richer than they were   but he wo n't pay inheritance tax until his parents actually transfer the estate to him and i believe they actually put it in a charitable trust   if his company had failed instead he still would have been supported by the capital provided by his parents while it was open e.g. his salary   but he would n't have paid inheritance tax on it    there are other examples of the same pattern   fred smith of fedex donald trump bill gates of microsoft etc   the prime value of the estate was not in its transfer but in working together while alive or through a family trust   the child 's company became much more valuable as a result of a parent 's wealth   and in two of those examples the child was so successful that the parent became richer as a result   so the parent 's estate does count   meanwhile another company might fail leaving the estate below the threshold despite a great deal of parental support    and those are n't even   those children started real companies and offered their parents real investment opportunities   a family that wants to do so can do a lot more with arrangements   of course the irs may be looking for some of them    the point being that the estate might be more than $ 11 million earlier but the parents can find ways to reduce it below the inheritance tax exemption by the time that they die

if you are looking at long term investments then you can look to dheer 's answer and see that it does n't matter whether the money is large or small the return will be the same   when it comes to shorter term investments it can actually pay to be a smaller investor consider a stock that may not be trading in high volume if i want to take a position for 2,000 shares i can probably buy it quite quickly without moving the market considerably   if i was managing your hypothetical portfolio opening a position for 1,000,000 shares it can cause the price to go up significantly because i have to execute the order very carefully in order to not tip my hand to the market that i want a million shares   algorithmic traders will see the volume increasing on those shares and will raise their asking price high speed traders and market makers will also cause a lot of purchasing overhead then later when it comes time to sell i will lose a percentage to the price drop as i start flooding the market with available shares

ianal or an accountant but there is a useful notion of technical insolvency which you it sounds like you probably meet and which is a distinct concept from actual insolvency couple of choice quotes from that link if a company or person is technically insolvent that merely means    that it has a negative net asset value its liabilities are greater    than its assets    the significance of technical insolvency depends on circumstances it    may be an indicator of serious problems that may lead to actual    insolvency or it may be perfectly acceptable a technically insolvent company is free to keep trading as long as the    directors reasonably believe that the company will be able to pay its    debts and again as long as an creditor does not use the    courts to force a liquidation which is basically what @keshlam 's comment on your question is saying

there are situations where you can be forced to cover a position particular when reg sho regulation sho is activated reg sho is intended to make naked short sellers cover their position it is to prevent abusive failure to delivers where someone goes short without borrowing someone else 's shares naked shorting is n't a violation of federal securities laws but it becomes an accounting problem when multiple people have claims to the same underlying assets i 've seen companies that had 120 of their shares sold short too funny fwiw the market was correct as the company was worth nothing you can be naked short without knowing it so there can be times when you will be forced to cover other people being forced to cover can result in a short squeeze a risk the other downside is that you have to pay interest on your borrowings you also have to pay the dividends to the owner of the shares if applicable in shorter time frames these are negligible but in longer time frames such as closer to a year or longer these really add up let alone the costs of the market going in the opposite direction and the commissions

for me the emergency fund is meant to cover unexpected but necessary expenses that i did n't budget for   the emergency fund allows me to pay for these things without going into debt let 's say that my car breaks down and i do n't have any money in my budget for fixing it   i really need to get my car fixed so i spend the money from my emergency fund however cars break down periodically   if i was doing a better job with my budget i would allocate some money each month into a car repair maintenance category in fact i actually do this   with my budgeting software i can look at how much i 've spent on car repairs over the last year and budget a monthly amount for car repair expenses   even if i do this i might end up short if i am unlucky   emergency fund to the rescue if i 'm budgeting correctly i do n't pay any regular bills out of this fund as those are expected expenses   car insurance life insurance and property tax are all bills that come on a regular basis and i set aside money for each of these each month so that when the bill comes i have the money ready to go the recommended size of an emergency fund is usually listed as 3 to 6 months of expenses   however that is just a rough guideline   as you get better with your budget you might find that you have a lower probability of needing it and you can let your emergency fund fall to the lower end of the guideline range   the size of my own emergency fund is on the lower end of this scale and if i have a true crisis i.e. extended unemployment severe family medical event i can rob one of my other savings funds such as my car replacement fund vacation fund etc do n't be afraid to spend your emergency fund money if you need it   if you have an unexpected necessary expense that you have not budgeted for use the emergency fund money   however your goal should be to get to the point where you never have to use it because you have adequately accounted for all of the expenses that you can reasonably expect to have in the future

what you charge them depends on what kind of use you want them to have of the house   your use of the term roommate implies you 're imagining well a roommate type situation where everyone has full access to all common areas   this is the usual situation when multiple people jointly rent a house that none of them owns   in this situation all the roommates are essentially equals but if you own the house and are renting it out you can do whatever you want   a lot of people would not look for roommates but for or tenants you rent one room to a person and you decide what the terms are for their use of the rest of the house   that means you get to decide if when they use the kitchen if when they get to use your dishes what they can do in the back yard etc   in this situation the roommates are not your equals   you own the property and you set the terms for everyone else   to clarify after reading the other answer by not your equals i do n't mean to imply that renters are n't equal as human beings to the landlord or should be treated as lowly peasants or anything like that   i just mean that they need not have equal decision making powers with regard to the housing itself i would say the big difference is the social dynamic personally i would n't feel comfortable renting out rooms to roommates unless i was quite sure i would get along with them basically the kind of people i would actually rent with not just rent to if you do rent roommate style and everyone has essentially equal access to all the facilities of the house i 'd say it 's reasonable to split all house expenses roughly equally with perhaps some adjustments for differences in amenities like if one person has a larger bedroom than others   if you rent tenant style where you 're not expecting them to be your buddies the best way to determine a reasonable rent is to find other people renting similar rooms and see how much they 're charging   craigslist is a great way to do that you can also ask around to people you know

there are probably 3 4 questions here   diversification a good index a low cost s&p fund or etf can serve you very well if you add an extended market index or just go with total market that might be it for your stock allocation i 've seen people with 5 funds and it did n't take much analysis to see the overlap was so significant that the extra 4 funds added little and 2 of the 5 would have been it if you diversify by buying more etfs or funds be sure to see what they contain   if you can go back in time buy apple google amazon etc and do n't sell them individual stocks are fun to pick but unless you put in your homework are tough to succeed at you need to be right at the buy side and again to know if and when to sell i bought apple for example long ago pre last few splits but using responsible a approach i sold a bit each time it doubled has i kept it all through the splits i 'd have $ instead of the current $ 200 k or so of stock can you tell which companies now have that kind of potential for the future   the s&p has been just about double digit over 60 years the average managed fund will lag the s&p over time many will be combined with other funds or just close even with huge survivor bias managed funds ca n't beat the index over time on average aside from a small portion of stocks i 've picked i 'm happy to get s&p less .02 in my 401(k in aggregate people actually do far worse due to horrific timing and some odd thing called emotions

one reason this happens is due to dividends if the dividend amount is greater than the time value left on a call it can make sense to exercise early to collect the dividend   deep in the money puts also may get exercised early there 's usually little premium on a deep in the money put and the spread on the bid ask might erase what little premium there is if you have stock worth $ 5,000 but own puts on them that will give you $ 50,000 upon exercise and no spread to worry about the interest you can gain on the $ 50k might be more than the little to no time value left on the position even at several weeks to expiration

the reason to put more money down or accept a shorter maximum term is because the bank the deal or fails to sour it in some fashion   for example typically if there is less than 20 down you have to pay an premium called private mortgage insurance which makes it bad deal but i see banks offering the same rate for a mortgage as for a 30-year one and i think fools and their money   take the 30-year and if you feel like it pay more every month   although why you would feel like it i do n't know since it 's very difficult to get that money back if you need it

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

to answer your question briefly net income is affected by many things inside and outside of management control and must be supplemented by other elements to gain a clear picture of a company 's health to answer your question in depth we must look at the history of financial reporting initially accounting was primarily cash based that is a business records a sale when a customer pays them cash and records expenses when cash goes out the door this was not a perfectly accurate system as cashflow might be quite erratic even if sales are stable collection times may differ etc to combat problems with cash based accounting financial reporting moved to an accrual based system an accrual is the recording of an item before it has fully completed in a cash transaction for example when you ship goods to a customer and they owe you money you record the revenue then you record the future collection of cash as a balance sheet item rather than an income statement item another example if your landlord charges you rent on december 31st for the past year then in each month leading up to december you accrue the expense on the income statement even though you have n't paid the landlord yet accrual based accounting leaves room for accounting manipulation enron is a prime example among other things they were accruing revenue for sales that had not occurred this accelerated their income by having it recorded years before cash was ever collectible there are specific guidelines that restrict doing things like this but management will still attempt to accelerate net income as much as possible under accounting guidelines public companies have their financial statements audited by unrelated accounting firms theoretically they exist to catch material in the financial statements finally some items impacting profit do not show up in net income they show up in other comprehensive income oci oci is meant to show items that occurred in the year but were outside of management control for example changes in the value of foreign subsidiaries due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or changes in the value of company pension plan which are impacted by the stock market however while oci is meant to pick up all non management caused items it is a grey area and may not be 100 representative of this idea so in theory net income is meant to represent items within management control however given the grey area in accounting interpretation net income may be accelerated and it also may include some items that occurred by some random business fluke outside of company control finally consider that financial statements are prepared months after the last year end so a company may show great profit for 2015 when statements come out in march but perhaps jan march results are terrible in conclusion net income is an attempt at giving what you want an accurate representation of the health of a company in terms of what is under management control however it may be inaccurate due to various factors from malfeasance to incompetence   that 's why other financial measures exist as another way to answer the same question about a company 's health to see if those answers agree ex say net income is $ 10 m this year but was only $ 6 m last year great it went up by $ 4 m but now assume that accounts receivable shows $ 7 m owed to the company at dec 31 when last year there was only $ 1 m owed to the company that might imply that there are problems collecting on that additional revenue perhaps revenue was recorded prematurely or perhaps they sold to customers who went bankrupt   unfortunately there is no single number that you can use to see the whole company different metrics must be used in conjunction to get a clear picture

agree 100 with every post you made in this thread with a caveat   the traditional internet consumer advertiser provider model is heading to an existential crisis we have total information overload most people do n't even use facebook ads once through their whole facebook career google the originator of the model has its adwords roots   i do n't think we 'll actually pay for shows we 're way too cheap to do that but advertising is going to need to be revolutionized if it can maintain the status quo   completely misses the point it 's not about computer screens vs. tv 's it 's not tv vs internet the fundamental conflict is in the changing revenue flow in shows and movies i do n't care for season if hulu has them tomorrow when i have more time because these shows are paid for by advertisers providers must change their source of revenue or come up with new ways to entice consumers

you should plan 1 3 months for an emergency fund   saving 6 months of expenses is recommended by many but you have a lot of goals to accomplish and youth is impatient   early in your life you have a lot of building saving that you need to do you can find a good car for under $ 5000   it might take some effort and you might not get quite the car you want but if you save for 5 6 months you should have a decent car   my son is a college student and bought a sedan earlier this year for about $ 4000 onto the house thing   as you said at $ 11,000 expenses yearly plus about $ 10,000 saved you are making low 30 's   using a common rule of thumb of 25 for housing you really can not afford more than about $ 600 for housing you probably want to wait on that first house for awhile down payments really should be about 20 and depending upon the area of the country a modest house might be $ 120,000 or $   even on a $ 120,000 the 20 down payment would be $ 24,000 as you have student loans $ 20,000 you should put together a plan to pay them off perhaps allocating half your savings amount to paying down the student loans and half to saving as you are young you should have strong salary gains in the first few years and once you are closer to $ you might find the numbers working better for housing my worry is that you are spending $ 22,000 out of about $ for living expenses   that you are saving is great and you are putting aside a good amount   but you want to target saving 30 40 if you can

shorting stocks borrowing the shares to sell now then buying them back when the price drops   risk if you are wrong the stock can go up and if there are a lot of people shorting the stock you can get stuck in a short squeeze   that means that so many people need to buy the stock to return the ones they borrowed that the price goes up even further and faster   also whoever you borrowed the stock from will often make the decision to sell for you put options risk put values do n't always drop when the underlying price of the stock drops this is because when the stock drops volatility goes up and volatility can raise the value of an option and you need to check each stock for whether or not these options are available lists whether a stock is optional or not and for shorting you also need to find a broker that owns shares that they are willing to lend out

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

invest because you are young and have lots of time i recommend opening an investment account and putting most 1000 £ or all in something like an s&p 500 index fund or etf start building   your savings now because compound growth over time will build significant wealth you can still invest the other in something a bit less volatile if you think you 'll need the money in < 5 years if you expect your income to continue to grow and you expect to have extra cash every month for the foreseeable future i 'd just put it all in an index fund you can weather any temporary market swings and in the worst case scenario you can always sell a few shares if you need the cash the advantage of an index fund is that it has very low fees and it 's an invest and forget approach you do n't have to watch the market every day because your money will simply match the market and in the long term the market does much better than most managed funds or etfs
# 426559
could someone please explain to me how interest rates work i like to think of interest rates as the price of money it is specified as a percentage paid per unit of time for example to figure out how much interest money you get or have to pay for a given amount and time multiply the amount with the interest rate and then divide by the time divided by the interest rate 's specified time that sounds awfully complicated so let 's look at a simple example instead you deposit $ 1,000 at a fixed interest rate of 2 per year for two and a half years where the interest is paid at the end of the term this means that you earn $ 1,000 2 = $ 20 per year in interest multiply this by 2.5 years year = 2.5 and you will have received $ 20 2.5 = $ 50 in interest over 2.5 years if the interest is paid yearly this gets slightly more complicated but the principle is the same now imagine that you deposit $ 5,000 at a fixed 3 per year for half a year again the interest is paid at the end of the term you now earn $ 5,000 3 per year 0.5 years year = $ 75 in interest over six months variable interest rates makes this a little more complicated but it is exactly the same thing in principle calculate the interest paid for each period taking any compounding into account then add up all periods to get the total amount of interest paid over time it also works the same way if you take out a loan rather than depositing money tax effects capitals gains taxes or interest expense deductions may make the actual amount paid or received different but that does not change the fundamental aspect of how to calculate interest do cd 's make more money with higher interest rates or is it the other way around usually fixed interest rate instruments such as certificates of deposit or loans with fixed rates pay a higher interest rate for longer terms this is because it is harder to judge credit risk in a longer term so whoever gives the loan usually wants a premium for the additional risk so a 6-month cd will normally pay a smaller percentage interest per year than a five year cd note that this is not always the case the technical term for when this does not hold is inverted yield curve interest rates are almost always formally specified in terms of percent per year which makes it easy to compare rates if you buy a $ 100 6-month cd paying 1 i told you these were only examples and then reinvest the money at the end of the term in another 6-month cd also paying 1 the total amount paid will be $ 100 1 + 1 = $ for the first term then $ 1 + 1 = $ at the end of the second term as you can see the compounding of the interest makes this return slightly more than a single $ 100 12-month cd $ 100 1 + 1 = $ 101 but unless you are dealing with large amounts of money the difference is small enough to be negligible if you were to put $ 100 in a 2 one year cd you 'd get back $ 102 at the end of the year put the same amount in a 5 one year cd and you get back $ 105 so yes higher interest rates means more interest money paid for loans as well as deposits keep in mind that loans and deposits really are essentially the same thing and interest calculations work the same way for both the interest rate of a normal certificate of deposit does not change if the variable interest rates change but rather is locked in when the money is deposited or the cd is bought whichever way you prefer to look at it

there is no standard way to divide property under these circumstances this is why lawyers recommend agreeing how property will be divided up front and why they make so much money sorting out issues like this when couples divorce incidentally you do n't say which country you are in but in many countries if you have lived together for five years your breakup can be treated like a divorce legally speaking if you ca n't agree on how to divide the property the courts will be involved you are faced with a choice either find some way to come to an agreement you can both accept or hire lawyers and argue it out in court you might want to consider finding someone to act as mediator who will help you to come to an agreement professional services exist or you could consider a person you both respect and with the skills to do this

i am a believer in that theory my opinion is that over the long term we can expect 25 of income to reflect the payment on one 's mortgage and if you drew a line over time reflecting the mortgage this represents plus the downpayment you 'd be very close to a median home price the bubble that occurred was real but not as dramatic as schiller 's chart implies $ 1000 will support a $ k 30yr mortgage but $ k at 4 this is with no hype and exact same supply demand pressures   the market cap of all us companies adds to about $ the total wealth in the us about $ of course us stocks are n't just held by us citizens it 's a big world   let me suggest two things the world is poor in comparison to much of the us a $ 100,000 net worth puts you in the top 8 in the world the implication of this is that as the poorer 90 work their way up from poverty money will seek investments and there 's room for growth   even if you looked at a closed system the us only the limit absent bubbles would be one that would have to put a cap on productivity in today 's dollars we produce more than we did years ago and less than we will in the future we invent new things faster than the old ones are so any that our $ 18 t market can grow to say $ 30 t does not need to discuss p es or bubbles but rather the creation of new products and businesses that will increase the total market   to summarize   population growth not really discussed productivity and long term reduced poverty will all keep that boundary to be a growing number   that said this question may be economic and not pf in which case my analysis is bound for the off topic barrel fascinating question

crude is a cash settled blend of oman and dubai crude oil both quoted in usd   the daily settlement price is mark to market but the final settlement price is based on reported prices from dubai and oman or calculated in some cases with a known procedure averaged and then converted to yen using monthly average exchange rates as published by a reference bank see detailed rules you 're trying to go all the way back and quotes into a blend of usd quoted oils   the correct procedure here would be to go with the oman and dubai prices in the first place unless you 're trying to arbitrage the market as to why they do it this way   it 's a service   takes on all the challenges to provide customers with a steady and consistent way of trading cash oil   for physical oil all you 'd have to do is buy the blend on dubai 's and oman 's spot market   you trust 's price finding process i.e. there will be no discrepancies between your cash oil and the middle east physical oil edit as to why japan is n't buying wti directly   there 's a considerable cost of carry   wti delivery location is ok there are pipelines but it 's still a logistics act to get the oil to a port on the west coast and then have it shipped to japan   dubai 's delivery is at ali persian gulf crude can be shipped straight from al   not only is it a shorter trip but also there are more shipping companies specialised in oil deliveries to the asian why they pay in usd   persian oil is highly sought after in nearly all of asia 's economies but there 's little other exported goods from there   so naturally the market for currency crosses etc is not that liquid   at least not as liquid as to make buying persian oil a smooth deal   anyway both dubai and oman chose to follow western practice to quote their contracts in usd and maybe because of liquidity concerns also to accept usd for payment only

two typical responses to articles surveys making such claims   1 people use other forms of asset for emergency savings because interest rates are low clearly false   2 people use other forms of saving than a saving account therefore such surveys as the x% ca n't handle a $ 500 emergency are wrong on their face this is false the vast majority use a savings account   i 've chosen a topic that absolutely annoys the shit out of me every time it comes up how people save their money every time this topic comes up about x% of americans ca n't come up with $ y dollars in an emergency or have less than $ z in savings someone inevitably in with the linked response i have never seen anyone attempt to source their hand waving response beyond their own anecdote which is usually a thinly veiled brag about how financially savvy they are with their wealth perhaps people who have no assets or crippling debt do n't go out of their way to brag about it   i could link multiple reddit posts making a similar response which i address with my own stock response about once every 1 2 months instead i 've decided to expand with data from several other sources this is the good bad research problem if you 're asserting something but qualify your statement with sure we 'd find if we looked into then you 're doing it wrong a good researcher or journalist does n't put bullshit like that in their work because it 's their job to actually look for sources of data data which should exist with multiple government and independent groups so let 's get started all data as recent as i could find oldest source is for 2010   most americans do n't invest in the stock pubs   about of americans owned publicly traded stock directly or indirectly with a much smaller percent owning stock directly   pages 18 and 16 respectively it 's important to note the of indirect ownership which suggests this is mostly retirement accounts it 's entirely possible people are irresponsible with their emergency savings but i think it safe to say we should not expect people to dip into their retirement accounts for relatively minor emergency expenses the reason is obvious even if it covers the expense they now have to make up the shortfall for their retirement savings this is further supported by the same source   gt;"the value of assets held within iras and dc plans are among the most significant of many balance sheets and are a significant determinant of their future retirement security   page 20 pdf page 20 of 41   there is also a break down of holdings by asset type on page 16 pdf page 16 of 41   this data is skewed by the top 10 who keep more of their wealth in different asset power for a breakdown between the 1st 10th and percentiles see table 3   so far it seems pretty hard to maintain a large percent of americans have their wealth stored outside of savings accounts mattresses aside   here 's my original reply as to the breakdown of americans assets by type and percent a note this assumes people have assets source for images people wealth data   most people use savings accounts with runner up falling to checking accounts this will into our next topic which is the problem of unbanked underbanked households   a large number of individuals have no assets breaking down by asset types assumes people have assets in the first   to quote the fdic   from the 2015 survey indicate that percent of households in the united states were unbanked in 2015 this proportion represents approximately million households an additional 19.9 percent of u.s. households million were underbanked meaning that the household had a checking or savings account but also obtained financial products and services outside of the banking system   that 's right there are millions of households so finance savvy they do n't even have bank accounts obviously it 's because of low interest rates also most people have a checking account as well as savings account the percent with checking and savings was while those with checking only were page 25 pdf page 31 of 88 it 's possible in some surveys people keep all their money in checking but given other data sources and the original claim this fails to hold up if the concern was interest rates it makes no sense to keep money in checking which seldom pays interest   this survey also directly addresses the issue of emergency savings   gt overall percent of households saved for unexpected   expenses or emergencies in the past 12 months page 37 pdf page 43 of 88   furthermore   7.2 shows that among all households that saved for   unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts   were the most used savings method followed by checking   accounts more than four in five percent kept savings   in one of these accounts about one in ten 10.5 percent   households that saved maintained savings in the home or   with family or friends    emphasis added   why do n't people have wealth in different asset classes well they do n't save wp content rates by wealth   this is further supported by the oecd data   americans currency and deposits are 13 vs 5.8 for securities and other shares as of total financial household financial   additionally   interest earning checking accounts of american households second a   among all households that saved for unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts were the most used   savings method followed by checking accounts page 7 pdf page 13 of   saved for an emergency with a savings account vs who used checking   in fairness the fdic link does state banked americans were more likely to hold checking accounts than savings accounts 98 vs respectively but that does n't mean they 're earning interest in their checking account it 's also worth noting median transaction account value was for 2013 this is the federal reserve data $ 4100

the mortgage is a debt and you pay interest on it typically more than you can earn elsewhere especially once taxes are taken into account by lowering the principal you lower the total interest you pay this is true whether you sell the house after 1 year 10 years or 100 years in your case prepayments made in the next few years would mean that when you sell your mortgage principal would be lower than it otherwise would have been and your house equity will be higher you can therefore either move up to more house for the same monthly payment or have a lower monthly payment for the same kind of house either of those are good things right now is the easiest time to find a little more money so do it if you can later you will have more obligations and develop a taste for more expensive things statistically speaking and therefore find a few hundred a month much harder to come by

i can see apprenticeships making a comeback   i know of very few apprenticeships these days i 'm guessing most of them were replaced way back with certifications   the most obvious one is tattoo artists    to actually work at a tattoo place of business not a house basement you must serve for a year under someone who is a legitimate experienced tattoo artist   you will make half of what the tattoo is priced and the person getting the tattoo is well informed of who is doing the tattoo sometimes they get a discount because of it    after a year you are certified and can begin working by yourself and setting your own rates with a portion going to the business you usually rent a room in a tattoo shop    i 'm sure these standards vary depending on where you are but with economics turning the way they are i think apprenticeships can cover some of the downturn we are experiencing i 'm not sure how much it would cover but it would cover something however small   it also weeds out any who are n't serious and might otherwise produce terrible results

how do you know the shares will go up after you buy the ultimate risk in your scenario is that you buy at a peak and then that peak is never reached again over time stock markets go up more or less because there is a net increase in the overall production of the economy as time goes on however you wo n't experience much of that gain because you will be selling only after tiny amounts of profit have been achieved so your upside is low your plan is capital expensive because it requires you to have significant amount of cash available to make the initial purchase and your downside though unlikely has massive risk

many people have provided very good answers to this question and all the answers provide sound advice and justification below are some of my thoughts on the questions that you have put forward 1 the investment manager question the returns on your capital for a half year has been quite low having said that some investments do take more than half year to show some growth you could try talking to your investment manager and ask where your money has been deployed and why the returns are low if there are no real explanation given forth which would be more likely as you have mentioned your investment manager does not like to discuss your money with you you should pete 's advice and take all your money from investment manager and park it in the bank till you figure out what to do next with it 2 finances are not my forte at 22 finance is forte it takes longer than that however having said that how do you know finance is actually not your forte being a computer science graduate you would be more than comfortable with the mathematics required for finance you may not have looked seriously at finance till now i assume by your statement once way to be certain about this would be self learning some good books have been above and there are online information courses and articles on the internet for example here you could give some spare time and explore if finance interests you or not 3 if finance interests you then consider the 30 k as your seed fund and take a small portion of it say 2 k and try out your hand at investing on your own in the instruments that you feel most comfortable and see how you fare you are young enough to take the risk rest of the money you could put in other low risk instruments that you have identified through self study 4 if finance does not interest you the probably you are better off with an investment manager as observed above it will take some time for you to identify him her 5 on returns as mentioned above different instruments produce returns differently however one question that is universally asked is how much return on an one expect you were expecting more than $ 12 on your investment it is a difficult question to answer as returns and investment needs depend on a persons financial goals and risk taking profile one way to have some measure is to take 15 20 years cagr of the stock index return and reduce it by 2 3 that is in many cases not all a reasonable return expectation in medium long term

personally i would a consider selling the car and replacing it with a cheaper one   if you only drive it once a month you are probably not getting much value from owning a nice car b move the car either current or replacement out to your parent 's place   the cost of a plane ticket is about the same as the cost of the garage and your parents would likely hold on to it for free assuming they live in the suburbs and parking is not an issue option b should lower your insurance costs very low annual mileage and at least you 'll get some frequent flier miles out of your $ 350 a month that being said this is a quality of life issue which means that there is n't going to be a firm answer    if you are 25 have little debt which you are paying off on time have an emergency fund and you are making regular contributions to your 401k you are certainly not being seriously irresponsible by owning a nice car   but you may decide that the $ 1000 a month could be better spent somewhere else

with a $ 40,000 payment there is a 100 chance that the owner will be claiming this as a business expense on their taxes   the irs and the state will definitely know about it and the risk of interest and penalties if it is not claimed as income make the best course of action to see a tax adviser because taxes will not be taken out by the property owner the tax payer should also make sure that the estimated $ 10,000 in federal taxes if they are in the 25 tax bracket does n't trigger other tax issues that could result in penalties or the need to file quarterly taxes next year this kind of extra income could also result in a change or an elimination of a health care subsidy a unexpected mid year   change could trigger the need to refund the subsidy received this year via the tax form next april

your employer 's matching contribution is calculated based on the dollar amounts you end up putting in the nature of your 401(k contribution whether pre tax or roth after tax doesn't matter with respect to how their match gets calculated and their match always goes into a pre tax account even if you are contributing after tax the onus is on you to choose a contribution amount that maximizes your employer match regardless of the nature of your contribution maximizing your employer match using roth after tax contributions will eat up more of your annual gross salary but as long as you are willing to do that then you wo n't leave free employer match money on the table roth after tax contributions do n't get the tax deduction inherent in a pre tax contribution the tradeoff is that you end up with less take home pay per period if you contribute the same number of dollars on a roth after tax basis to your 401(k as opposed to on a pre tax basis for instance to make a maximum $ 18,000 roth after tax contribution to a 401(k it 's going to cost you a lot more than $ 18,000 of your annual gross salary to net the same $ 18,000 number on the flip side the roth money is worth more in retirement than pre tax money because it wo n't be subject to taxes then however 401(k plan contribution amounts are almost always expressed as a percentage of gross salary i.e. in pre tax terms even when electing to make after tax contributions so when electing after tax one is implicitly accepting that the contribution will cost more than the percentage of gross salary because you 'll need to pay the tax on a gross amount that would yield the same number of dollars but as an after tax amount

i may be underestimating your knowledge of how exchanges work if so i apologize   if not then i believe the answer is relatively straightforward lets say price of a stock at time t1 is 15 $   there are many types of price that an exchange reports to the public as discussed below let 's say that you 're referring to the most recent trade price   that is the last time a trade executed between a willing buyer and a willing seller was at $ 15.00 lets say a significant buy order of 1 m shares came in to the market here i believe might be a misunderstanding on your part   i think you 're assuming that the buy order must necessarily be requesting a price of $ 15.00 because that was the last published price at time t1   in fact orders can request any price they want   it 's totally okay for someone to request to buy at $ 10.00   presumably nobody will want to sell to him but it 's still a perfectly valid buy order but let 's continue under the assumptions that at t1 this makes the bid $ and the ask $ 15.00   nyse also publishes these prices there are n't enough people selling that stock it 's quite rare in major us equities for anyone to place a buy order that exceeds the total available shares listed for sale at all prices   what i think you mean is that 1 m is larger than the amount of currently listed sell requests at the ask of $ 15.00 so say of the 1 m only 100,000 had a matching sell order and others are waiting so this means that there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be sold at the ask of $ 15.00 and that all other sellers currently in the market told nyse they were only willing to sell for a price of $ 15.01 or higher   if there had been more shares available at $ 15.00 then nyse would have matched them this would be a trigger to the automated system to start increasing the price here is another point of misunderstanding i think   nyse 's automated system does not invent a new higher price to publish at this point   instead it simply reports the last trade price still $ 15.00 and now that all of the willing sellers at $ 15.00 have been matched nyse also publishes the new ask price of $ 15.01   it 's not that nyse has decided $ 15.01 is the new price for the stock it 's that $ 15.01 is now the lowest price at which anyone known to nyse is willing to sell   if nobody happened to be interested in selling at $ 15.01 at t1 but there were people interested in selling at $ then the new published ask would be $ instead of $ 15.01 not because nyse decided it but just because those happened to be the facts at the time similarly the new bid is most likely now $ 15.00 assuming the person who placed the order for 1 m shares did not cancel the remaining unmatched 900,000 shares of his her order   that is $ 15.00 is now the highest price at which anyone known to nyse is willing to buy how much time does the automated system wait to increment the price the frequency of the price change and by what percentage to increment etc so i think the answer to all these questions is that the automated system does none of these things   it merely publishes information about a the last trade price b the price that is currently the lowest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to sell and c the price that is currently the highest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to buy edit oh i forgot to answer your primary question can we estimate the impact of a large buy order on the share price not only can we estimate the impact but we can know it explicitly   because the exchange publishes information on all the orders it knows about anyone tracking that information can deduce that in this example there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be purchased at $ 15.00   so if a large buy order of 1 m shares comes in at $ 15.00 then we know that all of the people waiting to sell at $ 15.00 will be matched and the new lowest ask price will be $ 15.01 or whatever was the next lowest sell price that the exchange had previously published

this answer is based on australian tax which is significantly different i only offer it in case others want to compare situations in australia a popular tax reduction technique is negative gearing borrow from a bank buy an investment property if the income the new property is not enough to cover interest payments plus maintenance etc then the excess each year is a capital loss which you claim each year as an offset to your income ie pay less tax by the time you reach retirement the idea is to have paid off the mortgage you then live off the revenue stream in retirement or sell the property for a taxed lump sum

this is really unfortunate   in general you ca n't back date individual policies   you could have if it was available to you elected to extend your employer 's coverage via cobra for the month of may and possibly june depending on when your application was submitted then let the individual coverage take over when it became effective    groups have some latitude to retroactively cover and terminate employees but that 's not an option in the world of individual coverage the carriers are very strict about submission deadlines for specific effective dates   this is one of the very few ways that carriers are able to say no within the bounds of the aca   you submit an application you are assigned an effective date based on the date your application was received and subsequently approved   it has nothing to do with how much money you send them or whether or not you told them to back date your application if someone at the new york exchange told you you could have a retroactive effective date they should n't have many providers have financial hardship programs   you should talk to the er hospital and see what might be available to you   the insurer is likely out of the equation though if the dates of service occurred before your policy was effective regarding your 6th paragraph regarding having paid the premium   in this day and age carriers can only say no via administrative means   they set extremely rigid effective dates based on your application date   they will absolutely cancel you if you miss a payment   if you get money to them but it was after the grace period date even by one minute they will not reinstate you   if you 're cancelled you must submit a new application which will create a new coverage gap   you pay a few hundred dollars each month to insure infinity risk you absolutely have to cover your administrative bases because it 's the only way a carrier can say no anymore so they cling to it

the harvested losses are capital losses   see this irs page generally realized capital losses are first offset against realized capital gains   any excess losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if married filing separately on line 13 of form 1040   losses in excess of this limit can be carried forward to later years to reduce capital gains or ordinary income until the balance of these losses is used up this means that your harvested losses can be used to offset ordinary income up to $ 3000 in a single year and with extra losses carried forward to future years   it is pretty close to a free lunch provided that you have some losses somewhere in your portfolio this free lunch is available to anyone but for a human it can be quite a chore to decide when to sell what keep track of the losses and avoid the wash sale rules   the advantage of robo advisors is that they eat that kind of bookkeeping for breakfast so they can take advantage of tax loss harvesting opportunities that would be too cumbersome for a human to bother with

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

the irs no longer requires that employers submit all w4 forms but they can request a w4 for an employee at any time and putting false information on your w4 is still a punishable offense    i agree that having a return is like giving the treasury department an interest free loan for the year but unfortunately paying the appropriate amount of withholding tax is required    there is some ambiguous information regarding an employer adjusting the amount of withholding but it seems to mean that they can withhold more than the estimated rate but never less than what is calculated using the deductions on your w4 see the link for more details irs tax withholding

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

if you have wage income that is reported on a w2 form you can contribute the maximum of your wages what you can afford or $ 5500 in a roth ira    one advantage of this is that the nominal amounts you contribute can always be removed without tax consequences so a roth ira can be a deep emergency fund i.e. if the choice is $ 2000 in cash as emergency fund or $ 2000 in cash in a 2015 roth ira contribution choice 2 gives you more flexibility and optimistic upside at the risk of not being able to draw on interest gains until you retire or claim losses on your tax return   if you let april 15 2016 pass by without making a roth ira contribution you lose the 2015 limit forever   if you are presently a student and partially employed you are most likely in the lowest marginal tax rate you will be in for decades which utilizes the roth tax game effectively    if you 're estimating a few hundred then what you pick as an investment is going to be less important than making the contributions   that is you can pick any mutual fund that strikes your fancy and be prepared to gain or lose call it $ or pick a single stock and be prepared to lose it all   at some point you need to understand your emotions around volatility and the only tuition for this school is taking a loss and having the presence of mind to examine any panic responses you may have   no reason not to learn this on a few hundred   while it 's not ideal to have losses in a roth a few hundred is not consequential in the long run    if you 're not prepared at this time in your life for the possibility of losing it all or will need the money within a year or few as your edit suggests keep it in cash and try to reduce your expenses to contribute more   can you contribute another $ 100   you will have more money at the end of the year than investment choice will likely return

in general we 're getting a more nuanced view of a proposition that might tend to influence policy amazon creates jobs is the implicit suggestion of the headline and it 's worthwhile to take a critical approach rather than simply accepting it as something that should influence our opinions   letting the mayor open an refinery in the centre of town also creates jobs after all but people tend to have an intuitive grasp of the costs that it would impose on the as a whole   you to what i think is a fear of developed information   having learnt of the disadvantage of a growing amazon to potential employees as compared to the preceding status quo we proceed on the assumption that the growth of amazon is a sufficient explanation for the disruption of that status quo and naively assume that we need merely prevent amazon 's business model from succeeding in order to restore the world to rights without examining any of the possible harms of our own intervention   that 's certainly something i can sympathize with   however while creative destruction describes something that does indeed happen it 's a bad idea to observe destruction and assume that either the process or the outcome is necessarily creative   destructive destruction is also a thing and it is inherently cheaper and easier than the creative variety   disruptive business models often succeed simply because they use technology to bypass regulatory traps for good or for ill   at times however this involves the discovery of a way to offload the costs of the enterprise onto society     a wonderful example of this would be bike sharing systems   where i 've seen them in north america in their first generation they tend to have physical parking stations to which the bikes must be returned   in china by contrast systems have developed where one need n't even return the bicycles to any particular location   one merely finds one wherever someone had parked it and it by scanning the code on it   the bicycles themselves are not a huge capital cost so convenience relies on a huge oversupply of bikes that have been parked dumped dropped or hidden by their previous riders all over the public space   effectively these companies have managed to make the municipal services responsible for their inventory management

why do stock markets allow these differences in reporting the irs allows businesses to use fiscal calendars that differ from the calendar year there are a number of reasons a company would choose do this from preferring to avoid an accounting rush at end of year during holiday season to aligning with seasonality for their profits some like to have q4 as the strongest quarter smaller businesses may prefer to keep the extra stress of year end to a traditionally slower time for the business and some just start their fiscal calendar when the company starts up you 'll notice the report dates are a couple weeks after fiscal quarter end you would read it as three months ended so for three months ended october 31 2017 so august september october are their q4 months

yep there just is no free lunch   so called high dividend stocks are usually from companies that have stable cash flows but relatively little or moderate growth potential utility companies come to mind let 's take telecommunications as an example   such stocks usually indeed are considered more conservative in a bull market they wo n't make high jumps and in a bear market they should n't experience deep falls i mean just because the stock market fell by 10 you 're not going to stop using your phone the stock might suffer a bit but the divided is still yielding you the same however fundamental data can have a significant impact let 's say a recession hits the country of the people might not get the newest iphone and lock in to an expensive contract anymore they might use cheaper forms of communication they might stop paying bills go bankrupt etc this will have a severe impact on the company 's cash flow and thus hit the stock in a double whammy one the dividend is gone two the price will fall even further   there are basically two scenarios after that either the recession is temporary and your stock became a regular growth stock that at some point might bounce back and re establish at the previous levels or the economy has contracted permanently but regained stability in which case you will again have a stock with a high dividend yield but based on a lower price in conclusion high dividend stocks make sense in a portfolio but never consider their income to be safe reduce your risk by diversifying

two principles in comparing different scenarios   1 keep the two scenarios as equal as possible in amount and timing of payments   and 2 find the financial comparison at one particular point so your car loan $ 10,000 for 35 months at 8 compounded monthly means you 're paying $ suppose you make the switch and keep on paying the same mortgage and $ for the 35 months see 1 above those extra payments continued for 35 months at your mortgage rate of will pay off a mortgage of $ which will more than pay off the $ 10,000 you added to the mortgage   in other words making the switch will benefit you to the tune of as of the day of the switch   you could ask the mortgage company to give you the $ 10,000 and the $ and all your payments and amortization would stay the same see 2 above of course this is pretty much what joe taxpayer said

trying to figure out how much money you have available each day sounds like you 're making this more complicated than it needs to be unless you 're extremely tight and you 're trying to squeeze by day by day asking do i have enough cash to buy food for today and so on you 're doing too much work here 's what i do i make a list of all my bills some are a fixed amount every month like the mortgage and insurance premiums others are variable like electric and heating bills but still pretty predictable   most bills are monthly but i have a few that come less frequently like water bills in my area come every 3 months and i have to pay property taxes twice a year for these you have to calculate how much they cost each month like for the water bill it 's once every 3 months so i divide a typical bill by 3 always round up or estimate a little high to be safe groceries are a little tricky because i do n't buy groceries on any regular schedule and sometimes i buy a whole bunch at once and other times just a few things when groceries were a bigger share of my income i kept track of what i spent for a couple of months to figure out an average per month today i 'm a little richer and i just think of groceries as coming from my spending money i allocate a percentage of my income for contributions to church and charities and count this just like bills it 's a good idea to put aside something for savings and/or paying down any outstanding loans every month then i add these up to say okay here 's how much i need each month to pay the bills subtract that from my monthly income and that 's what i have for spending money i get paid twice a month so i generally pay bills when i get paid for most bills the due date is far enough ahead that i can wait the maximum half a month to pay it worst case the bill comes the day after i pay the bills from this paycheck   then i keep enough money in my checking account to a cover any bills until the next paycheck and allow for the particularly large bills and b provide some cushion in case i make a mistake forget to record a check or make an arithmetic error or whatever and c provide some cushion for short term unexpected expenses to be safe a should be the total of your bills for a month or as close to that as you can manage b should be a couple of hundred dollars if you can manage it more if you make a lot of mistakes if you 've calculated your expenses properly and only spend the difference keeping enough money in the bank should fall out naturally i think it 's a lot easier to try to manage your money on a monthly basis than on a daily basis most of us do n't spend money every day and we spend wildly different amounts from day to day most days i probably spend zero but then one day i 'll buy a new tv or computer and spend hundreds   update in response to question what i do in real life is this to calculate my available cash to spend i simply take the balance in my checking account assuming that all checks and electronic payments have cleared my mortgage is deducted from my checking every month so i post that to my checking a month in advance i pay a lot of things with automatic charges to a credit card these days so my credit card bills are large and ca n't be ignored so subtract my credit card balances subtract my reserve amount what 's left is how much i can afford to spend so for example say i look at the balance in my checkbook today and it 's say $ 3000 that 's the balance after any checks and other transactions have cleared and after subtracting my next mortgage payment then i subtract what i owe on credit cards let 's say that was $ 1,200 so that leaves $ 1,800 i try to keep a reserve of $ 1,500 that 's plenty to pay my routine monthly bills and leave a healthy reserve so subtract another $ 1,500 leaves $ 300 that 's how much i can spend i could keep track of this with a spreadsheet or a database but what would that gain the amount in my checking account is actual money any spreadsheet could accumulate errors and get farther and farther from accurate values i use a spreadsheet to figure out how much spending money i should have each month but that 's just to use as a guideline if it came to say $ 100 i would n't make plans about buying a new mercedes if it came to $ 5,000 a month than buying a fancy new car might be realistic it also tells me how much i can spend without having to carefully check balances and add it up these days i have a fair amount of spending money so when for example i recently decided i wanted to buy some software that cost $ 100 i just bought it with barely a second thought when my spending money was more like $ 100 a month lunch at a fast food place was a big event that i planned weeks in advance obviously i hope do n't get stupid about small amounts if you can easily afford $ 100 for an impulse purchase that does n't mean that you can afford $ 100 five times a day every day two caveats 1 it helps to have a limited number of credit cards so you can keep the balances under control i have two credit cards i use for almost everything so i only have two balances to keep track of i used to have more and it got confusing it was easy to lose track of how much i really owed which is a set up for getting in trouble

your calculations are good as far as they go but there are lots of other factors and pros and cons to each decision yes you should certainly compare the monthly rent to what your mortgage payments would be as you have done yes you should consider how long you might live there if you do move out how difficult will it be to sell the house given market conditions in your area if you try to rent it how difficult is it to find a tenant and what rent could you expect to receive speaking of moving out and renting the place who will manage the property and do maintenance would you still be close enough to do this yourself would you be willing and able to spend the time or would you have to hire someone also what if the tenant does not pay the rent how difficult is it to evict someone in your area speaking from personal experience i own a rental property in ohio and the law says you can evict someone with 3 days notice but in practice they do n't just leave so then you have to take them to court it takes months to get a court date and months longer before the police actually show up to order them out of the house and you have to pay the lawyer and court fees in that time they 're living in your property rent free in my case one tenant also totally trashed the place and stole everything that was n't nailed down i had to spend $ 13,000 on repairs to a house worth a fraction of what you 're talking about being a landlord is not just a matter of sitting back and collecting rent checks there 's a fair amount of work and a lot of risk what do you have to pay the realtor and what other closing costs would you have to pay where i live realtors typically charge 6 to 7 you may also have to pay for an appraisal title search and bunch of other little fees mortgage interest is deductible on your federal income taxes rent is not if you own and something needs to be repaired you have to pay for it if you rent the landlord has to pay for it   if you own you can do pretty much what you like with the property subject to zoning ordinances and building codes and maybe homeowners association rules but you should have a pretty good amount of leeway if you want to install ceiling fans or remodel the kitchen or add a deck it 's up to you if you 're renting it 's up to the landlord to decide what you can do to the property and if he agrees to let you do some upgrade when you 're done it belongs to him with a condo you are not usually responsible for exterior maintenance like mowing the lawn and trimming the and washing the outer walls with a house you are you might pay someone to do this which adds to the cost or you might do it yourself which takes time insurance on a condo or is much less than insurance on a house in my area anyway you should investigate those costs if you buy eventually you own the place and do n't have to pay a mortgage any more if you rent you continue to pay forever even if you do n't live in the same house forever as long as you do n't take a terrible loss when you sell you should then have some money left over to apply to the next house so you are still building equity some of these pros and cons are easily quantifiable others are probabilities like how likely is it that your water heater will fail and how long is it likely to take to find a buyer if you want to sell and others are pretty subjective

i think everyone else answered before you added the info about your car loan in your comment while it makes sense to pay off loans with the highest interest rate first keep in mind that in most cases you can deduct mortgage interest from your taxable income so the after tax rate of interest that you 're paying on your 8.6 second mortgage will be less than your 7 car loan assuming that your tax bracket is more than 18 federal and state combined if you plan to use your funds to pay down debt definitely attack the car loan first

yes the speed bump explicitly can not impact the reports to the sip two years ago this would not be a big deal because the sip was stupidly slow especially under load so you send your report to the sip faster than you publish your own market data feed and the sip just takes forever to publish meaning your own market data feed still gets to the clients first   now that the sip is fast this is no longer the case you still as an exchange have to publish to the sip first or within microseconds of at the same time but if you have some sort of artificial delay on your market data that is longer than the sip processing time the sip updates will arrive first doubly so if the consumers are with one of the sips   edit for what it 's worth matt has a pretty solid write up covering nyse american but it pertains to iex as american attack of   bats also comments on this phenomenon in their sec comment letter on nyse american see footnote 1 on the first comments sr pdf the link is somewhat recursive since it points back to another of 's posts but still just as accurate an assessment

it appears very possible that google will not have to pay any class c holders the settlement amount given the structure of the settlement   this is precisely because of the arbitrage opportunity you 've highlighted   this idea was mentioned last summer in as explained in a dealbook article the settlement requires google to pay the following amounts if one year from the issuance of the class c shares the value according to the following formula if the c share price is equal to or more than 1 percent but less than 2 percent below the a share price 20 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 2 percent but less than 3 percent below the a share price 40 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 3 percent but less than 4 percent below the a share price 60 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 4 percent but less than 5 percent below the a share price 80 percent of the difference if the c share price is equal to or more than 5 percent below the a share price 100 percent of the difference up to 5 percent if the class a shares trade around $ 450 after the split c issuance and the c shares trade at a 4.5 percent discount during the year or $ per share then investors expect a payment of 80 percent times $ 450 times 4.5 percent = $ the value of c shares would then be $ $ plus $ but if this is the new trading value during the year that ’s only a discount of less than 1 percent to the a shares so no payment would be made but if no payment is made we are back to the full discount and this continues ad infinitum in other words the value of a stock can be displayed as equity value + dividend value + voting value + settlement value = total share value if we ignore dividend and voting values and ignore premiums and discounts for risk and so forth then the value of a share is basic equity value plus anticipated settlement payoff   the google class c settlement is structured to reduce the payoff as the value   and the practice of arbitrage guarantees if you buy into at least semi strong emh that the price of c shares will be up by arbitrageurs that want the payoff the voting value of googl is effectively zero since the non traded class b shares control all company decisions   so the value of the class a googl voting is virtually zero for the time being   the only divergence between googl and goog price is dividends which i believe is supposed to be the same and the settlement payoff   somebody who places zero value on the vote and who expects dividend difference to be zero should always prefer to buy goog to googl until the price is equal disregarding the settlement so technically someone is better off owning goog if dividends are the same and market prices are equal just because the vote is worthless and the nonzero chance of a future settlement payoff is gravy the arbitrage itself is present because a share that costs as in the article $ is worth $ if the settlement pays out at that rate   the stable equilibrium is probably either just before or just after the threshold where the settlement pays off depending on how reliably arbitrageurs can predict the movement of goog and googl if i can buy a given stock for x but know that it 's worth x+1 then i 'm willing to pay up to x+1   in the google case the goog stock is worth where s is an uncertain settlement payment that could be zero or could be substantial   we have six tiers of s counting zero payoff so that the price is likely to follow a pattern from x to to x to x and climbing the tier ladder until it lands in the frontier between and   every time it jumps into people should be willing to pay that new amount for goog so the price moves out of payoff range and into where people will only pay x. i 'm actually simplifying here since technically this is all based on future expectations   so the actual price you 'd pay is expressed thus resale value of goog before settlement payoff = x + expectation that settlement payoff will pay 100 of difference = s5 expected nominal difference between goog and googl = d + s4 80 d + s3 60 d + s2 40 d + s1 20 d + 0 d   = price willing to pay for class c goog = p plus you 'd technically have to present value the whole thing for the time horizon since the payoff is in a year   note that i 've any voting dividend analysis into x.   it 's reasonable to thing that s5 s4 s3 and maybe s2 are nearly zero given the open arbitrage opportunity   and we know that times 0 of d is zero   so the real analysis again ignoring pv is thus p = x + which is a long way of saying what are the odds that goog will happen to be worth no more than 99 of googl on the payoff determination date

a few points that i would note call options could the bond be called away by the issuer this is something to note as some bonds may end up not being as good as one thought because of this option that gets used tax considerations are you going for corporate treasury or different ones may have different tax consequences to note if you are n't holding the bond in a tax advantaged account e.g roth ira ira or 401k convertible or not some bonds are known as since the bond comes with an option on the stock that can be worth considering for some kinds of bonds inflation protection some bonds like tips or series i savings bonds can have inflation protection built into them that can also be worth understanding in the case of tips there are principal adjustments while the savings bond will have a change in its interest rate default risk some of the higher yield bonds may have an issuer go under which is another way one may end up with equity in a company rather than getting their money back on the other side for some one could have the risk of the bond not quite being as good as one thought like some detroit bonds that may end up in a different result given their bankruptcy but there are also revenue bonds that may not meet their target for another situation that may arise some bonds may be insured though this requires a bit more research to know the credit rating of the insurer as for the latter question what if interest rates rise and your bond 's value drops considerably do you hold it until maturity or do you try to sell it and get something that has a higher yield based on face value

this page from the cra website details the types of investments you can hold in a tfsa you can hold individual shares including etfs traded on any designated stock exchange in addition to the other types of investment you have listed   here is a list of designated stock exchanges provided by the department of finance   as you can see it includes pretty well every major stock exchange in the developed world if your bank 's tfsa only offers mutual funds gics and saving deposits then you need to open a tfsa with a different bank or a stock company with an execution only service that offers tfsa accounts   almost all of the big banks will do this   i use hsbc invest direct and td though my tfsa 's are all with hsbc currently   you will simply provide them with details of your bank account in order to facilitate money transfers tfsa contributions since purchasing foreign shares involves changing your canadian dollars into a foreign currency one thing to watch out for when purchasing foreign shares is the potential for high foreign exchange spreads   they can be excessive in proportion to the investment being made   my experience is that hsbc offers by far the best spreads on fx but you need to exchange a minimum of $ 10,000 in order to obtain a decent spread typically between 0.25 and 0.5   you may also wish to note that you can buy unhedged etfs for the us and european markets on the toronto exchange   this means you are paying next to nothing on the spread though you obviously are still carrying the currency risk   for example an unhedged s&p500 trades under the code bmo unhedged or ishares unhedged in addition it is important to consider that commissions for trades on foreign markets may be much higher than those on a canadian exchange   this is not always the case   hsbc charge me a flat rate of $ for both toronto and new york trades but for london they would charge up to 0.5 depending on the size of the trade   some foreign exchanges carry additional trading costs   for example london has a 0.5 stamp duty on purchases edit one final thing worth mentioning is that in my experience   holding us securities means that you will be required to register with the us tax authorities and with those us exchanges upon which you are trading   this just means fill out a number of different forms which will be provided by your stock broker exchange registrations can be done electronically however us tax authority registration must be submitted in writing   dividends you receive will be net of us withholding taxes   i am not aware of any capital gains reporting requirements to us authorities

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

the simple answer is absolutely   with the parameters you quote if you will pay off the loan in 82 months or less you will be ahead taking the variable rate you have put your finger on the important question as well the higher initial interest is buying insurance against rates rising if you do n't pay off the loan within 82 months   i suspect the contract loan term is much longer than that because otherwise a variable rate does not make sense   you need to assess whether the insurance you are buying is worth the premium   you can look at what the formula for the variable rate would set the rate at today it is probably somewhat higher than the   that will tell you how much rates have to rise to make the variable rate go above note that if the loan term is around 160 months and it could well be 180 months 15 years you can afford the interest to rise to about 6.2 for the last half and you will still be dollars ahead   it could even rise higher if you discount expenses in the future   you could also hope that if inflation rises to make interest rates rise like that you will get cost of living raises that make this easy to pay

there are two things you need to keep in mind when you look at inflation as an entity inflation is necessary to keep in check the value of goods as per moore 's law for example a mobile phone that you buy for £ 100 today will be available for £ 50 in two years with increased purchasing power one needs to maintain balance between the purchasing power and its value if you think about the loss at a rate of 2 you would have £ in terms of today 's value in two years but if you looked at the same cell phone as leverage for your business where it allowed you to do work and earn £ 1000 in two years the investment would clearly offset the cost of inflation inflation is incentive for people to spend their money if you for example spent all of your £ 100 today it is £ 100 income for someone else he has further incentive to spend it creating a chain of transactions in theory while this is a true mathematical loss the increasing purchasing power helps you leverage your financial asset to get a return on your investment

have her pay something like a friendly monthly rent this should be less than half of the monthly mortgage cost since you are assuming the risk and benefits of a mortgage and closer to the rent of similar places near you for when you get married and she is to have half the apartment have a pre agreed way to calculate a lump sum that she needs to provide to match your own contributions up to that time as if you two had equal contributions from the beginning the financially precise way to do it would be to have her pay more than the mere sum of the amount since she will be providing the amount at a later time than you but i would be generous and skip this in your place if the difference is not too big if you break up she will have payed what would be a fair amount of rent as if you two were renting so in this sense it is fair that she would not have a claim on the apartment in case that you two would like that she keeps the apartment you can just sell it to her having her pay this same amount as above and assume responsibility for the rest of the mortgage

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

i 'll answer your question but first a comment about your intended strategy   buying government bonds in a retirement account is probably not a good idea   government bonds generally are tax advantaged themselves so they offer a lower interest rate than other types of bonds   at no tax or reduced tax many people will accept the lower interest rate because their effective return may be similar or better depending for example on their own marginal tax rate   in a tax advantaged retirement account however you 'll be getting the lower interest without any additional benefit because that account itself is already tax advantaged buying bonds generally may be a good idea or not i wo n't comment on that but choose a different category of bonds for the general question about the relationship between the fed rate and the bond rate they are positively correlated   there 's not direct causal relationship in the sense that the fed is not setting the bond rate directly but other interest bearing investment options are tied to the fed rate and many of those interest bearing options compete for the same investor dollars as the bonds that you 're reviewing   that 's at a whole market level   individual bonds however may not be so tightly coupled since the creditworthiness of the issuing entity matters a lot too so it could be that bond rates generally are going up but some specific bonds are going down based on something happening with the issuer just like the stock market might be generally going up even as specific stocks are dropping also keep in mind that many bonds trade as securities on a secondary market much like stocks   so i 've talked about the bond rate   the price of the bonds themselves on the secondary market generally move opposite to the rate   the reason is that for example if you buy a bond at less than face value you 're getting an effective interest rate that 's higher because you get the same sized incremental payments of interest but put less money into the investment   and vice versa

hsbc hang and other hk banks had a series of special savings account offers when i lived in hk a few years ago   some could be linked to the performance of your favorite stock or country 's stock index interest rates were higher back then around 6 one year   what they were effectively doing is taking the interest you would have earned and used it to place a bet on the stock or index in question   technically one way this can be done for instance is with call options and zero coupon bonds or notes   but there was nothing to with once the account was set up so the investor did not need to know how it worked behind the scenes looking at the deposit plus offering in particular this one looks a little more dangerous than what i describe   see now we are in an economy of low almost zero interest rates   so to boost the offered rate the bank is offering you an account where you guarantee the aud hkd rate for the bank in exchange for some extra interest   effectively they sell aud options or want to cover their own aud exposures and you get some of that as extra interest   problem is if the aud declines then you lose money because the savings and interest will be converted to aud at a contractual rate that you are agreeing to now when you take the deposit plus account   this risk of loss is also mentioned in the fine print i would n't recommend this especially if the risks are not clear if you read the fine print you may determine you are better off with a account where you can change your into any currency you like and earn interest in that currency none of these were leveraged forex accounts where you can bet on tiny fluctuations in currencies   tiny being like 1 or 2 moves   generally you should beware anything offering 50:1 or more leverage as a way to possibly lose all of your money quickly since you mentioned being a us citizen you should learn about irs form td f 90 22.1 which must be filed yearly if you have over $ 10,000 in foreign accounts and google a little about the foreign account tax compliance act which shows a shift of the government towards more strict oversight of foreign accounts

i suspect that the times you are referring to are those times when there is relatively low volumes of foreign exchange trading   lower volumes of trading make it possible for large orders to have a disproportionate effect on the market price   this implies that the times to avoid will be the times with the lowest relative volumes   this will occur on the cusp between the new york market winding down and the asia tokyo market up this will be in the hours preceding tokyo 's opening at tokyo time so the time to avoid is about tokyo time or about gmt if i 've worked out the time difference correctly foreign exchange is a 24 hour global market   although each of the three main trading centres london new york asia will operate 24 hours a day they will maintain only a skeleton staff outside of normal working hours   the time difference between london and new york is only 5 hours so there is no period of time when both centres are operating with a skeleton staff   the time difference between london and tokyo is 8 hours so again there is no period of time when both centres are operating with a skeleton staff   the time difference between new york and tokyo is 13 hours   this does include a period where both centres are operating with a skeleton staff as well as london operating on a skeleton staff   thus in the couple of hours immediately preceding tokyo 's opening for the regular trading day there is minimal coverage in each of the three main trading centres   as mentioned above this is the time when large orders can have a disproportionate effect on fx rates and so this is the time to avoid

anyone who wants to can use any method they want ultimately the price of the stock will settle on the valuation that people tend to agree on if you think the priced in numbers are too low buy the stock as that would mean that its price will go up as the future earnings materialize if you think it 's too high short the stock as its price will go down as future earnings fail to materialize the current price represents the price at which just as much pressure pushes the price up as down that means people agree it 's reasonably the expected future value imagine if i needed money now and sold at auction whatever salary i make in 2019 how much will i make in 2019 i might be disabled i might be a high earner who knows but if i auction off those earnings whatever price it sells for represents everyone 's best estimate of that value but each participant in the auction can estimate that value however they want if you want to know what something is worth you see what you can sell it for

if you have a minimum monthly payment amount of $ 190 then you have to make a payment every month if you pay only every 3 months even if you pay 3 times the minimum amount or much more you would not be making the minimum monthly payment for each month one month would get the minimum monthly payment plus a lot more then the following 2 months you would be in default because you did n't pay the minimum amount for that month interest is usually accrued daily so you want to make the payments as early as possible pay back as much as you can afford each month as soon as the money comes in when computing how much you can afford if you have n't already done so it may be a good idea to keep a little bit aside at least the first few months to build up a little security pillow just in case you need it you wo n't be able to get money back from those overpayments if you need any money for an emergency

most countries tax income but not a transfer of already taxed money so you have nothing to worry about you need to be prepared if asked to proof that the money was legally earned and that you paid taxes for the income when you originally got it chances are small that anyone asks though if you are not being investigated for other reasons already

say your bank gives you a loan at a fix interest rate   they can loan money themselves for a floating interest rate   so they try to find someone who will pay or take the difference between the fix and the floating interest rate on your loan     that 's an interest rate swap and there is nothing evil about it per se   derivatives are like knives you can use them for live saving heart surgery or just a kid in a back alley     the inherent danger lies in the fact that it is easier to create than to understand complex derivatives   this can lead to both sides believing they made on the derivative transaction a logically impossible situation   therefore it is always good when derivatives are traded in a transparent well regulated market where current market price is determined   but then the expected profit margins are small so investment bankers will always try to find more exotic derivatives think of a kid using for brain surgery     we need standard derivatives or we have to re think the whole finance world from grounds up without any guarantee we 'll find anything working any better   we do n't need exotic derivatives they 're almost exclusively there because people shoot for bonuses

in a free market supply and demand control the equilibrium point of a commodity price is one of the variables that demand   but the problem is employment is n't a free market you can not freely decide not to accept a job because you need some income to live    the wage of an employee especially at the unskilled tier is much more about availability of workers vs. jobs and better yet those jobs can be into shifts and so you can employ more people for less hours or vice versa    the employer therefore has a lot of control over effective wages as a result and it 's only connected to the free market of the value of service of a burger    so i 'd guess the market value would steadily drop to about the cost of living in the local area maybe a little below even because you can still employ people who are partially subsidised by family and further still you can have people themselves by working additional hours    so i reckon you 'd get equilibrium at about 90 of local cost of living if you work an 80 hour week

the top long term capital gains tax rate will rise to 20 effective 1 jan 2011 unless congress decides to do something about it before then will they who knows there 's been talk about it but well it 's congress they do n't even know what they 're going to do   anyway the rules about when you can sell stock are mostly concerned with when you can realize a capital loss if you sell a stock at a loss and then re buy it for tax purposes within 30 days it 's a wash sale and not eligible for a deduction however i do n't believe this applies to any stocks once you realize a gain once you 've realized the gain and paid your tax for it it 's all yours locked in at whatever rate your replacement stock will be subject to short term capital gains for the next year afterwards and you might need to be careful with identifying the holding period on different lots of your stock but i do n't believe there will be any particular trouble please do not rely entirely on my advice and consult also with your tax preparer or lawyer and the irs documentation special addendum for nov dec 2012 spoiler alert congress did indeed act    they extended the rates but only temporarily so now we 're looking at    tax hikes starting in 2013 instead only the new top will be something    like on account of an extra 3.8 medicare tax on passive earnings brought to you via obamacare    legislation but the year and the rates specifics aside same thing    still applies and the republican house and democratic senate president are still it out have fun + + 3.8 applies to the lesser of a net investment income b income over $ 200,000 $ 250k if married 20 tax rate applies to people in the 15 income tax bracket for ordinary income or higher additional tax discounts for property held over 5 years may be available consult tax law and your favorite tax professional and prepare to be confused

the calculations you suggest have some issues but i think they are not necessary to answer the question it sounds like you are buying the house either way so the question really is simply whether to pay toward your house first or your loan first   in that case the answer is simple pay whichever has the highest interest rate first   make the minimum payment on the other until the first is paid off   remember this and make it your mantra for the rest of your life   if you have any debts such as credit cards that charge a rate higher than the two options you have presented do them first now be careful as you compute the interest rates   most likely you can deduct interest on your mortgage so its effective interest rate is lower it is instead of r where t is your marginal tax rate for a while the cost of mortgage insurance will make your effective mortgage rate artificially high but it sounds like you intend to get to that 20 hurdle pretty fast so my guess is that this is not a big factor congratulations on your bonus and good luck with your new home

first you need to understand that not   every investor 's goals are the same some investors are investing for income they want to invest in a profitable company and use the profit from the company as income if that investor invests only in stocks that do not pay a dividend the only way he can realize income is to sell his investment but he can invest in companies that pay a regular dividend and use that income while keeping his investment intact   imagine this let 's say i own a profitable company and i offer to sell you part ownership in that company however i tell you this upfront no matter how much profit our company makes you will never get a penny from me you will be getting a stock certificate a piece of paper and that 's it you can watch the company grow and you can tell yourself you own it but the only way you will personally benefit from your investment would be to sell your piece to someone else who would also never see a penny in profit does that sound like a good investment the fact of the matter is stocks in companies that do not distribute dividends do have value but this value is largely based on the potential of profits dividends at some point in the future if a company never ever to pay dividends why would anyone invest   an investment would be more of a donation like kickstarter at that point   a company that pays dividends is possibly past their growth stage that does n't necessarily mean that they have stopped growing altogether but remember that an expansion project for any company does not automatically yield a good result if a company does not have a good opportunity currently for a growth project i as an investor would rather get a dividend than have the company blow all the profit on a ill gamble

this election only applies to payments that you make within 120 days of your having received loan money these would n't be required payments which is why they are called early payments for example let 's say that you 've just received $ 10,000 from your lender for a new loan one month later you pay $ 500 back this election decides how that $ 500 will be applied   the first choice apply as refund means that you are essentially returning some of the money that you initially borrowed it 's like you never borrowed it instead of a $ 10,000 loan it is now a $ 9,500 loan the accrued interest will be recalculated for the new loan amount   the second choice apply as payment means that your payment will first be applied to any interest that has accrued then applied to the principal while you are in school you do n't need to make payments on student loans however interest is accruing from the day you get the money this interest is simple interest which means that the interest is only based on the loan principal the interest is not compounding and you are not paying interest on interest after you leave school and your grace period expires you enter repayment and you have to start making payments at this point all the interest that has accrued from the time you first received the money until now is capitalized this means that the interest is added to your loan principal and interest will now be calculated on this new larger amount to avoid this you can pay the interest as you go before it is capitalized which will save you from having to pay even more interest later on   as to which method is better just as they told you right on the form the apply as refund method will save you the most money in the long run   however as i said at the beginning this election only applies if you make a payment within 120 days from receiving loan funds since you are already out of school and in repayment i do n't think it matters at all what you select here   for any students reading this and thinking about loans i want to issue a warning student loans can ruin people later in life if you truly feel that taking out a loan is the only way you 'll be able to get the education you need minimize these as much as possible borrow as little as possible pay as much as you can as early as you can and plan on knocking these out asap great lakes has a few pages that discuss these topics

paying $ 12,000 in lump annually will mean a difference of about $ 250 in interest vs. paying $ 1,000 monthly if front load the big payment that saves over paying monthly over the year if you planned to save that money each month and pay it at the end then it would cost you more in mortgage interest so that 's how much money you would have to make with that saved money to offset the cost over the life of the loan the choice between the two equates to less than $ 5,000 if you pay monthly it 's easy to calculate that an extra $ 1,000/month would reduce the loan to 17 years 3 months that would give you a savings of at the cost of paying $ extra during those 17 years many people would suggest that you invest the money instead because the annual growth rates of the stock market are well in excess of your mortgage what you decide is up to you and how conservative your investing strategy is

it 's rarely advisable to pay interest for something you can afford with cash just because you have no credit or loan history does n't mean you are n't credit worthy when applying for loans or credit the lending institutions look at your credit report not just your credit score there are lots of things that show up on the reports they receive including but not limited to right now so many people are focused on their credit score they 're taking on unnecessary debt and potentially losing money in the long run yes having a higher credit score will ultimately be beneficial but your score will start growing naturally as you live your life unless of course you can and do pay for everything with cash the concept of monitoring your score and striving to get it as high as possible is being shoved down our throats by advertisers at the moment do n't fall for it rather than taking out a loan which will cost you money in interest and actually show up as a closed account once it 's paid off you might be better served by applying for a credit card and using it sparingly just to start getting that credit history together add usual do n't spend more than you can pay back mantra here get a card with no annual fee and maybe some cash back options and use it as the auto payment for a utility if possible you build credit history increase your score and it does n't cost you any more than you 'd be paying anyways    with regards to the investment question with little to no credit history you 're not going to be approved for a loan with a low enough interest rate anyways think double digits with a co signer you 'll get a better rate but then you need a co signer i do n't know the exact math but in today 's market i 'd say you 'd need a loan interest rate of 2 or lower for investing to be worth thinking about   i believe this answer helps clarify the loan to invest math

a market maker is someone that is contractually bound by the exchange to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume e.g. 5000 shares a single market maker usually covers many stocks and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers the nyse has specialists that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock and usually a single issue on the nyse is covered by only one market maker   market makers are often middlemen between brokers ignoring stuff like dark pools and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange   historically the market makers gave up buy sell discretion in exchange for being the go to guys for anyone wanting to trade in that stock when you told your broker to buy a stock for you he did n't hook you up with another retail investor he went to the market maker market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security they were like other floor traders they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist 's issues there was no public order book just ticker tape and a quote it was up to the market maker to maintain that order book   since they are effectively forbidden from being one sided traders in a security their profit comes from the bid ask spread being the counter party to almost every trade they 'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying except when the price moved quickly the downside to this arrangement the spread goes to the market maker is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker with the switch to ecns the role of the market maker has changed for example forex trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers on ecns the invisible anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker still performing his traditional role yet brokers can interact directly with each other now rather than relying on the market maker 's book with modern online investing and public order books retail investors might even be trading directly with each other market makers are still out there in part they perform a service sold by an exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange that service has changed to helping volatility during normal high volatility periods such as at open and close

generally it is a taxable transaction basic principle of taxation everywhere is that the mean of payment does n't matter if the income is taxable it is taxable regardless of the unit of currency you used it can be a strawberry a bitcoin a gold nugget or a dollar it does n't change a thing about how it is taxed if you look at the united states tax code definition of taxable income for example you will find no mention whatsoever of any currency similarly with other tax laws i 'm familiar with i 'm sure there 's no such limitation in australia

a federal or state regulator has ordered that the rdfi can not participate in the ach network or the rdfi 's participation has been limited in some capacity   you need to contact the rdfi for more details ask for their ach operations group   the rdfi is the institution receiving the ach transaction   it could be either the debit side or credit side   it is not the institution originating the ach transaction which is the odfi the entire rdfi institution might be restricted for an extremely poor audit or rampant suspect money laundering or terrorist funding specific accounts at the rdfi might be limited for a variety of reasons including freezing the account for suspicious activity money laundering or terrorist funding court order for impending legal proceedings irs levies for nonpayment of taxes or perhaps child support delinquency   i am making an educated guess on the reasons

now asking if college is worth it   that 's not the question that should be asked   higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it 's of high quality   the question that should be asked is why is the cost of college as high as it is   when i went to college to get my bachelors a semester at my state university cost $ bucks us this was in the early to mid 90s   twenty years later that same education cost $ 6,500 per semester   the main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice much less so in the 90s   any time you need to borrow to pay for something you 're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill   today kids borrow for college because they do n't have much choice if their parents did n't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school   and if you have this level of debt right out of college your hands will be tied for decades it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending   the only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash and to do that you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future   if schools know you ca n't or wo n't borrow to pay for an education they adjust

generally speaking the bank accounts and credit card accounts remain open   banks and the credit card companies do n't monitor public records on a daily basis   instead whoever is handling your estate will need to obtain copies of your death certificate and they will then search your paper records to identify all accounts reason to get your act together there are books on the subject   the executor will work with the banks and card companies to make sure all your charges and payments clear common to have them open for months or even a year and to make close or transfer   they will make sure to notify the credit agencies to flag your accounts so no new accounts can be created   many copies of the death are needed

i was going to comment on the commission free etf answer which i agree with but i do n't have enough reputation td ameritrade has a list of commission free etfs and has no minimum deposit required to open an account another idea is to keep gifts in cash until a certain threshold is reached for instance $ 100 for birthday $ 100 for christmas $ 100 for next birthday $ 100 for next christmas now execute the trade sharebuilder has $ 4 scheduled trades so you 'd be at about 1 overhead for that if other people give money you 'll reach the threshold faster of course for what it 's worth i do something similar for my 2 nieces i combined their account and prepay christmas plus birthday so i do 1 trade a year i have my account at sharebuilder because my idea the commission free etfs that are now pretty popular i should really transfer the account hm

if only someone would make a decent android with a blackberry style keyboard rim could die a more honorable and fast death   i 'm still using an old bb and the only reason i 'm holding off on buying the blackberry bold the one with the half height touchscreen is because i 'm afraid the company is about to go out of business   the blackberry bold is what they should have released years ago instead of their parade of that was the storm the torch the playbook and now a new 10 phone with no fucking keyboard   are they insane

i would have asked for the intended recipient 's account number and pursue sending the money there if it 's the same as yours except for one digit that would be a good sign but even here the crook could send money to dozens of different accounts all off by one digit just to make it look authentic i 'm going with scam just to be safe as for the checksum it 's used on paper checks next to the last digit but not necessarily the actual account credit card accounts use an algorithm but online tools create as many legitimate character strings as you want i used to work at a credit union and when the time was just right i opened account number actual account number except for the second digit all their account numbers were sequential so the oldest account number was sadly many important systems are set up to meet the simple needs of the masses and are easy to beat if you really want to check out if you dare hackers to hack you they 'll hack you good
