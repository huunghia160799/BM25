its is considered a hobby income and you should be reporting it on the 1040 as taxable income the expenses what you pay are hobby expenses and you report them on schedule a if you itemize you can only deduct the hobby expenses to the extent of your hobby income and they 're subject to the 2 agi threshold

technically this is considered income for you and is actually not considered a donation for your donors but is instead a gift not tax deductible for your donors so you are technically required to report it and there is a pretty significant audit trail that can be followed to prove you made that money i do n't know if paypal is required to file 1099s for payments received but if you 've ever received such a document so has the irs and they 'll match it to the income you claimed and see a discrepancy triggering an audit depending on the amount that it affects your taxes it can be significant if you have a   $ 50k yr day job you 'd owe the government 25 cents on every dollar donated they can let it slide they may simply dock your next return or they may come after you for interest and penalties or even charge you with criminal tax fraud if they could prove you maliciously attempted to conceal this revenue now if you already itemize using a schedule a then you can erase this income by deducting the costs of the server not to exceed the amount of the donations the best you can do is offset it you can not use this deduction to reduce taxable income from other sources also you must itemize you ca n't take your standard deduction and with a maximum possible deduction of the actual costs of running the server $ 1500 if you receive enough donations to fully pay for it compared to one person 's standard deduction $ 5800 you 'll want to take the standard deduction if you do n't have other significant deductions medical expenses mortgage interest property taxes etc if you were charging users a monthly fee for use of the server then you 've basically created a de facto sole proprietorship and you would still have to count the fees as income but could then deduct the full cost of running the server you 'd fill out a schedule c listing the revenue and expenses and back them up with statements from your isp hosting company and from paypal now this would apply if you were running the server with the primary goal of making a regular profit schedule c can not be used for income from a hobby undertaken primarily for enjoyment and where a few bucks in revenue is gravy whether you think you can get away with that in your current situation is your prerogative i do n't think you would given that the donations are solicited and optional and thus there is no expectation of ever turning a profit on this game server

first to clear a few things up    it is definitely not a gift the people are sending you money only because you are providing them with a service    and for tax purposes it is not a donation it has nothing to do with the fact that you are soliciting the donation as charitable organizations solicit donations all the time for tax purposes it is not a donation because you do not have 501(c)(3 non profit status    it is income the question is then is it business income or hobby related income    firstly you have n't mentioned but it 's important to consider how much money are you receiving from this monthly or how much money do you expect to receive from this annually    if it 's a minimal amount say $ 50 a month or less then you probably just want to treat it as a hobby mostly because with this level of income it 's not likely to be profitable in that case report the income and pay the tax the tax you will owe will be minimal and will probably be less than the costs involved with setting up and running it as a business anyway as a hobby you wo n't be able to deduct your expenses server costs etc unless you itemize your taxes on schedule a.    on the other hand if your income from this will be significantly more than $ now or in the near future then you should consider running it as a business    get it clear in your mind that it 's a business and that you intend it to be profitable perhaps it wo n't be profitable now or even for a while what 's important at this point is that you intend it to be profitable    the irs will consider if it looks like a business and it acts like a business then it 's probably a business so make it so    come up with a name for your business register the business with your state and/or county as necessary in your location get a bank account for your business get a separate business paypal account keep personal and business expenses and income separate    as a business when you file your taxes you will be able to file a schedule c form even if you do not itemize your taxes on schedule a. on schedule c you list and total your business income and your business expenses then you subtract the expenses from the income to calculate your profit or loss    if your business income is more than your business expenses you pay tax on the difference the profit   if your business expenses are more than your business income then you have a business loss you would not have to pay any income tax on the business income and you may be able to be carry the loss over to the next and following years you may want to have a service do your taxes for you but at this level it is certainly something you could do yourself with some minimal consultations with an accountant

all you have to do is ask warren buffet that question and you 'll have your answer grin   he is the very definition of someone who relies on the fundamentals as a major part of his investment decisions investors who rely on analysis of fundamentals tend to be more long term strategic planners than most other investors who seem more focused on momentum based thinking there are some industries which have historically low p e ratios such as utilities but i do n't think that implies poor growth prospects   how often does a utility go out of business    i think oftentimes if you really look into the numbers there are companies reporting higher earnings and earnings growth but is that top line growth or is it the result of cost cutting and other measures which artificially imply a healthy and growing company   a healthy company is one which shows year over year organic growth in revenues and earnings from sales not one which has to continually make new acquisitions or use accounting tricks to dress up the bottom line is it possible to do well by investing in companies with solid fundamentals   absolutely   you may not realize the same rate of short term returns as others who use momentum based trading strategies but over the long haul i 'm willing to bet you 'll see a better overall average return than they do

why must terms must be mutually exclusive   this false dichotomy is what seems to cause the most debate   it is the single event outcome that defines gambling gambling will involve an contract that is the outcome is specifically tied to a single event that determines profit loss this could be the outcome of a race or the roll of a dice but should involve chance   this is why gambling is often in the context of a game but i would make the argument that some investment tools fall into this category the price of a stock at a certain date for example this may also be called betting which opens up a whole other discussion investing has no such implication and as such it is the broader term   investing is to put something money to work to return a profit some forms of gambling could fall under this umbrella some would say that is a bad investment and even if they are right it may still be the desire and intent of the investor to make a profit   not all gambling falls under investing you can gamble for pleasure   the profit loss of most investments are not contractually tied to a specific event or outcome e.g. the price of a stock over 10 years is the result of many events affecting its market value such an investment would not be considered gambling

while the us hosts most of the world 's innovative startups its own financial and banking systems are very slow to change   the infrastructure exists however the ach transfers are not wide spread between individuals banks much prefer the option of bill pay i.e. as you said mailing a check something in other countries people would n't even think of than letting you do it yourself   why because they can there 's no real competition over consumers and the consumers themselves are not educated or sophisticated thus the banks are comfortable with the lack of innovation since as long as they are all lacking innovation consumers wo n't demand it because they wo n't even know things are possible and it is definitely cheaper for the banks not to innovate and keep your money for a week while the bill pay check is en route than try and develop new things in other countries the regulator would step up and force banks to develop new infrastructure and widen the options but in the us regulation is considered a bad thing and people are easily swayed being uneducated and uninformed by the corporations to support politicians who act against their people 's best interest in protecting the corporations and reducing and limiting the regulators even further

# 478966
there are two different possible taxes based on various scenarios proposed by the op or the lawyer who drew up the op 's father 's will or the op 's mother    first there is the estate tax which is paid by the estate of the deceased and the heirs get what is left most estates in the us pay no estate tax whatsoever because most estates are smaller than $ 5.4 m lifetime gift and estate tax exemption but for the record even though iras pass from owner to beneficiary independent of whatever the will might say about the disposition of the iras the value of the deceased 's iras is part of the estate and if the estate is large enough that estate tax is due and there is not enough money in the rest of the estate to pay the estate tax e.g. most of the estate value is ira money and there are no other investments just a bank account with a small balance then the executor of the will can petition the probate court to claw back some of the ira money from the ira beneficiaries to pay the estate tax due second there is income tax that the estate must pay on income received from the estate 's assets e.g. mutual fund dividends paid between the date of death and the distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries or income from cashing in iras that have the estate as the beneficiary now most of op 's father 's estate is in iras which have the op 's mother as the primary beneficiary and there are no named secondary beneficiaries thus by default the estate is the ira beneficiary should the op 's mother the iras as the lawyer has suggested as @joetaxpayer says in a comment if the op 's mother the ira then the estate must distribute all the ira assets to the three beneficiaries by december 31 of the year in which the fifth anniversary of the death occurs if the estate decides to do this by itself then the distribution from the ira to the estate is taxable income to the estate best avoided if possible because of the high tax rates on trusts what is commonly done is that before december 31 of the year following the year in which the death occurred the estate as the beneficiary informs the ira custodian that the estate 's beneficiaries are the surviving spouse 50 and the two children 25 each and requests the ira custodian to divide the ira assets accordingly and let each beneficiary be responsible for meeting the requirements of the 5-year rule for his her share any assets not distributed in timely fashion are subject to a 50 excise tax as penalty each year until such time as these monies are actually withdrawn explicitly from the ira that is the excise tax is not deducted from the remaining ira assets the beneficiary has to pay the excise tax out of pocket as far as the irs is concerned there are no yearly distribution requirements to be met but the ira custodial agreement might have its own rules and so publication 590b recommends discussing the distribution requirements for the 5-year rule with the ira custodian the money distributed from the ira is taxable income to the recipients in particular the children can not roll the money over into another ira so as to avoid immediate taxation the spouse might be able to roll over the money into another ira but i am not sure about this publication 590b is very confusing on this point    all this is assuming that the deceased passed away before well before his birthday so that there are no issues with rmds the interactions of all the rules in this case is an even bigger can of worms that i will leave to someone else to on the other hand if the op 's mother does not the iras then she as the surviving spouse has the option of treating the inherited iras as her own iras and she could then name her two children as the beneficiaries of the inherited iras when she passes away   of course by the same token she could opt to make someone else the beneficiary e.g her children from a previous marriage or change her mind at any later time and make someone else the beneficiary e.g. if she or becomes very fond of the person taking care of her in a nursing home and decides to leave all her assets to this person instead of her children etc   but even if such are unlikely and the children are perfectly happy to wait to inherit till mom passes away as joetaxpayer points out by not the iras the op 's mother can delay taking distributions from the iras till age 70.5 etc which is also a good option to have the worst scenario is for the op 's mother to not the iras cash them in right away huge income tax whack on her or at least 50 of them and gift the op and his sibling half of what she withdrew or possibly after taking into account what she had to pay in income tax on the distribution gift tax need not be paid by the op 's mother if she files form 709 and reduces her lifetime combined gift and estate tax exemption and the op and his sibling do n't owe any tax income or otherwise on the gift amount   but all that money has changed from tax deferred assets to ordinary assets and any additional earnings on these assets in the future will be taxable income so unless the op and his sibling need the cash right away pay off credit card debt make a downpayment on a house etc this is not a good idea at all

why do companies exist well the corporate charter describes why the company exists usually the purpose is to enrich the shareholders the owners of a company want to make money in other words there are a number of ways that a shareholder can make money off a stock as such maintaining the stock price and dividend payouts are generally the number one concern for any company in the long term most of the company 's business is going to be directed towards making the company more valuable for a future buyout or more valuable in terms of what it can pay its shareholders directly note that the company does n't always need to be worried about the specifics of the day to day moves of the stock if it keeps the finances in line solid profits margins earnings growth and the like and can tell people that it 's generally a valuable business it can usually shrug off any medium term as market some companies are more explicitly long term about things than others e.g. berkshire hathaway basically tells people that it does n't care all that much about what happens in the short term   of course companies are and they 're run by people to make the people running the company worry about the stock price you give them stock or stock options or something like that a major executive at a big company is likely to have a significant amount of stock if the company does well he does well if it does poorly he does poorly despite a few limitations this is really a powerful incentive if a company is losing a lot of money or if its profits are falling so it 's just losing a lot of its value as a business the owners stockholders tend to get upset and may vote in new management or launch some sort of shareholder lawsuit and as previously noted to raise funds a company can also issue new shares to the market as a secondary offering as well and they can issue fewer shares if the price is high meaning that whatever the company is worth afterward the existing owners own proportionally more of it

you might want to read about about the coase theorem   in law and economics the coase theorem attributed to ronald coase describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities the theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights in practice obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent bargaining this is similar to what you are asking each country has an endowment of gold and they must create a set amount of money to represent their endowment of gold this will establish an exchange rate if i have 5 tons of gold and you have 5 tons and i print 10 dollars and you print 20 then one of my dollars is worth two of your dollars   thus the amount of money is not   it 's the exchange rate between the countries if all the nations know each other 's gold endowment then we will have a perfect exchange rate if we do n't then currency printing will vary but arbitrage should drive it to an accurate price   gold and diamonds are both valuable in part due to scarcity but gold has been used as a measure of value because it 's been historically used as a medium of exchange people just realized that swapping paper was safer and cheaper than physically transporting gold but the idea of gold as a measure of value is present because that 's how it 's always been nobody creates these procedures but organizations like the imf ecb fed reserve etc implement monetary policy to regulate the money supply and arbitrage drives exchange rates to fair values

the most important lesson is never lend money to friends unless you are willing to forget the lent amount if the need arises to save your friendship money and relations friendship is a dangerous cocktail your friend may assume as you are his friend he may get lenient treatment while treating the money and if you about the money your friendship may suffer so be careful while lending money to friends if you make up a contract your friend may ask why if he is n't reasonable as you are his friend from personal experience i forget about the lent money but it down somewhere and when i am repaid i strike it off i never discuss about the money or bring it up people do n't like to be reminded by a friend that they owe them money   but refusing also is n't a viable option either you probably have to take a middle path

yes it 's possible however it 's not likely at least not for most people earning a million is not that difficult but when you talk about billions that 's an entirely different story i think the key point that you 're missing is leverage it 's common knowledge that warren buffett likes to have a huge cash at his disposal and does not soak himself in debt however in his early years buffett did not get to where he 's at by investing only his own money he ran what was basically a hedge fund and leveraged other peoples money in the market this magnified his returns quite substantially if you look at buffett 's investments you 'll notice that he had a handful of huge wins in his portfolio and many more just mediocre success stories not everything he invested in turned to gold but his portfolio was by the large wins that continued to compound over many years because he held them for so long also consider the fact that buffett 's wealth is largely measured in berkshire stock this stock is a reflection of anticipated future earnings by the company there 's no way that alone could turn    $ 10k in 1950 into $ 50b today could    it why not take the two founders of google for example they became billionaires in short order when google had it 's ipo and basically started in a garage with very little cash of course they did n't do this by buying and selling shares there are many paths to earnings enormous sums of money like the people you 're talking about but one characteristic that the richest people in society seem to have in common is that they all own their own companies

assuming you 've got no significant prepayment penalty i would think about getting a longer mortgage but making payments like it was a shorter mortgage this will get the mortgage paid off in a shorter time period but if you run into financial difficulties and/or find a better use for your money you can drop back to paying the minimum necessary to retire the loan in 30 years without needing to refinance if you need to reduce your payments because you 're between jobs you do n't have a very good negotiating position   for the most part there 's nothing that says you can only make one payment per month or that it must be in the amount printed on the statement if you want to you can make payments weekly or biweekly or every 4 weeks which typically means that you 'll pay more every year if your mortgage payments are $ 1000/month that 's $ 12,000 per year if you tell yourself that 1000/month = $ 250 weekly and make yourself send a payment every week or 500 every 2 weeks you 'll end up paying 250 52 = $ 13,000 per year without particularly feeling the difference especially if you get paid on a weekly biweekly schedule instead of monthly or semi monthly also by paying more often you 're borrowing a tiny bit less money over the course of the year because the money did n't sit in your account waiting until the 1st of the month to make a payment so you save a little in interest there too   think of 30 years or 10 years as the basis for a minimum payment schedule not necessarily the length of time that you or the lender really intend to keep the loan

the key to this is budgeting without a budget you do n't know what you are spending your money on   let 's say you would like to go to a movie with a friend   can you afford it   without a budget it is difficult to answer this question   yes you have enough money in your wallet but if you do n't go to the movies you could be saving that money for a house   but you might say to yourself surely one movie with my friend wo n't prevent me from saving my $ 10k for my house   and you might be right but when you add up all the movies coffees and other discretionary spending up it very well could    at this point you might be discouraged   do i seriously need to give up every single to make this work   i do n't have that kind of willpower   luckily here is where budgeting comes to the rescue budgeting is simply a plan for your money   you have some monthly expenses that are more or less fixed your rent your utility bills etc   you have other expenses that are not exactly fixed but are still necessary groceries fuel for your car etc   you also have longer range expenses such as insurance premiums that you only pay once or twice a year but need to be accounted for   list all of these expenses and figure out how much that comes to each month   what you have left over is available to you for other things next you need to figure out how fast you want to save for this house and balance that with the other things you might want to spend money on such as entertainment   if you start from $ 0 and want to save $ 10k you could do it by saving $ 100 a month in a little over 8 years you 'll have your $ 10k   if you can increase this to $ 300 a month you 'll be there in less than 3 years now that you have a plan and everything is accounted for very little willpower is needed   you do n't need to feel guilty every time you buy coffee if the money is there in your coffee snacks budget go for it   if you 've got extra money for the month in your entertainment budget take a date to the movies   your budget allows you to spend on those things because you have a plan in place and are not in danger of spending your rent money or your home savings this can all be done on paper in excel or even by placing cash in different envelopes   however it is easier to use budgeting software such as ynab mvelopes or everydollar

you can illustrate why expense ratio fees are in the numerator with an extreme example   let 's say you have $ 100 in a mutual fund their expense ratio is 50 your nominal return is 900 and inflation is 900   thus without the expense your investment would give you $ 100 in present value because your return and inflation are identical and $ 1000 in future value   so with the expense ratio of 50 and no change in present value you can reason that you would expect the expense ratio will eat half the present value   if you apply your equation and include expenses in the numerator you end up with   100 + + 9 = $ 50 present value as you would expect   if you apply the manager 's assumption that fees are applied external to inflation then you end up with   100 1 + + 9 100 1 + 9 .50 = $ present value   with this example you can see applying the fees externally acts as though they are charging you the fees on future returns today   edit   it 's probably not worth fighting with someone senior to you over as inflation rates are noisy estimates to begin with and the difference between these is typically not material to the decision being made but pissing off someone senior by showing them their math is off will probably have a material impact on you

for your base question yes   barring some major collapse of civilization event but in that case you 're screwed anyway   on the individual points 1 depends on whether you choose to invest in index type funds where profit is mainly expected from price appreciation or more value based investing   but either or a mix of the two my own choice should show returns above inflation over the long term 2 yes in the us anyway   you can invest a few hundred dollars at a time and with good companies like vanguard t. rowe price there are no transaction fees either for investing or for redeeming    3 long term it 's crash proof if you have the self discipline not to panic sell at market lows   in my case my total fund valuation dropped around 40 in 08   i did n't sell anything and in fact tried to cut spending and invest more and now i have nearly double what i had before the crash bottom line is that it has worked for me   after ~30 years of investing this way without being fanatic about it i have enough that i could live moderately without working for the rest of my life   not and this is where i part company with mmm and most of the fire community that i 'd ever want to actually retire   but my modest financial independence gives me the freedom to work at things i like rather than because i 'm worrying about paying bills

the first thing i assess when looking at new credit cards is whether it has no annual fee the second thing i look at is how long the interest free period is i always pay my credit card off in full just before the due date any rewards program is a bonus my main credit card is with cba i have a credit limit of $ 20 k and pay no annual fee i get a bonus point for every $ i spend on it for which i exchange for store gift cards to help with my everyday spending approximately 3500 point would get me a $ 25 gift card but my main reward with the card is the interest i save by keeping my own money in a home loan offset account whilst i spend with the bank 's money then i pay the full amount off by the due date so i do not pay any interest on the credit card i only use my credit cards for purchases i would usually make anyway and to pay bills so my spending would be the same with or without a credit card i can usually save over $ 500 each year off my home loan interest and get about $ 350 worth of gift cards each year if i did n't have any home loans then i would keep my money in a high interest account so i would be increasing my interest payments each year sure you can probably get credit cards with more generous rewards programs but how much are you paying each year in annual fees and if you do n't have an interest free period and you do n't pay off all the amount due each month how much are you paying in interest on the card this is what you need to way up when looking at rewards programs on offer nothing is for free well almost nothing

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

if you 're talking about an etf trading on arca it 's probably because of the opening auction the match price is the price that maximizes the volume that can be executed within the auction collars the core open auction will use the match price closest to the closing price of the previous trading day based on normal market hours if more than one indicative match price is valid the core opening auction does n't really take the opening session activity into account as you can see the market runs an auction and whatever price clears the most volume within certain limits is the opening print

a common response to poor labour conditions is if you do n't like your job leave and get a better one    however in idaho the state is trying to deregulate aspects of the labour market it 's making it easier for companies to enforce non compete agreements meaning you literally can not leave for a competitor if you do n't like your employer    that 's a natural consequence of labour markets it lets the companies with enormous budgets push around workers who are at the same time having their ability to organise into unions and bargain collectively undermined by companies who use said economic power to lobby against regulations that protect workers    so free market away but do n't convince yourself that a lack of regulation will somehow magically lead to a utopian allocation of resources where everyone gets what they need    in a totally unregulated market the wealth only trickles one way and it 's not down

i think it 's great that you want to contribute course instructor you may want to take a look at becoming an instructor for a course like dave ramsey 's financial peace university these are commonly offered through churches and other community venues for a fee this may be a good fit if you want to focus on basic financial literacy setting up and sticking to a budget and getting their financial house in order it may not be a good fit if you do n't want to teach an existing curriculum or if you find the tenets of the course too unpalatable a significant number of the people in dave 's audience are close to or in the middle of a financial meltdown and so his advice includes controversial ideas such as avoiding credit altogether often because that 's how they got into their current mess counselor if you want to run your own show i know of several people who have built their own practice that is run along the lines of a counselor charging hourly rates and they work with couples who are having money problems building a reputation and a network of referring counselors and professionals is key here and definitely seems like it would require a full time commitment i would avoid credit counseling and the like most of these organizations are focused on restructuring credit card debt not spending time on behavioral change you do n't need a series 7 63 65 etc or even a cfa i 've previously acquired a number of these and can confirm that they are investment credentials that are intended to help you get a job and/or get more business as a broker or conventional financial planner i.e. salesperson of securities the process is necessary to protect consumers from advice that serves the investment sales force but is bad for the consumer and because you must be licensed to provide investment advice there is a class of fee only financial planners but they primarily deal with complex issues that allow them to make money and often give away basic personal finance advice for free in the form of articles podcasts etc   charity for part time or free work in my area there are also several charity organizations that help people do their taxes and provide basic budgeting and personal finance instruction but this is very localized and may vary quite a bit depending on where you live however if there are none near you you can always start one journalism if you have an interest in writing there are also people who work as journalists and write columns books or newsletters and it is much easier now to publish and build a network online either on your own through a blog or contributing to a website speaker at community events there are also many opportunities to speak to a specific community such as a church or social organization for example where i live there are local organizations for spanish speaking polish speaking elderly young professional young mother and retiree groups for example all of who might be interested in your advice on issues that specifically address their needs good luck

first i 'm not a cpa or international tax accountant my entire understanding of the french tax system is entirely from what i 've read in places like the wsj wapo etc    however my understanding is that french tax law works something like this let 's say france has a tax rate of 35 first it must be assessed where the controlling entity is in this case if the majority of production and labor or if the corporation is primarily based in france it would proceed as follows taxes are initially paid based on transfer pricing to the original local entity this avoids double taxation so in the example above you would pay 10 to india on the $ in profits $ 300,000 you would then reduce the 35 french tax rate by the 10 already paid this means you would pay an additional 25 to france $ 750,000 the premise is that you have an effective minimum tax threshold for being in france in the case above companies like ge would have to pay the difference this does n't get into tax breaks shelters on previously recorded losses etc    again i am not sure on this is my basic understanding and am by no means a tax accountant lawyer etc from what i understand however this has n't necessarily been a good thing for france either california is likely a similar case study with the return requirement the fact is the world is very global nowadays its easier and cheaper for the companies to just leave instead of being forced to pay higher taxes   imo germany hit it right on the head low corporate tax rates with high personal tax rates this maintains a very business friendly environment business move there because of the skilled labor and low corporate taxes but they effectively pass the burden on to individuals who also benefit from the pro business environment you 'd be hard pressed to find an economist that does n't think germany 's economy has been very strong over the past decade very good soros speech that was recently posted about his analysis of the euro and germany 's unfair benefits but that 's a whole different gear    what i find the issue to be is the whole concept is complex enough that 's difficult to explain to the average person with a 2 second attention span that 's why i like writing posts like this to try to help people understand how finance and businesses operate behind the scenes

it is definitely legal however none of such expenses will be allowed as a tax deduction for the corporation basically you 'll end up paying more to maintain the entity and pay taxes on its income the rent you 're paying to yourself as a corporation at corporate rates for no apparent benefit being the director executive in the corporation will make you liable for whatever the corporation is liable so liability is n't going away the reason corporation is considered limited liability for owners is because shareholders are shielded from the corporate liability not directors or executives which are explicitly not shielded

it says expense ratio of 0.14 what does it mean essentially it means that they will take 0.14 of your money regardless of the performance this measures how much money the fund spends out of its assets on the regular management expenses how much taxes will i be subject to this depends on your personal situation not much to do with the fund though investment rebalancing policies may affect the taxable distributions if you hold it in your ira there will be no taxes at all however some funds do have measures of non taxable distributions vs dividends vs. capital gains not all the funds do that and these are very rough estimates anyway what is considered to be a reasonable expense ratio that depends greatly on the investment policy for passive index funds 0.05 0.5 is a reasonable range while for actively managed funds it can go up as much as 2 and higher you need to compare to other funds with similar investment policies to see where your fund stands

it 's not just about price uber and other companies provide several other things better than cabs   however they do it whether monitoring gps or sensor data from the phone incentivize drivers to accelerate and brake gently as well as go the speed limit cab drivers in my experience drive like assholes by using the star rating system incentivize drivers and riders to act like civilized people cab drivers in my experience do n't give a shit by charging for time as well as mileage incentivize drivers to take their time and get people where they want to be cab drivers in my experience want people out of the car as quickly as possible so they can get to their next fare made it an effective part time job as well as a full time job a driver can pick their own schedule and drive when they 're available one can make a living or just make some extra money   and my description of their business model is correct again it 's not just pricing the medallion system ensures that a driver starts out in debt it is a barrier to entry it also ties a driver 's retirement to a supply demand market of a commodity it 's an artificial barrier that blocks supply demand of people willing to fill the role in a market all of this allows cab companies to charge whatever they bloody well please and pay their drivers shit wages which is probably the reason they drive and act like assholes

the trade off seems to be quite simple how much are you going to get if you sell it against how much are you going to get if you rent it out several people already hinted that the rental revenue may be optimistic i do n't have anything to add to this but keep in mind that if someone pays 45k for your apartment the net gains for you will likely be lower as well another consideration would be that the value of your apartment can change if you expect it to rise steadily you may want to think twice before selling now assuming you have calculated your numbers properly and a near 0 opportunity cost 45,000 right now per year the given numbers imply a return on investment of 14 years or 7.1 personal conclusion i would be surprised if you can actually get a expected net profit for an apartment that rents out at 6k per year but if you are confident the reward seems to be quite nice

you should have separate files for each of the two businesses   the business that transfers money out should write check in its qb file   the business that receives money should make deposit in its qb file in qb you write check even when you make the payment by some other means like ach   neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented    on each side you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from gone to some other account to know what 's correct there we 'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established   i think that 's probably beyond the scope of what 's on topic feasible here money into your business from your personal account is probably owner 's equity unless you have something else going on   for example on the s corp you should be paying yourself a salary   if you overpay by accident then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake   that 's not equity it 's probably a negative expense in some other account that tracks the salary payments

bonds are priced very high because their price is compared to their yields with the current interest rates which are very low the bond yields will be low however bond issuers still need the money so there still will be high par value and investors will not sell bonds at a loss unless there 's a better investment = bonds with better yields once the rates start going up you 'll see bonds with current rates dropping in value significantly once alternatives appear people holding them will start dumping them to move the money somewhere more profitable similarly the stocks since there 's no other investment alternatives yields on the bonds are low interests are low people invest more in the stocks once the rates go up the investors will start rebalancing portfolios and cashing out

your question has already been answered you divide the amount of shares you own 100 by the total amount of shares however i feel it is somewhat misleading to talk about owning a percentage of the company by owning shares strictly speaking shares do not entitle you to a part of the company but instead give you a proportional amount of votes at shareholder meetings assuming no funky share classes what this means is that someone who owns 30 of a company 's shares ca n't just grab 30 of the company 's assets factories offices and whatever and say that they are entitled to own this what they actually own is 30 of the voting rights in this company this means that they control 30 of all available votes when the company calls a vote on corporate actions choosing a new director etc which is how shareholders exert their influence on a company

this is obviously a spam mail your mortgage is a public record and mortgage brokers and insurance agents were are and will be soliciting your business as long as they feel they have a chance of getting it nothing that that particular company offers is unique to them nothing they can offer you can not be done by anyone else it is my personal belief that we should not do business with spammers and that is why i suggest you to remember the company name and never deal with them however it is up to you if you want to follow that advice or not what they 're offering is called refinance any bank credit union or mortgage broker does that the rates are more or less the same everywhere but the closing fees and application fees is where the small brokers are making their money big banks get their money from also servicing the loans so they 're more flexible on fees all of them can do streamline refinance if your mortgage is eligible none if it is n't note that the ones who service your current mortgage might not be the ones who own it thus renegotiating the rate is most likely not an option fha backed loans are sold to fannie and freddie the original lenders continue servicing them but do n't own them refinancing is a more likely option and in this case the lender will not care about your rate on the old mortgage

generally it goes by when they receive the check not when they cash the check though if the check was received prior to midnight on december 31st but after the bank closes they would probably let the tax payer decide to count it for the next year of course if the check is from person a to person b then the only issue is gift tax or annual limit calculations   if it is company to person then income tax could be involved   the irs calls this constructive receipt income    under the cash method include in your gross income all items of    income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year if    you receive property or services you must include their fair market    value in income example    on december 30 2011 mrs. sent you a check for interior    decorating services you provided to her you received the check on    january 2 2012 you must include the amount of the check in income    for 2012   constructive receipt    you have constructive receipt of    income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to    you without restriction you do not need to have possession of it if    you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you you    are treated as having received it when your agent received it example     interest is credited to your bank account in december 2012 you do not    withdraw it or enter it into your passbook until 2013 you must    include it in your gross income for 2012   delaying receipt of income     you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to avoid paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction example    jones a service contractor was entitled to receive a $ 10,000    payment on a contract in december 2012 she was told in december that    her payment was available at her request she was not paid until    january 2013 she must include this payment in her 2012 income because    it was constructively received in 2012   checks    receipt of a valid    check by the end of the tax year is constructive receipt of income in    that year even if you can not cash or deposit the check until the    following year example dr. received a check for $ 500 on december 31 2012 from a    patient she could not deposit the check in her business account until    january 2 2013 she must include this fee in her income for 2012 in general it is best not to cut it close if the check is to be counted as an january event it is best to send it in january if it is to be december event it is best to send it early enough to be able to say with confidence that the check arrived at the destination before the end of the year

this question feels like an question to me and so i will treat it as one investment noun form of to invest originally from the latin meaning to means commit money in order to earn a financial return merriam webster online dictionary invest vb tr definition 1 as such when a person commits money with the purpose of earning a financial return they are investing   playing the lottery when done so for the purpose of financial return would fall under this definition even if it 's a poor choice    gambling verb of to gamble likely originally from the word meaning to play means a   to play a game for money or property b   to bet on an uncertain outcome merriam webster online dictionary gamble vb definition 1 playing the lottery is clearly gambling as a lottery is a game by definition the second definition could well include investing in the stock market particularly certain kinds of investments derivatives currency speculation for example aside from the definitions however normal usage clearly favors investment to be something with an expectation of positive return while gambling is taking a risk without that expectation rather with the hope of positive return   legally as well playing the lottery is not something that is considered investment so it is taxed differently   however the question was can and by definition clearly it can be assuming you are not asking legally

the issue with your point is that government has does move to make decisions in the markets to institute their political views or agendas of which these views and agenda do not often take into consideration any of the unforeseen consequences in the light of market realities the market realities which i speak of are everything affected by government action from businesses dealing with the cost of extra added government regulation on their bottom line employee costs taxes the impact of subsidies and price controls etc in a competitive market where everyone is looking for an edge over their competitors however with government many times these market realities are often ignored when making broad and over reaching governmental polices based on political agendas and the whims of the public rather then on solid and sound economic decisions   which in turn these governmental polices effect many many more people then businesses acting for their own needs to ensure their survival in the marketplace thus having a president who does not or willfully will not acknowledge how government interaction in the market place can create unintended and often negative results is worse in respects to having a president who does understand how the bottom line is effected via government action and attempts to reconcile both in light of making a decisions that effects the economy as a whole

the answer is discounted cash flows companies that do n't pay dividends are ostensibly reinvesting their cash at returns higher than shareholders could obtain elsewhere   they are reinvesting in productive capacity with the aim of using this greater productive capacity to generate even more cash in the future this is n't just true for companies but for almost any cash generating project with a project you can purchase some type of productive assets you may perform some kind of transformation on the good or not with the intent of selling a product service or in fact the productive mechanism you have built this productive mechanism is typically called a company what is the value of such a productive mechanism yes it 's capacity to continue producing cash into the future under literally any scenario discounted cash flow is how cash flows at distinct intervals are valued   a company that does not pay dividends now is capable of paying them in the future   berkshire hathaway   does not pay a dividend currently but it 's cash flows have been reinvested over the years such that it 's current cash paying capacity has multiplied many thousands of times over the decades this is why companies that have never paid dividends trade at higher prices microsoft did not pay dividends for many years because the cash was better used developing the company to pay cash flows to investors in later years a companies value is the sum of it 's risk adjusted cash flows in the future even when it has never paid shareholders a dime if you had a piece of paper that obligated an entity such as the government to absolutely pay you $ 1,000 20 years from now this $ 1,000 cash flows present value could be estimated using discounted cash flow it might be around $ 400 for example   but let 's say you want to trade this promise to pay before the 20 years is up   would it be worth anything   of course it would   it would in fact typically go up in value barring heavy inflation until it was worth very close to $ 1,000 moments before it 's value is redeemed imagine that this promise to pay is much like a non dividend paying stock   throughout its life it has never paid anyone anything but over the years it 's value goes up   it is because the discounted cash flow of the $ 1,000 payout can be estimated at almost anytime prior to it 's payout

if you spent your whole life earning the same portfolio that amounts $ 20,000 the variance and volatility of watching your life savings drop to $ 10,000 overnight has a greater consequence than for someone who is young this is why riskier portfolios are n't advised for older people closer to or within retirement age the obvious complementary group being younger people who could lose more with lesser permanent consequence your high risk investment choices have nothing to do with your ability to manage other people 's money unless you fail to make a noteworthy investment return then your high risk approach will be the death to your fund managing aspirations

a derivative contract can be an option and you can take a short sell position much the same way you would in a stock when buying options you risk only the money you put in however when selling do n't have the securities or cash to cover all potential losses options you are borrowing brokers force you to maintain a required amount of cash called a maintenance requirement when selling naked calls theoretically you are able to lose an infinite amount of money so in order to sell this type of options you have to maintain a certain level of cash in your account if you fail to maintain this level you will enter into what s often referred to as a margin call and yes they will call your phone and tell you your broker has the right to liquidate your positions in order to meet requirements ps from experience my broker has never liquidated any of my holdings but then again i 've never been in a margin call for longer then a few days and never with a severe amount the margin requirement for investors is regulated and brokers follow these regulations

i definitely agree with this before i could get federal or state loans i had to do this online orientation and while you probably could skip most of it and click accept i actually read through and am competent in how the interest works and how even though not paying until after graduation is an option that 'll increase my total loans by like 50 almost every other student i 've talked to with student loans has little to no knowledge as to how interest works and how it applies to their loans     and the choosing what to study because while it is nice to study something fun if you ca n't practically get a decent paying job in your field then you have a lot of knowledge and nothing to do with it

one approach is to control your budget more effectively for example work out your essential living expenses things like food rent and other bills you are committed to and compare this to your regular income   then you can set up a regular automatic payment to a savings account so you limit the disposable income in your current account if you keep a regular check on this balance it should make you feel like you have less spare money and so less temptation to spend on impulse purchases   similarly    it may help to set a savings goal for something you really do want even if this is itself   a bit frivolous it will at least help you to discipline yourself   equally it may be useful to set a fixed budget for luxuries then you have a sense that when it 's gone it 's gone but you do n't have to completely deny yourself

for customer accounts that you have with a merchant normally a positive balance in the account is what you owe the merchant when you have a credit on the account or a negative balance it usually means that it is an amount that the merchant owes you this could be because you paid too much or perhaps it is because the merchant is giving you a refund for some reason   however it is always a possibility that this particular merchant is not using the terminology in the conventional way if you are n't sure the best thing to do is to ask the merchant directly by contacting their customer service department   just judging from the screenshot you posted it looks to me like they owe you some money i suggest you click the statement button it looks like that will generate some type of statement that will instruct the merchant to send you a refund but that is only a guess their customer service should be able to tell you what to do

nowhere to back up a bit mutual funds are the stock market and the bond market that is when you invest in a mutual fund your money is ultimately buying stocks on the open market some of it might be buying bonds the exact mix of stocks and bonds depends on the mutual fund but a mutual fund is just a basket of stocks and/or bonds and/or other more exotic investments at 25 you probably should just be investing your roth ira in index stock mutual funds and index bond mutual funds you probably should n't even be doing peer to peer lending unless you 're willing to think of any losses as the cost of a hobby the higher interest rate you 're getting is a reflection of the risk that your borrowers will default i 'm not even sure if peer to peer lending is allowed in roth ira 's   investing in just stocks bonds and cast is boring but these are easy investments to understand the harder the investment is to understand the easier it is for it to be a scam or just a bad investment there 's not necessarily anything wrong with boring

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

i would phrase it this way if someone needs costly procedures especially for conditions they caused themselves then yes those procedures will not be covered and they are not covered in all national healthcare systems in the world   it 's immoral to cover a transplant for a drunk or extended for an obese person while an old lady can not get an aid to stay independent in her home because it 's not covered in the medical insurance   and i have no issue if the aca will be repealed before a replacement is put in place this will be the fastest way to get a replacement   it seems to me that you are not familiar with how national health care systems work and so i will give you personal example of my aunt covered by the excellent national healthcare in israel and i mean it it 's one of the best national health care systems in the world   her locked suddenly and she had to have a hip replacement no problems said the doctors you will get hip replacement totally covered by the insurance but you have to wait 3 months for that so my aunt said but i got supplemental private medical insurance every one smart in israel who can afford it get that why did n't you tell us asked the doctors you will have the hip replacement done next week with better parts and so it happened   my aunt thought that at least the recovery and rehab in the hospital will be covered by her standard insurance so in the morning after the surgery the nurse comes and says please make a choice either i come once in the morning to take you out of bed to the toilet and some rehab or once in the evening   my aunt chose none of the options and paid out of her pocket partially covered by her private insurance to stay in a private hospital   do you get it   but in israel an obese women will get her 3rd artificial to have her 3rd baby + an aid to help her raise her kids because she 's too fat to care of the her children we have that nonsense in israel

your assumption that funds sold in gbp trade in gbp is incorrect in general funds purchase their constituent stocks in the fund currency which may be different to the subscription currency where the subscription currency is different from the fund currency subscriptions are converted into the fund currency before the extra money is used to increase holdings an etf on the other hand does not take subscriptions directly but by creation and redemption of shares the principle is the same however monies received from creation of etf shares are converted into the fund currency and then used to buy stock this ensures that only one currency transaction is done in your specific example the fund currency will be usd so your purchase of the shares assuming there are no sellers and creation occurs will be converted from gbp to usd and held in that currency in the fund the fund then trades entirely in usd to avoid currency risk when you want to sell your exposure supposing redemption occurs enough holdings required to redeem your money are sold to get cash in usd and then converted to gbp before paying you this means that trading activity where there is no need to convert to gbp or any other currency does not incur currency conversion costs in practice funds will always have some cash or cash equivalents on hand to pay out redemptions and will have an idea of the number and size of redemptions each calendar period so will use futures and swaps to mitigate fx risk where the same firm has two funds traded in different currencies with the same objectives it is likely that one is a wrapper for the other such that one simply converts the currency and buys the other currency denominated etf as these are exchange traded funds with a price in gbp the amount you pay for the etf or gain on selling it is the price given and you will not have to consider currency exchange as that should be done internally as explained above however there can be a temporary arbitrage opportunity if the price in gbp does not reflect the price in usd and the exchange rate put together

it is normally a bad idea to cash in retirement accounts to buy a house in your case it is a horrible idea because you are way behind on saving for retirement other fallacies in your reasoning    my advice increase the amount you are saving for retirement considerably and also put some money aside to save for a down payment on a house buy the house when you have enough non retirement money to afford the down payment if you ca n't wait that long buy a house you can afford it may help to think of it this way visualize yourself as a 65 year old retired person with very little income and living on your retirement account would you as a 39 year old ask that person to give you $ the amount you are talking about withdrawing compounded annually at 6 interest for 25 years with no additional contributions so that you could put a down payment on a house because that is what you would be doing when you hit retirement age would you kick yourself for making such a decision because unless you die young that person is sitting out there in your future needing that money to live off of do n't take this the wrong way but the tone of your question seems like you are looking for support to make what you already know is a bad financial decision

i 've consulted with 5 6 accountants and people who 've had the issue before the advice i received boils down to if you do not attach your with your personal tax return it is not effective however you can still correct the requirement to file it along with your tax return because you are within the 3 year window of when the return was originally due so you can amend your return file it late within a certain window and things should be ok the accountants that have confirmed this are and all of them corporate and credible accountants you also need to keep onto the confirmation the irs sent you in case of an audit there is nothing on irs.gov about attaching your on a filed late or amended return but those accountants are people who say they 've seen it happen frequently have consulted with the irs for solutions and that 's the one they 'd advise one to do in such situation disclaimer i am not a cpa

lets consider what would happen if you invested $ plus $ 10k down in a property or did the same in a low cost index fund over the 30 year term that most mortgages take   the returns of either scenarios can not be guaranteed but there are long term analyses that shows the stock market can be expected to return about 7 compounded yearly this does n't mean each year will return 7 some years will be negative and some will be much higher but that over a long span the average will reach 7   using a time value of money calculator that down payment monthly additions of $ 1,500 and a 7 annual return would be worth about $ 1.8 m in 30 years if 1.8 m were invested you could safely withdraw $ for the rest of your life do consider of inflation makes this less than today 's dollar   there are long term analyses that show real estate more or less keeps track with inflation at 2 4 annual returns this does n't consider real estate taxes maintenance insurance and the very individual and localized issues with your market and your particular house is land limited where you are increasing your price will new development drive down your price   in 30 years you 'll own the house outright you 'll still need to pay property tax and insurance on it and you 'll be getting rental income over those 30 years you can expect to replace a roof 2 3 hot water heaters concrete work several trees decades of snow shoveling mowing grass and weeding your hvac system windows and doors and probably a kitchen and bathroom you will have paid about 1.5x the initial price of the mortgage in interest along the way   so you 'll have whatever the rental price for your house monthly probably almost impossible to predict for a single family home plus the market price of your house again very difficult to predict but could safely say it keeps pace with inflation minus your expenses   there are scenarios where you could beat the stock market there are ways to reduce the lifestyle burden of being a landlord   along the way should you want to purchase a house for yourself to live in you 'll have to prove the rental income is steady to qualify for a loan having equity in a mortgage gives you something to borrow against in a heloc of course you could easily end up owing more than your house is worth in that situation   personally i 'd stick to investing that money in low fee index funds

you can keep the cash in your account as long as you want but you have to pay a tax on what 's called capital gains to quote from wikipedia a capital gain is a profit that results from investments into a capital asset such as stocks bonds or real estate which exceeds the purchase price it is the difference between a higher selling price and a lower purchase price resulting in a financial gain for the conversely a capital loss arises if the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset are less than the purchase price thus buying selling stock counts as investment income which would be a capital gain loss when you are filing taxes you have to report net capital gain loss so you do n't pay taxes on an individual stock sale or purchase you pay tax on the sum of all your transactions   note you do not pay any tax if you have a net capital loss taxes are only on capital gains   the amount you are taxed depends on your tax bracket and your holding period a short term capital gain is gain on an investment held for less than one year these gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate a long term capital gain is gain on an investment held for more than one year these gains are taxed at a special rate if your income tax rate is 10 or 15 then long term gains are taxed at 0 i.e. no tax otherwise the tax rate is 15 so you 're not taxed on specific stock sales you 're taxed on your total gain there is no tax for a capital loss and investors sometimes take profits from good investments and take losses from bad investments to lower their total capital gain so they wo n't be taxed as much the tax rate is expected to change in 2013 but the current ratios could be extended until then however the rate is as is   of course this all applies if you live in the united states other countries have different measures hope it helps   wikipedia has a great chart to refer to

with a limited company you 'll have to pay yourself a salary through paye with income from your other job taking you over the higher rate threshold you should inform hmrc of this and get a tax code of do for the second job meaning 40 tax and also both employer 's and employee 's national insurance will be deducted from the whole amount of the salary see here   dividends should be like any other dividend you wo n't pay extra tax when you receive them but will have to declare them on your tax return and pay the tax later see the official information here you 'll get a £ 5,000 tax allowance for dividends but they 'll still count as income for purposes of hitting the higher rate threshold i think in practice this means the first £ 5,000 will be tax free and the rest will be taxed at but note that you have to pay yourself at least the minimum wage as salary not as dividend   i ca n't see being an issue   however i 'm not a professional and this situation is complicated enough to need professional advice talk to an accountant or a tax advisor

at least in the us a cashier 's check is just like a regular personal check only it 's guaranteed by the bank itself so the person accepting it can be pretty certain the check wo n't be returned for insufficient funds if the check is genuine most banks therefore have a policy for cashier 's checks that is very similar to their policies on regular checks and money orders if you are a member with an account in good standing they 'll make all or part of the money available to you according to their fund availability policy which is usually anywhere from immediately to 7 10 days with amounts over $ 5,000 banks will tend to put a hold on the funds to ensure it clears and they get their money if you are not a member then many banks will refuse to cash the check at all unless the cashier 's check is drawn on on that brand of bank so if the cashier 's check is issued by say chase bank chase banks will usually be willing to cash out the entire check to you immediately with properly provided id because the bank is guaranteed by them they are able to check their system and ensure the check is real and can clear the check instantly this policy is n't just up to individual banks entirely as it is defined by united states federal banking policies and federal regulations on availability of funds if you really must cash the check without a holding period and won't can't have a bank account of your own to perform this then you will generally need to go into a branch of the bank that is guaranteeing the check to be able to cash it out fully right away note that since the check might be issued by a bank with no branch near you you should have a back up plan generally banks will allow you to setup a special limited savings only account to deposit your check even if you do n't have a checking account so if no other option works you might try that as well the funds availability policies are the same but at least you 'll be able to cash it generally in 10 days time and then close the account and withdraw your money

the finance buff discusses why the roth 401k is often disadvantaged compared to a traditional 401k in the article the case against the roth 401k including the following reasons paraphrased contributions to the 401k come from the top of your highest tax bracket rate but withdrawals fill in from the bottom   for example suppose you are in the 28 tax bracket   every marginal dollar you contribute to the traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by cents   however when withdrawing the first $ of income is tax free from standard deduction and exemption 2014 numbers $ for married couples joint filing   the next dollars are at the 10 tax bracket and so on   this is an advantage for the traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing a reasonable assumption avoid high state income tax there are many states that have low or no state income tax   if you live in a state with a high income tax paying tax now through the roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate avoid triggering credit many tax credits e.g. student loan interest child tax credit hope credit roth ira eligibility etc begin phasing out as your income increases   contributing to the traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits as described in the article if these items do n't apply contributing to the roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification

what you are looking for is a pretty terrible deal for you so i 'd say it does n't exist because there is n't a market for it or nobody has noticed there is a market for it in principle i would happily take the deal you offer from as many people as would let me put the money into treasury bills and take half the profits while doing pretty much nothing     if i had more risk tolerance i would be pretty happy to have half the value of my fund as zero cost investment capital for more aggressive investments   my business would then be a lot like an insurance company without the hassle of selling insurance to get hold of float to invest   also most insurance companies actually lose money on policies but come out ahead by investing the float so an insurance company with zero cost float is quite a good business another answer mentions berkshire hathaway   if you read one of the famous berkshire hathaway annual letters to shareholders and read the section about insurance you 'll see that very low cost float has a large role in that company 's success so back to your end of the deal if the deal is that good for me how good is it for you   i 'd have to double market returns just for you to break even   if you 're smart enough to pick a financial adviser that can beat the market by that much how come you are n't able to pick an investment strategy that ties the market

the most likely answer to your question regarding what the market expects is perhaps that the market expects that currently linked in like a lot of other startups has been almost it makes into building the business and brand   so right now the net profits are pretty low percentage of income roughly 1.5 of revenue   given the size of the other numbers it does n't take a lot of movement in the right direction to get a big change in that tiny final number   the other factor is the gap between their net and the income available   i think but i 'm making a logical guess here a large part of that gap was paying off the losses of the prior two years   if that 's the case and everything else is static then next year 's available number ought to at least triple   in order to grow the net all li needs is to either continue current trends of growth in expenses relative to costs   keep expenses steady and experience a slight growth in income or find a way to reduce expenses without having it impact income or something in between those three    if we take the first case as an example income has been roughly doubling every year but expenses growing less than that   if they were to continue that but manage to get some economy of scale and have expenses grow at a slower rate then the jump in net income ought to be substantial most of the trends you could project end up with a big growth in the bottom line but yeah i got ta admit none of that gets you growth in a single year   so the conclusion i would draw is that the market is trending a few years out and being pretty optimistic given the current pe ratio   of course you could also conclude that the market is social network happy and represents one of the few opportunities for the average investor to get in on that given that facebook and myspace are not trading on the open market

10 seems to be a little bit too optimistic but annually on average is doable 1 is way too little you 're doing something wrong unless you mean real return i.e. after adjustment for inflation and even then it 's not too high at any given year it may be easy or difficult but the point is that we 're talking about long term averages for example if you look at the dji for the last 30 years you 'll see a rise of 1300 give or take which annually is ~40 in the last 3 years the rise is even steeper but in the last week it is negative so it depends on your time line and the way you manage your investments you 've got to balance between stocks and bonds and cash but even if you park your money in cash you can get more than 1 right now capitol one on line savings is 1.15 and that 's with the lowest rates ever so getting 1 over time does mean that you 're doing something wrong imho

well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable it will be crazy if it truly does come to fruition if they fed treasury realize that they can not inflate their way out of this by printing more money and all of the nay of massive deflation get proven wrong    so the better question is this we believe know it 's coming so how do we prepare and strategically place ourselves to survive profit prosper from the coming collapse   as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    stocks will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    bonds are paying crap and after taxes barely inflation    for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    but for now where do we put our investments to protect and hopefully grow them as the mid term passes

from what i ’ve seen across a multitude of firms the gaps start at recruiting outsourced to a person with a ba from an unknown foreign school and no experience for $ and propagate throughout an organization because accurate metrics for measuring it talent are few and far between    they do n’t realize their ship is sinking until 90 of their costs are maintaining inflexible legacy applications that are n’t even remotely functioning in alignment with their digital strategy anymore and then they hire or or whomever else to come fix it and then when it becomes an clusterfuck of nonsense they pay someone else for managed services until like i do n’t know the business goes under or the building explodes when the ibm mainframe they ’re still using catches fire it ’s truly a fascinating cycle

it is a legitimate practice the dealers do get the loan money up front because they 're not holding the loan themselves they promptly sell it to someone else or more commonly just act as salesmen for a lending institution and take their profit as commission or origination fees the combined deal is often not a good choice for the consumer though remember that the dealer 's goal is to close a sale with maximum profit if they 're offering to drop the price $ 2k they either did n't expect to actually get that price in the first place or expect at least $ 2k of profit from the loan or some combination of these standard advice is to negotiate price loan and trade in separately first get the dealer 's best price on the car compare it to other dealer and other cars and walk away if you do n't like their offer repeat for the loan checking the dealer 's offer against banks credit unions available to you if you have an older car to unload get quotes for it and consider whether you might do better selling it yourself = = = = = = = = = standard unsolicited plug for reports car facts service if you 're buying a new car which is n't usually the best option late model used is generally a better value for a small fee they can tell you what the dealer 's real cost of a car is after all the hidden incentives and rebates that lets you negotiate directly on how much profit they need on this sale and focuses their attention on the fact that the time they spend haggling with you is time they could be using to sell the next one simply walking into the dealer with this printout in your hand cuts out a lot of nonsense the one time i bought new i basically walked in and said it 's the end of the model year i 'll give you $ 500 profit to take one of those off your hands before the new ones come in if you 've got one configured the way i want it closed the deal on the spot the only concession i had to make was on color   it does n't always work some salesmen are idiots in that case you walk away and try another dealer i am not affiliated in any way with cu or the automotive or lending industries except as customer and yes this touch keyboard is typo prone

just so i 'm the end result is a long call and you think the stock is going up there is nothing wrong with that fundamentally   be aware though that 's a negative theta trade this means if your stock does n't increase in price during the remaining time to expiration of your call option the option will lose some of its value every day it may still lose some of its value every day depending on how much the stock price increases the value of the call option just goes down and down as it approaches maturity even if the stock price stays about the same being long a call or a put is a tough way to make money in the options market   i would suggest using an out of the money butterfly spread the potential returns are a bit less however this is a cheap positive theta trade so you avoid time decay on the value of the option

not missing anything excess cash is somewhat of a nebulous concept to different people it means different things the answer is that excess cash varies for each company depending on their business for instance some companies need very high amounts of working capital a company may be increasing their inventories and therefore will require more cash on their balance sheet to fund growth if a company always needs this extra cash some investors prefer to leave that cash out of a valuation because the company can not run profitably without it think about what happens to your calculation of enterprise value if you subtract excess cash as opposed to cash excess cash is always less than cash therefore by subtracting excess cash you increase ev since one common valuation metric is ev ebitda a higher numerator will make the stock seem more expensive that is the ev ebitda ratio will seem higher when using excess cash as opposed to cash so using excess cash in your valuation methodology is basically a conservative concept depending on the business 20 of revenues seem way too high as a reserve for excess cash 2 is a much better rule of thumb

hobby expenses are not tax deductible   business expenses are but only if it 's a bona fide business   first they look at profitability if you reported a net profit i.e. paid taxes in your first 3 years they will believe you rant on youtube for a living    remember by the time they get around to auditing you you 'll likely be well into or through your third year    there is an exception for farms   other than that if you lose money year after year you better be able to show that you look walk and like a business and one with a reasonable business reason for delayed profitability   for instance netflix 's old business model of mailing dvds had very high fixed infrastructure expense that took years to turn profitable but was a very sensible model   they 're fine with that   pets.com into oblivion but they tried they 're fine with that too   you ca n't mix all your activities if you 're an electrician specializing in iot and smart homes can you deduct a trip to the trade show you bet   conference arguable   ses   no way   now if you had a second business of a product site which profited by ads and affiliate links then ses would be fine to deduct from that business   but if this second business loses money every year it 's a hobby and not deductible at all   that person would want separate accounting books for the electrician and businesses   that 's a basic duck test of a business vs. a hobby you need to be able to show how each business gets income and pays expense separate from every other business and your personal life   it 's a best practice to give each business a separate checking account and checkbook you do n't need to risk tax penalties on a business that may never   you can amend your taxes up to 3 years after the proper filing date   i save my expense for each tax year and if a business becomes justifiable i go back and amend past years tax forms taking those deductions   irs gives me a refund check with interest

note this answer is true for the uk other places may vary there are a couple of uses for credit cards   the first is to use them in a revolving manner if you pay off the bill in full every time you get one then with the vast majority of cards you will pay no interest delay your expenses by a month build your credit rating and with many credit cards you can also get rewards generally you should wait until the bill comes to pay it off this ensures that your usage is reported to the credit ratings agencies in general you should not draw out cash on credit cards as there is usually a fee and unlike purchases it will start interest immediately the second is longer term borrowing this is where you have to be careful firstly the standard rate on most credit cards is 20 apr which is pretty high secondly on many cards once you are carrying a balance any purchases start interest immediately however many credit cards offer promotional rates in contrast to the standard rates which are an expensive way to borrow the promotional rates often allow you to borrow at 0 apr for some period usually when it comes to promotional rates you get the best deal by opening a new credit card and using it immediately   ideally you should plan to pay off the card before the 0 period ends if you ca n't do that then a balance transfer may be an option but be aware than in a few years the market for credit cards may or may not have changed whatever you do you should always make sure to pay at least the minimum payment and do so on time not doing so may trigger steep fees loss of promotional interest rates there is a site called that tracks the best deals

adapted from an answer to a somewhat different question generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over your 401k assets into an ira but i do n't think that is the case here   if you had a traditional 401k the assets will roll over into a traditional ira if it was a roth 401k into a roth ira if you had started a little earlier you could have considered considered converting part or all of your traditional ira into a roth ira assuming that your 2012 taxable income will be smaller this year because you have quit your job of course this may still hold true in 2013 as well   as to which custodian to choose for your rollover ira i recommend investing in a low cost index   mutual fund such as vfinx which tracks the s&p 500 index then do not look at how that fund is doing for the next thirty years   this will save you from the common error made by many investors when they pull out at the first downturn and thus end up buying high and selling low also do not chase after exchange traded mutual funds or etfs as many will likely recommend until you have acquired more savvy or interest in investing than you are currently not knowing which company stock you have it is hard to make a recommendation about selling or holding on but since you are glad to have quit your job you might want to consider making a clean break and selling the shares that you own in your ex employer 's company keep the $ 35 k less the $ 12 k that you will use to pay off the student loan as your emergency fund pay off your student loan right away since you have the cash to do it

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

it 's been said before but to repeat succinctly a company 's current share price is no more or less than what the market thinks that share is worth as measured by the price at which the shares are being bought and sold as such a lot of things can affect that price some of them material others a common reason to own stock is to share the profits of the company by owning 1 share out of 1 million shares outstanding you are entitled to of that company 's quarterly profits if any these are paid out as dividends two key measurements are based on these dividend payments the first is earnings per share which is the company 's stated quarterly profits divided by outstanding shares with the second being the price earnings ratio which is the current price of the stock divided by its eps your expected yield on this stock is more or less the inverse of this number if a company has a p e ratio of 20 then all things being equal if you invest $ 100 in this stock you can expect a return of $ 5 or 5 1/20 as such changes in the expected earnings per share can cause the share price to rise or fall to maintain a p e ratio that the pool of buyers are willing to tolerate news that a company might miss its profit expectations due to a decrease in consumer demand an increase in raw materials costs labor financing or any of a multitude of things that industry analysts watch can cause the stock price to drop sharply as people look for better investments with higher yields however a large p e ratio is not necessarily a bad thing especially for a large stable company that stability means the company is better able to weather economic problems and thus it is a lower risk now not all companies issue dividends apple is probably the most well known example the company simply retains all its earnings to reinvest in itself this is typically the strategy of a smaller start up whether they 're making good money or not they typically want to keep what they make so they can keep growing and the shareholders are usually fine with that why well because there 's more than one way to value a company and more than one way to look at a stock owning one share of a stock can be seen quite literally as owning a share of that company the share can then be valued as a fraction of the company 's total assets   sounds simple but it is n't because not every asset the company owns has a line in the financial statements a company 's brand name for instance has no tangible value and yet it is probably the most valuable single thing apple owns similarly intellectual property does n't have a book value on a company 's balance sheet but again these are huge contributors to the success and profitability of a company like apple the company is viewed as a center of innovation and if it were not doing any innovating it would very quickly be seen as a middleman for some other company 's ideas and products a company ca n't sustain that position for long even if it 's raking in the money in the meantime overall the value of a company is generally a combination of these two things by owning a portion of stock you own a piece of the company 's assets and also claim a piece of their profits a large company with a lot of material assets and very little debt can be highly valued based solely on the sum of its parts even if profits are lagging conversely a company more or less operating out of a storage unit can have a patent on the cure for cancer and be shoveling money into their coffers with

you are forgetting one crucial point regarding the money supply   the us federal reserve increases the money supply meaning some of the money is not really loaned it just appears out of nowhere   at first glance this seems even worse over the short term the fed changes the money supply to help the economy in whatever way it sees fit   but over the long term the money supply increases to reflect economic growth   as new technology is introduced more can be accomplished with the same labor and resources and thus the money supply needs to be increased   money is really just a convenient replacement for the barter system so if there are more things to barter for goods and services then there should also be more things to barter with money also keep in mind inflation   the cost of goods and services goes up over time due to the inflation of currency and so the money supply must also be increased so that those goods and services do not artificially increase in value which would be very bad

the answer to your question depends on what you mean when you say growth   if you mean a literal increase in the aggregate market capitalization of companies across the entire market then no this sort of growth is not possible without economic growth   the reason why is that the market capitalization of each company is proportional to its gross revenue and the sum of all revenue from selling final goods i.e. things purchased and used by consumers is apart from a few technicalities the definition of gdp   the exact multiplier might fluctuate up or down depending on investors expectations about how sales will grow or decline going forward but in a zero growth economy this multiplier should be stable over the long run   it might however still fluctuate over the short term but more about that in a minute    note that all of this applies to aggregate growth across all firms   individual firms can still grow of course but as they must do this by gaining market share from other companies such growth would be balanced by a decline for some other firm   also i 've assumed zero net exports that 's one of the technicalities i mentioned above because obviously you could have export driven growth even if the domestic economy were stationary however often when people talk about growth in the market what they really mean is return   that is how much does your investment earn for you   this is n't really the same thing as growth but people often think of it that way particularly in the saving phase of their investing career when they are reinvesting their returns and therefore their account balances are growing   it is possible to have a positive return averaged across the market even in a stationary economy   the reason why is that there are really only two things a firm can do with its net profits   one possibility is that it could invest it in growing the business   however there is not much point in doing that in a stationary economy because by assumption no increase in aggregate consumption and therefore in the long run aggregate production are possible   therefore firms are left with only the second option which is to pay them out to investors as dividends   those dividends provide a return that is independent of economic growth would the stock market still be a good investment in such an economy   yes   well sort of   the rate of return from firms dividend payouts will depend on investors demand in aggregate for returns on their investments   stock prices will rise or fall causing returns to respectively fall or rise to find that level   if your personal desire for returns is lower than the average across the investing public then the stock market would look like a good investment   if your desired return is higher than the average then it will look like a poor investment   the marginal investor will of course be indifferent   the practical upshot of this is that the people who invest in the stock market in this scenario will be precisely the ones for whom the stock market is a good investment given their personal propensity to save and desire for returns and so forth finally you mentioned that in your scenario the gdp stagnation is due to declining population   i am less certain what this means for investment but my first thought is that you would have a large retired population selling its investments to fund late life consumption and you would have a comparatively small relative to history working population buying those assets   this would lead to low asset prices and therefore high rates of return   however that 's assuming that retirees need to sell assets to fund their retirement consumption   if the absolute returns on retirees assets are large enough to fund their retirement consumption then you would wind up with relatively few sellers resulting in high prices and therefore relatively low rates of return   it 's not obvious to me which effect would dominate and so it 's hard to say whether or not the resulting returns would look attractive to the working age population

typically labor is a company 's largest expense so when a company receives tax cuts that does n't translate to more hiring long term if the company expands it might but it could also choose to invest in a better or different products maybe more efficient business processes or invest in overseas operations additionally labor has a diminishing value just because we could hire more people to make more things does n't mean we should    side note in many states the largest employers are the state local governments schools public services etc and healthcare providers   this tax cut is great for people that are already invested or high income earners because it lowers the overall tax brackets and aligns capital gains to those so say i had a million dollars invested and earned a yearly 10 dividend return i 'd earn 100k in dividends and pay 25 as income tax source   however something like 50 of all americans are invested in the stock market only the top 10 average investments close to a million in investments example above and 38 of all investments are owned by the 1 source   tax cuts while popular would n't ever help stimulate consumer spending esp considering the amount of consumer debt that exists ~1 trillion what these tax cuts would do create more debt for tax payers

although not required 2 would work best if you used magnetic ink that is an extra cost which you may or may not want to pay for you can often get a free checking account and a free set of checks if you can meet the minimum requirements this often means a higher average daily balance direct deposit or some combination of multiple requirements the bank is taking a risk that a client meeting those minimum requirements while likely earn the bank more in fees and services than what they give out for free such as the account and checks my wife and i opened a wells fargo checking account two years ago back then we were able to open the account for free along with a free set of 250 checks i think the requirement now requires $ 7,500 average daily balance

it is a rather complex system but here is a rough summary interbank tranfers ultimately require a transfer of reserves at the central bank as a concrete example the bank of england system is the rtgs only the clearing banks and similar e.g. bacs have access to rtgs you can send a chaps payment fairly quickly but that costs chaps immediately triggers an rtgs transfer once the sending bank agrees and so you can be certain that the money is being paid   hence its use for large amounts bacs also sits on the rtgs but to keep costs down it batches tranfers up because we are talking about bank reserve movements checks have to be in place and that can take time furthermore the potential for fraud is higher than chaps since these are transactions a layer removed so a delay reduces the chance of payment failing after apparently being sent faster payments is a new product by bacs that speeds up the bacs process by doing a number of transfers per day hence the two hour clearing for safety it can only be used for up to 10k second tier banks will hold accounts with clearing banks so they are another step down foreign currency transfers require the foreign central bank reserve somewhere and so must be by at least one clearing bank in that country different countries are at different stages in their technology   uk clearing is standard now but us is a little behind i believe   much of europe is speeding up rather like bitcoin clearing you have a choice between speed and safety if you wait you are more certain the transaction is sound and have more time to bust the transfer

i am going to add just one more item to what are some very well thought out answers the element of cash out if you are taking out 80 of the value of the home that you already own free and clear the bank considers this a cash out transaction meaning you would effectively walk away from closing with a check for 80 of your home 's value so in a hypothetical situation you have a $ 200,000 home value you would be handed a check for $ 160,000 with which you could do anything that you wanted granted you are likely going to do something responsible with it and purchase another home but big but the bank ca n't control what you do with it and that is the part they do n't like and therefore they treat these types of transactions with a higher degree of scrutiny it is all about control if the property you are downsizing to fits their rules for lending they may actually loan you a higher loan to value on that purchase than they would on your cash out refinance transaction on your current home   with the purchase loan the money you get goes immediately to the purchase of a new home   in the cash out transaction it goes to a check with which you could do anything you want   and then not pay the loan back   i know no one here would do that but there are some folks that would and this is one of the reasons cash out loans are not nearly as easy as they once were to get

it all depends on how you feel about your employer   obviously you had positive feelings about yours but often that 's not the case   gt;it 's not a good idea to leave anywhere even if you hate it on bad terms it gives everyone there a bad sense of you and can come back to bite you in the future   i think this is actually bad advice   treating bad employers well is sending them the wrong message and encourages them to continue treating people poorly   while i would n't suggest to set the building on fire before you leave or to leave a piece of shit in your desk drawer there is really no need to be extra nice to an employer who has been a major dick to you   the dick employers treat their employees as replaceable resources so it 's only appropriate to return the favor by treating your employer in precisely the exact same way

the assumption that bonds have been issued with a negative coupon is not correct or at least is has not occurred thus far   we 'll look at this future possibility in the final paragraph for now lets look at the current bond market the issuance of government bonds which carry a negative gross redemption yield is the result of governments issuing bonds at an issue price which exceed the nominal redemption price and any coupon yield receivable over the life of the bond   i can find no instances of bonds with a negative coupon though many have tiny positive coupon yields the short seller of a bond with a negative gross redemption yield will be liable to pay the buyer the interest amount determined by the coupon   if the short seller has borrowed the bonds in order to sell them then the short seller will receive the interest due from the lender to offset the interest paid to the buyer   if the short seller has not borrowed the bonds but has sold them using some sort of synthetic contract such as a contract for difference then the short seller will pay the coupon without receiving any offsetting payment i thought this was an interesting question and it will be interesting to see if at some time in the future governments do ever issue bonds with a negative coupon   to date this does not appear to have happened so what would happen if we assume that a government issues a bond with a negative coupon   the buyer of the bond would be required to pay the equivalent yield to the government according to the bond contract specification   if an investor sells short such a bond they would then become entitled to receive the interest from the buyer   if they have borrowed the bonds in order to sell them short then they would pay any interest received back to the lender this chain should eventually end with the ultimate owner lender paying the government their dues   if they have sold short using a synthetic contract then presumably they would keep the interest from themselves

that 's a bit more nuanced than it seems    the argument is that on balance the government does not create wealth through value added services particularly when compared to private enterprise that voluntary trade creates mutually beneficial outcomes but involuntary taxation is at best a wealth transfer and at worst inefficient use of capital that leaves people worse off than they would be without it   i mean your characterization is n't totally unfair but it is n't exactly right either

unquestionably i think the priority should be funding retirement through roth k over hsa extra   obviously you need to fund your hsa for reasonable and expected medical expenses   also there is some floor to your more traditional retirement funding beyond that what does one do with excess dollars   given the lack of flexibility and fees it seems clear to do roth ira and 401k. beyond that what then   you may want to decide to take some money home and pay taxes on it   do you have a desire to own rental property or start purchase a business   upgrade your home etc if all those things are taken care of only then would i put money into an hsa ymmv but most people maxing a roth ira alone will have plenty of money for retirement given a reasonable rate of return

a lot of this example is idealistic and the analysis stops right at the point the loan is issued     if you use generous interest rates you could just skirt by the bare minimum debt service coverage ratio for an asset backed loan if you found a lender to approve it   however he does n't address any of the issues of running a business that will be insolvent if expenses rise more than about ~2 above the monthly average in a given month those pesky period months equipment repairs heating cooling in winter summer etc or you have a similarly small in sales selling in january     most companies doing lbos have skin in it and a plan to make the company more valuable not run it exactly the way it is this allows them to either acquire more debt capital than just a percentage of the collateral and so they can finance capital projects to improve the business deal with fluctuations in cash flow and/or implement plans to increase the free cash flows above how it was running previously   this site 's advice is a bit like teaching someone the basics of how to take off in an airplane and then telling them they 're ready to fly

you are correct that 20 has an impact on your interest rate although it is not always hugely significant   you would have to do your own shopping around to find that information out   however 20 has an impact that i consider to be far more important than your monthly payment and that is in your equity   if the dc market tanks which i know it has not really done like much of the country but none of us have crystal balls to know if it will or not then you will be more easily underwater the less you put down   conversely putting 20 or more down makes you an easy sell to lenders means that you do n't have to worry nearly so much about having to do a short sale in the future i would never buy a house with less than 20 down personally and have lived well below my means to get there but i am not you with regards to mortgages the way that i found information that i needed was to get books from the library that explained the mortgage process to me   when it came time to select an actual broker i used my realtor 's recommendation because i trusted my realtor to actually have my interests at heart because he was an old family friend you ca n't usually do that so i do n't recommend it and that of others i knew who had bought recently   i compared four lenders and competed them against each other to get the best terms   they will give you estimate sheets that help you weigh not only rates but costs of different fees such as the origination fee and discount points   make sure to know what fees the lender controls and what fees s)he does n't so that you know which lines to actually compare beyond a lender make sure that before closing you have found a title company that you think is a good choice your realtor or lender will try to pick one for you because that 's the way the business is played but it is a racket pick one who will give you the best deal on title a company may be title company lender or other that wo n't charge you an excessive amount a survey company that you like if required in dc for your title insurance and homeowner 's insurance coverage that you think is a good deal   the time between contract and closing is short and nobody tells you to research all the closing costs that on a $ 500,000 place run to in excess of $ 10,000 but you should   also know that your closing costs will be about 2 of the purchase price and plan accordingly in general take some time to educate yourself on as well as neighborhoods and price ranges   do n't rush into this process or you will lose a lot of money fast

the is per year not per month so you will be getting about 1 k per year just for sitting around on your some important things it is almost certain that you can earn a better interest rate elsewhere if you are prepared to leave your 100 k untouched for example even in natwest you can earn 3.2 over the next year if you buy a fixed rate bond for 100 k that is certainly worth looking at or maybe put 90 k in a fixed rate bond and leave 10 k in an instant access account taxes should not be a problem since you can earn around 7 k before you start paying taxes however be aware that in the uk most bank accounts deduct tax at source that means they send the tax they think you should have paid to the government and you then have to claim it back from them accounts for young people may work differently ask your bank

i 'm guessing since i do n't know the term but it sounds like you 're asking about the technique whereby a loan is used to gather multiple years gift allowance into a single up front transfer for the subsequent n years the giver pays the installments on the loan for the recipient at a yearly amount small enough to avoid triggering gift tax you still have to pay income tax on the interest received even though you 're giving them the money to pay you and you must charge a certain minimum interest or more accurately if you charge less than that they tax you as if the loan was earning that minimum historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile but between the great recession and the internet this has become much more widely known and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork have a lawyer sanity check it for your local laws file the official mortgage lien not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes and provide a payments processing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient or whatever subset of those services you need   i 've done this in my case it cost me a bit under $ 1000 to set up the paperwork so i could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan not a gift the amount in question was large enough and the interpersonal issues tricky enough that this was a good deal for us obviously run the numbers family loan   will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and ca n't do along with services specializing in these transactions note if you are actually selling something such as your share of a house this dance may or may not make sense again run the numbers and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web go not to the internet for legal advice for it shall say both mu and ni

this ignores that physical stores are losing market share at an accelerating rate yes if we freeze time now and pretend things will always be this way brick and mortar has only lost 10 of their sales revenue but a big reason people opt for the store is because they receive their purchases instantly same day delivery combined with technologies like self driving and drone delivery will give online stores low- or no fee instant gratification on top of lower prices no traffic and no gas costs online stores will continue to gain market share

are financial institutions less likely to lend me money because of my age yes   but they are especially unlikely to loan you money because you have little income    or because they know i avoid interest by paying things off aggressively this wo n't affect them   but you might ask yourself how much credit history you have   credit history can include all of loans credit cards rent utilities etc   you mention three loans   but you do n't mention rent or utilities   you may simply not have much credit history even if what you do have is good    but again the biggest thing that they will look at is your income history   if you have a small income then it does n't matter what your payment history is   they do n't want to loan money to people who need money   they want to loan money to people who do n't need to borrow but are instead bringing a future purchase into the present    the ideal recipient is someone who has a high income and spends it all every month   such a person is likely to borrow heavily but be able to keep up the payments    obsessing about your ability to borrow is probably the wrong approach   instead focus on how you can meet your goals without borrowing   eventually your ability to pay will catch up   then they 'll offer you money   of course you might not need it then    note that when i say little income i 'm talking about their perspective   you may be fully on track and making decent money or even very good money for your age   but they 're looking for people who are mature in their careers and regularly bringing home large sums but who spend it faster than they can get it

i am not a financial advisor but i an tell you what i did in exactly this situation which is pretty much what you are proposing   i put money into the offset savings account until i had only a small amount of mortgage balance left less than a year 's worth of mortgage payments then i set it up so that each month i did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself this depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero this was self sustaining and meant that i kept the same margin owing over time i.e. if i was in this situation for 5 years for the whole 5 years i would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage meanwhile since i now did n't have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income i put any spare money into isa savings no need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the isa the benefits of this as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already were that i kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount i could withdraw all the offset savings pot if i wanted to although i would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently and as that liquidity went down over time i was building up other savings in parallel it worked well for me it almost does n't matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high

you keep claiming higher taxes will do x when history shows you that 's not entirely true        we need to both rein in spending and change where the remaining money is spent in the budget we also need to take the wealthy at a higher rate so that the burden is equal to the proportion of wealth in this country that they own framing it as an either or is a logical fallacy

gt i would dare say that in most cases people end up paying more in taxes because they pay it as regular income rather than ltcg   that 's not how it works   there 's no ltcg tax on roth accounts   and on regular investment accounts you 're taxed twice   you first pay regular income tax and then pay ltcg tax on any gains   the main advantage of 401ks is that you do n't ever pay capital gains tax   you 're only taxed once on the money

skinny body care offers a single aka skinny fiber and makes many claims as to what it can do for you   lowers your appetite by helping you feel fuller increases your metabolism leading to increased fat burning raises your energy levels and mood sex drive and harmful waste from your body   i did find testimonials of skinny body care successfully helping people lose weight most of these claims are from agents building the business   i would rather like to see unbiased results from rep customers   one strong point is that skinny body care is affordable priced at $ 60 w s and $ 90 retail monthly cost however they do have major competition from similar products in this competitive market   the skinny body care pay plan is somewhat unique they have a forced matrix structure that they claim anyone can earn $ per month without personal sponsoring   although this may appear promising i doubt anyone will make this income just by signing up my opinion if you just want to make $ 500 to $ 2,000 a month this may be an ok company to join however due to the low commission pay structure it will take a very large to make walk away residual income

1040es uses the smaller number because that 's what triggers the penalties   that is you are penalized if what you prepay is less than your total 2013 liability and less than 90 of your 2014 liability   however estimated taxes are just estimates   if you pay too little you could face a penalty but there 's no penalty for paying too much you 'll just get a refund as usual it seems that your concern stems from the fact that this is the first year you 're in this tax situation and so you 're unsure if your estimates are accurate   in your comment to pete 's answer you also indicated you are n't worried about being unable to pay but only about accidentally underpaying in this case you could just err on the side of caution and pay more than 1040es says you owe   you do n't actually file the 1040es the calculations are just for your own use   for instance you could prepay based on the higher of your two estimates if you can afford it or if you ca n't afford that much hedge the estimate payments up a bit to an amount you can afford that is closer to the higher estimate   at the end of the year if you paid too much you can get a refund as usual   after this year you will presumably have a better sense of your income and your tax liability and can make more accurate estimates for next year

talk to your bank first but shop around a bit as well with other reputable lenders in your area   another option if you 're willing to put down of the purchase price would be to talk to several dealerships before you set foot on a single lot tell them that you are interested in buying a versa and that you are willing to pay cash but you are not willing to pay more than $ they wo n't agree trust me on that but they will come down from $ 13,000 say thanks i 'll call you back and call one of the other dealerships on your list and tell them i just spoke with this dealership and they are willing to sell me the car for whatever number they gave you one of two things will happen either the dealership will come back with a lower price or they will tell you to go buy the car there continue this process until you have one dealership left   i did this with 3 dealerships in 2011 and bought a truck with a $ 27,000 sticker price for just over $ it took about a week to make all of the calls and i ended up going to a dealership 3 hours away but it was worth it for $ 8,000

paying out dividends and financing new projects with debt also lessens the agency problem the consequences of a failed project are greater when debt is used so the manager now has a greater incentive to see that the project is a success this in addition to the paid divided is a benefit to the shareholder if equity was n't paid out and instead used for the project then the manager may not be so interested in its success and if it 's a failure then the shareholders are worse off

ditto nate in many ways but let me add some other thoughts btw there are not four types of account but five you 're forgetting equity also called capital would it be possible to design an accounting system that does not have 5 types of accounts maybe is simpler in other ways and is internally consistent and logical i 'm sure it is but what 's the advantage   as nate points out the existing system has been in use for hundreds of years lots of people know how it works and understand it   i 'd add people have long since worked out how to deal with all the common situations and 99 of the odd cases you 're likely to hit if you invent your own system you 're starting from scratch you 'd have to come up with conventions to handle all sorts of situations how do i record buying a consumable with cash how do i record buying a capital asset with credit how do i record paying off debts how do i record depreciation etc etc if you worked at it long and hard enough and you 're a reasonably bright guy maybe you could come up with solutions to all the problems but why   if you were approaching this saying i see these flaws in the way accounting is done today i have an idea for a new better way to do accounting i 'd say good luck you have a lot of work ahead of you working out all the details to make a fully functioning system and then others to use it but if you really do have a better idea maybe you can revolutionize the world of accounting but the present system is too much trouble and i do n't want to bother to learn it i think that 's a mistake the work involved in inventing your own system is going to end up being way more than what it would take to learn the existing system as to are n't liabilities a lot like assets well in a sense i suppose a credit card is like a checking account in that you can use it to pay for things but they 're very different too from an accounting point of view with a checking account you buy something and then the money is gone so there 's one transaction reduce cash and increase office supplies or whatever but with a credit card there has to be a second transaction when you pay off the charge so step 1 increase debt and increase office supplies step 2 decrease debt and decrease cash credit cards charge interest well you do n't pay interest to use your own cash etc one of the of double entry book keeping is that every transaction involves a debit and a credit of equal amounts or a set of debits and credits where the total of the debits equals the total of the credits if you combine assets and liabilities into whatever you call it balance accounts say then some transactions would involve a matching debit and credit while others would involve a positive debit and a matching negative debit and no credit i 'm sure you could make such a system work but one of the neat built in protections against error is lost there 's a very logical distinction between things that you have or that others owe you and things that you owe to others it makes a lot of sense to want to list them separately and manage them separately i think you 'd pretty quickly find yourself saying well we have two types of balance accounts those that represent things we have and which normally have positive balances which we list on chart a and those that represent things we owe and which normally have negative balances which we list on chart b and before you know it you 've just assets and liabilities

you can spend the money quite quickly the problem is that if there is something wrong with the check the bank will ask you for the money back if the check is from a trusted source a trusted friend a business with good reputation etc that 's fine if the money is from an source make sure that having to pay back the money does n't get you into trouble since most people are honest this is fine for a small amount but if it 's more than you can afford to pay back do n't spend it   a simple scam is that people send you checks by mistake the check is for the wrong amount say $ instead of $ 190 and they ask you to send the difference back so you put $ into your account send them $ 720 and six weeks later your bank asks for their $ back if someone pays you too much on a check and asks you to pay them the difference you know it is a scam

most financial guru 's recommend between three and six months of savings modified by how likely you think it is you 'll lose your job   note that the months here are months of expenses not income dave ramsey on the other hands recommends saving only $ 1000 until you 've paid all debts except your home   this strategy only makes sense if you 're paying off debt very aggressively since you have many relatively small debts you would benefit greatly from the debt snowball recent research shows it 's more effective in practice than paying off high interest first   as you quickly pay off the smaller loans you reduce the amount you must pay each month reducing your risk your emergency fund now goes that much farther and enabling you to put more on the next debt   in your particular case the debt snowball would be etc    again this is good because it quickly reduces your monthly required debt payments

i think it really depends on how much you take out of your nationwide account each month at a certain point it will become cheaper just to transfer your monthly rent + living allowance via an international bank transfer or using one of the currency transfer services like xe.com or you will have to pay fees either way and/or you 'll end up with a forex spread if you have got enough money in your uk account to cover several months worth of expenses in germany i would be tempted to make one big transfer every few months instead of a a monthly one anything more than once a month is probably going to be too costly either way it might also be worth comparing the transfer fees charged by the various banks when i lived in the uk and had to regularly send money to germany i found there was a massive difference between different banks for essentially the same service

as the other answer said the person who owns the lent stock does not benefit directly   they may benefit indirectly in that brokers can use the short lending profits to reduce their fees or in that they have the option to short other stocks at the same terms    follow up question what prevents the broker lending the shares for a very short time less than a day pocketing the interest and returning the lenders their shares without much change in share price because borrowing period was very short what prevents them from doing that many times a day lack of market    short selling for short periods of time is n't so common as to allow for many times a day   some day traders may do it occasionally but i do n't know that it would be a reliable business model to supply them   if there are enough people interested in shorting the stock they will probably want to hold onto it long enough for the anticipated movement to happen    there are transaction costs here   both fees for trading at all and the extra charges for short sale borrowing and interest   most stocks do not move down by large enough amounts many times a day   their fluctuations are smaller   if the stock does n't move enough to cover the transaction fees then that seller lost money overall   over time sellers like that will stop trading as they will lose all their money    all that said there are no legal blocks to loaning the stock out many times just practical ones   if a stock was varying wildly for some bizarre reason it could happen

i really does depend on the bank here is a fairly typical page on interest calculations the key phrase is interest is calculated on each day 's final balance and paid monthly   so at the end of each day the amount of interest is calculated for that day based on how much is in the account at the end of the month the amount of interest for each day is and added to the account balance that calculation is extremely similar to duffbeer703 's compound monthly using the average balance for the month provided the account does n't have tiered interest rates and the balance does n't go negative the software that banks use is easily sophisticated enough to handle that kind of calculation your bank should be able to give you a statement of exactly how the interest is calculated

there are a lot of good answers but i will share my experience   first a savings account needs to be for savings if your in the us you have regulation d to deal with and that will bite you on the rear if you go over those limits specially easy to do if your purchasing from a savings account   next having an income account and a spending account can be a very good tool to build a nest egg so for example you get $ 1500 into your income account and then move $ 1000 to your spending account then budget based on that $ 1000 this is an amazing thing to do so long as you have the discipline to never transfer that extra $ 500 and pretend your broke when you run out of the $ 1000   that being said there is no reason that you ca n't do that in one account it 's all preference my wife and i use ynab an envelope budgeting system to do just that we do n't need the separate accounts we are no more likely to not spend in one account then we are to not spend in two accounts it 's all just self discipline and what you need to do   this does lead to the situation we call ynab broke it 's when we have to start choosing between   going hungry or getting that new dvd even though our bank account has $ 5,000 in it   it 's even harder when you choose go hungry and have to follow through with it even though you have enough to buy a used car in your bank account   but rather it 's ynab broke or your spending account is empty and your income account it full the result is the same it 's up to you to have the self discipline not to spend rather that 's in one account or two makes little difference

gt this is probably the single most clueless statement i 've read about business ever actually made me laugh    because you are clueless do you know how many ads i see on the internet every day zero i see zero ads and every person i talk to sees zero ads because i tell them about ad blockers and they tell their friends and so on and so on   i advertise on reddit and i pay for impressions so every 1k impressions i pay a certain amount but they have no way of knowing if those impressions are actually seen or not they can use sophisticated scripts to determine if the ads are blocked but there are sophisticated ad blockers designed to block just those kinds of things this is a war and in the end ad blockers are going to win this war so why would anyone pay for advertising   advertising is dead it 's dying and if marketers ca n't find a new way to make money they will die with it

i think raising it is ok but not to 15 dollars that s ridiculous i am a minimum wage worker i work 30 hours a week currently plus high school so from my point of view i think we should raise it by maybe or 1.25 i only pay two bills a 125 dollar car payment and 240 insurance my expenses for gas those are my only expenses that i can not cut and even after just that i have very little left to save but with a dollar or so more an hour ot would increase my saving potential by alot and give me a little more breathing room   i am an and inexperienced i do not deserve 15 an hour but i feel like 8.50 is reasonable

it 's a serious problem for traditional cinema while i personally really enjoyed some recent films less critically like ghost in the shell 's remake and more widely well received films like it and blade runner the industry is clearly in a slump numbers wise   with netflix amazon hulu youtube and of course it is harder to get as many people to the cinemas consistently    it 's a bit sad at the surface it would seem that if a series of really quality however imperfect fall blockbuster films like it and and can not sufficiently act as a for the industry it 's not the type quality of movies that are the only problem    we 're still getting plenty of action movies superhero movies disney family movies war movies classic and but people are choosing to go less     for the foreseeable future this is the new normal   fewer people are to movie theatres and the ones that do will go less often   cinema and film companies are going to need to work within a model where a film opens to less people and will still be able to make money on the back end with digital online release   i think there will always be a niche for people who want to see a movie when it 's new on the big screen so in the long run i think the more premium cinemas like with the more premium experience with stylish contemporary theaters with comfortable seats food alcohol etc will still get people in the door   amc and will need to adapt to this model too and in some major cities already are trying amc might be having slightly more success at this so far but we 'll see   the industry will probably need to begin to operate more like a niche premium product in order to survive

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

people typically present themselves to be as wealthy as possible to banks and as poor as possible to the government at tax time   gross income is really the most reliable number for most folks your and your employer are required by law to report an accurate gross income figure annually anything else is totally situational   all they are doing anyway is computing your total debt to income ratio and mortgage to income ratio the government agencies that buy mortgages the big bank that buys the mortgage or the self underwriting bank has differing standards for different products

work under uk umbrella company   by this you are thinking of creating a new legal entity in uk then its not a very great idea there will be lot of paperwork additional taxes in uk and not much benefit   ask uk company to remit money to indian savings bank account    ask uk company to remit money to indian business bank account both are same from tax point of view opening a business bank account needs some more paper work and can be avoided   note as an independent contractor you are still liable to pay taxes in india please pay periodically and in advance and do not wait till year end you can claim some benefits as work related expenses for example a laptop mobile purchase certain other expenses and reduce from the total income the uk company is paying

i think jb king 's answer is interesting from the point of view of is this good for me but the op 's question boils down to why would a company do this the company buys back shares when it thinks it will better position the company financially a simple scenario if company a wants to open a new store for example they need to buy the land build the store stock it etc etc and this all costs money   the company can get a loan use accrued capital or raise new capital by issuing new stock   each method has benefits and drawbacks one of the drawbacks of issuing new stock is that it dilutes the existing stock 's value   previously total company profits were split between x shares   now the profits are shared between x+y shares where y is the number of new shares issued to raise the capital this normally drives the price of the stock down since the expected future dividends per stock have decreased now the company has a problem the next time they go to raise money by issuing stock they will have to issue more shares to get the same value leading to more dilution   to break out of this cycle the company can buy back shares periodically   when the company feels the the stock is sufficiently undervalued it buys some back   now the profits are shared with a smaller pool and the stock price goes up and the next time company a needs to raise capital it can issue stock so it probably has little to do with rewarding shareholders and more to do with lowering the cost of capital for the company in the future

imagine an internet where the best content was behind a pay wall while the buzzfeed gawker and even yahoo were free you can get your standard journalism plus clickbait for free but you could also support the greatest content on the web while providing it greater power by generating it revenue all by choice of course if you do n't want a premium product the best journalism and well constructed opinion pieces do n't pay for it    of course freemium such as the way the economist is currently i.e. 3 free articles a week or something like that is the best way to attract new customers but i strongly feel that the best journalism is worth more than the clickbait garbage despite that i wo n't click an irrelevant ad simple because i feel the article is better crafted this i would be willing to pay more for it even on the internet

whenever a website mentions hypothetical growth of $ 100 $ 1,000 or $ 10,000 it assumes that that investor himself will reinvest the dividend this is true whether you look at morningstar or financial times   unless the website does not have dividend data e.g. google finance   if you want to compare the account value after withdrawing dividends    since the income class pays dividends annually there will be 1 jumps per year   for example the 2013 dividend payment   and the 2014 dividend payment

are you suggesting that the banks are using marketing to convince retail customers to buy financial products that they would not normally purchase due to the products complexity   while that concerns is certainly valid i believe it can be applied all the way down to the simplest of securities e.g. stocks or even assets e.g. houses    that does not mean with should prohibit the sale of these products to retail customers

this is more of a long comment but may answer user 's situation too i have dealt with joint mortgages before in 3 states in the us   basically in all three states if one party wants to sell the home goes up for sale   this can be voluntary or it can go up via auction not a great choice in 2 of the 3 states the first person to respond to the court about the property the other party pays all legal fees   yes you read this right   in one case i had an ex who was on my mortgage she had no money invested in the house $ 0 down and still in college with no job   if she was n't on the mortgage i would n't have gotten loan old days of dumb rules when we split her lawyer was using the house as a way to extort other money from me   knowing the state 's laws i already filed a petition for the property but put it on hold with the clerk   meaning that no one else could file but if someone tried mine would no longer be on hold   my ex literally spent thousands of dollars on this attorney and they wanted to sell the house and get half the money from the house   so sale price minus loan amount divided between us   this is the law in almost every state if there is no formal contract   i was laughing because she wanted what would be maybe 50 75 k for paying no rent no money down and me paying for her college finally i broke her attorney down i did n't lawyer up but had many friends who were lawyers advising   after i told her lawyer she was n't getting anything might have said it in not a nice way her lawyer gave me her break down   to paraphrase she said we are going to file now   my assistant is in the court clerk 's office   you can tell the court whatever you want   maybe they will give you a greater percentage since you put the money down and paid for everything but you are taking that chance   but you will pay for your lawyer and you will need one   and you will pay for me the entire time   and this will be a lengthy process   you would be better served to pay my client half now her office was about 2 blocks from court   i laughed at her and simply told her to have her assistant do whatever she wanted   i then left to go to clerk 's office to take the hold off   she had beat me to the office i moved my car out of her garage   by the time i got there she was outside yelling at her assistant throwing a fit and papers were flying everywhere   we settled the next day   she got nothing other than the things she had already stolen from me   if i would n't have known about this loophole my ex would have gotten or cost me through attorney 's fees around 40 50 k for basically hiring a lawyer   my ex did n't really have any money so i am pretty sure lawyer was getting a percent moral of the story in any contract like this you always want to be the one bringing in the least amount of money   there are no laws that i know of in any country where the person with the least amount on a contract will come out worse   like i said in the us the best case scenario that i know of for joint property is that the court pays out the stakeholder all of their contributions then it splits things 50/50   this is given no formal contract that the court   do n't even get me started with hiring attorneys because i have seen the courts throw out so many property contracts it is n't even funny   one piece of advice on a contract if you do one   make it open and about percentages   party a contributes 50 k party b 10 k party a will pay this of mortgage and maintenance and will get this when home is sold   i have found the more specific things are the more loopholes for getting out of them there are goofy ass laws everywhere that make no sense   why would the person first filing get their lawyers paid for   the court systems in almost all countries can have their comical corners    you will never be able to write a contract that covers everything   if the shower handle breaks who pays for it   there is just too many one off things with a house you are in essence getting in a relationship with this person   i hear others say it is a business transaction    no   you are living with this person   there is no way to make it purely business   for you to be happy with this outcome both of you must remain somewhat friends and at the very least civil with each other    to add on to the previous point the biggest risk is this other person 's character and state of mind   they are putting in the most money so you do n't exactly have a huge money risk   you do have a time and a time cost risk   your time or the money you do have in this may be tied up in trying to get your money out or house sold   a jerk could basically say that you get nothing and make you the court system for a couple years to get a few thousand back and that is n't the worst case scenario   always know your worst case scenario   yours is this dude is in love with you   when he figures out 2 3 years later after making you feel uncomfortable the entire time that you are not in love with him he starts going nuts   so he systematically destroys your house   your house worth plummets you want out you ca n't sell the house for price of loan lenders foreclose or look to sue you you pay double rent because you ca n't live with the guy and you have to push a scooter to get to work that is just the worst case scenario   would i do this if i were 25 and had no family   yea why not if i trusted the other person and was friends with them   if it were just a co worker   that is really iffy with me     edit author said he will not be living with the person   so wording can be changed to say potentially in front of living with him in my examples

a lease payment is composed of an interest portion borrowed money and depreciation amount purchase residual the monthly payment is then monthly interest cost + monthly depreciation cost the money factor is used to estimate the amount of interest due in a single month of a lease so you can figure out the monthly payment if you are borrowing $ 100,000 then over the entire loan of repayment from a balance of $ 100,000 to a balance of $ 0 the average amount you owed was $ 50,000 1/2 of principal    you are repaying this loan monthly 1/12 of a year and percents are expressed as 1/100 6 1/2 for principal 1/12 for monthly 1/100 to convert percentage from 6 to .06   = 6 2400 is the product of 3 consecutive conversion 1/2 1/12 1/100 to convert from an interest rate to a money factor = money factor of which can be multiplied against the total amount being borrowed to know what the monthly interest would roughly equal some money factor info
