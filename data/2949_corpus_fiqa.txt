with your income so high your marginal tax rate should be pretty easy to determine   you are very likely in the 33 tax bracket married filing jointly income range of $ to $ so your wife 's additional income will effectively be taxed at 33 plus 15 for self employment taxes rounding to 50 means you need to withhold $ over the year or slightly less depending on what business expenses you can deduct you could use a similar calculation for ca state taxes you can either just add this gross additional amount to your withholdings or make an estimated tax payment every quarter   any difference will be made up when you file your 2017 taxes so long as you withhold 100 of your total tax liability from last year you should not have any underpayment penalties

littleadv is incorrect because receiving a 1099 means she will be taxed self employment tax on top of federal income taxes your employer will automatically withhold 7.65 of payroll taxes as they pay you each paycheck and then they 'll automatically pay the other half of your payroll tax an additional 7.65 to bring it to a total of 15.3 in other words because your wife is technically self employed she will owe both sides of payroll tax which is 15.3 of $ 38k = $ 5,800 on top of your federal income tax which is the only thing the w-4 is instructing them about what amount to withhold the huge advantage to a 1099 however is that she 's essentially self employed which means all of the things she needs to run her business are deductible expenses this includes her car computer home office supplies sometimes phone gas maintenance travel expenses sometimes entertainment etc which can easily bring her income down from $ 38k to lets say $ 23k reducing both her federal income tax and self employment tax to apply to $ 15k less saving lets say 50 of $ 15k = $ with federal and self employment because your income is so high she is actually supposed to pay quarterly taxes to make up for all of this the easy way to do this is each quarter plug your total salary + bonus and the tax you have paid so far check your into turbotax along with her income so far and all of her expenses this will give you how much tax you can expect to have left to owe so far this would be your first quarter when you calculate your other quarters do it the exact same way and just subtract what you 've already paid so far that year from your total tax liability

1 the risks are that you investing in financial markets and therefore should be prepared for volatility in the value of your holdings 2 you should only ever invest in financial markets with capital that you can reasonably afford to put aside and not touch for 5 10 years as an investor not a trader even then you should be prepared to write this capital off completely no one can offer you a guarantee of what will happen in the future only speculation from what has happened in the past 3 do n't invest it is simple keep your money in cash however this is not without its risks interest rates rarely keep up with inflation so the spending power of cash investments quickly diminishes in real terms over time so what to do extended your time horizon as you have mentioned to say 30 years reinvest all dividends as these have been proven to make up the bulk of long term returns and drip feed your money into these markets over time this will benefit you from what is known in as   dollar cost averaging and will negate the need for you to time the market

i 'm sorry to hear you 've made a mistake having read the contract of sale we signed i do not see any remedy to your current situation   however i 'm interested in making sure i do not take advantage of you   as such i 'll return the vehicle you can return my money plus the bank fees i paid for the cashiers check tax title and registration and i will look at buying a vehicle from another dealership    this seems to be the most fair resolution   if i were to pay for your mistake at a price i did not agree to it would not be fair to me   if you were to allow this vehicle to go to me at the price we agreed to it would n't be fair to you   if i were to return the car and begin negotiations again or find a different car in your lot it would be difficult for us to know that you were not going to make a similar mistake again at this point i consider the sale final but if you 'd prefer to have the vehicle back as is returning to us the money we gave you as well as the additional costs incurred by the sale then we will do so in order to set things right chances are good you will see them back down   perhaps they will just cut the additional payment in half and say well it 's our mistake so we will eat half the cost or similar but this is merely another way to get you to pay more money    stand firm   i appreciate the thought but i can not accept that offer when will you have payment ready so we can return the car if you are firm that the only two solutions is to keep the car or return it for a full refund plus associated costs i 'd guess they 'd rather you keep the car trust me they still made a profit but if they decide to have it returned do so and make sure they pay you in full plus other costs   bring all your receipts etc and do n't hand over the keys until you have the check in hand then go gladly to another dealership that does n't abuse its customers so badly if you do end up keeping the car do n't plan on going back to that dealership   use another dealership for warranty work and find a good mechanic for non warranty work note that this solution is n't legally required in most jurisdictions read your contract and all documentation they provided at the time of sale to be sure but it 's unlikely that you are legally required to make another payment for a vehicle after the sale is finalized   even if they have n't cashed the check the sale has already been finalized what this solution does though is put you back in the driver 's seat in negotiating   right now they are treating it as though you owe them something and thus you might feel an obligation toward them   re asserting your relationship with them as a customer rather than a debtor is very important regardless of how you proceed you are n't legally culpable and so making sure they understand you are n't will ultimately help you further dealerships operate on negotiation the primary power the customer has in the dealership is the power to walk away from a deal they 've set the situation up as though you no longer have the power to walk away   they did n't threaten with re possession because they ca n't the sale is final they presented as a one path situation you pay   period you do have many options though and they are very familiar with the walk away option   present that as your chosen option either they stick with the original deal or you walk away and they will have to look at getting another car off the lot which is often more important than making a profit for a dealership or selling a slightly used car if they 've correctly pushed the title transfer through or you if that 's your task in your state then your brief ownership will show up on and similar reports and instantly reduces the car 's worth   having the title transfer immediately back to the dealership does n't look good to future buyers so the dealership does n't want the car back   they are just trying to extract more money and probably illegally depending on the laws in your jurisdiction your position as customer and decide now that you 'll be fine if you have to return it and walk away then when you communicate that to them chances are good they 'll simply cave and let the sale stand as is

so you want to buy a car but have no money saved up that 's going to be hard i 'd suggest you get a part time job save up and buy a used car even with the minimum wage pay in the u.s. if you are in the u.s. you could save up and buy a car in less than a month this route would be the quickest way for you to get a car but it would also teach you the responsibility of having one since it appears you have never owned a car before   now the car will most definitely not be fancy or look like the cars that your peer 's parents bought but at least it will get you from point a to point b.   i 'd look on craigslist or your local neighborhood for cars that have not moved in a while or have for sale signs bring a mechanically inclined friend with you and contact the owner and explain them your situation there are nice people out there that would give you deep discounts based on the fact that you are a student trying to get by now you have to get registration and insurance there are many insurance companies that give discounts to students as well who have good and driving records if you happen to get a car for a good deal take good car of it once you graduate and further your career you can resell it for a profit   i also would not suggest you get any loans for a car given your situation

i 'm assuming that when you say convert to s corp tax treatment you 're not talking about actually changing your llc to a corporation there are two distinct pieces of the puzzle here first there 's your organizational form your state which is where the business is legally formed and recognized creates the llc or corporation s corp does n't come into play here your company is either an llc or a corporation there are a handful of other organizational types your state might have e.g. limited partnership etc none of these are immediately relevant to this discussion second there 's the tax treatment you receive by the irs if your company was created by the state as an llc note that the irs does n't recognize llcs as a distinct organizational type you elect to be taxed as an individual for single member llcs a partnership for multiple member llcs or as a corporation the former two elections are pass through there 's no additional level of taxation on corporate profits everything just passes through to the owners the latter election introduces a tax on corporate profits when you elect pass through treatment a single member llc files on schedule c a multiple member llc will prepare a form k-1 which you will include on your 1040 if your company was created by the state as a corporation not an llc you could still elect pass through taxation if your company qualifies under the rules in subchapter s i.e. an s corp states do not recognize s corp as part of the organizational process that 's just a tax distinction used by the irs and possibly your state 's tax authorities in your case if you are a single member llc and assuming there are no other reasons to organize as a corporation talking about s corp tax treatment does n't make any sense you 'll just file your schedule c in my experience it 's fairly simple note that this is based on my experience of and multiple member llcs in just two states your state may have different rules that affect state level taxation and the rules may change from year to year i 've found that hiring a good cpa to prepare the forms saves a good bit of stress and time that can be better applied to the business

first consider the basic case of what you are asking you expect to have a future obligation to pay interest and you are concerned that the rate when you pay it will be higher than the rate today in the simplest case you could theoretically hedge that risk by buying an asset which pays the market interest rate as the interest rate rises increasing your costs your return on this asset would also increase this would minimize your exposure to interest rate fluctuations there are of course two problems with this simplified solution   1 the reason you expect to pay interest is because you need want to take on debt to purchase your house to fully offset this risk by putting all your money in an asset which bears the market interest rate would effectively be the same as just buying your house in cash 2 the timing of the future outflow is a bit unique you will be locking in a rate in 5 years which will determine the payments for the 5 years after that so unless you own this interest paying asset for that whole future duration you wo n't immediately benefit you also wo n't need want to buy that asset today because the rates from today to 2022 are largely irrelevant to you you want something that directly goes against the prevailing mortgage interest rate in 2022 precisely so in your specific case you could in theory consider the following solution you could short a coupon bond likely one with a 10 year maturity date from today as interest rates rise the value of the coupon bond for it 's remaining life of 5 years which has an implied interest rate set today will drop because you will have shorted an asset dropping in value you will have a gain you could then close your short position when you buy your house in 5 years in theory your gain at that moment in time would equal the present value of the rate differential between today 's low mortgage rates and tomorrow 's high interest rates there are different ways mechanically to achieve what i mention above such as buying forward derivative contracts based on interest rates etc but all methods will have a few important caveats 1 these will not be perfect hedges against your mortgage rates unless the product directly relates to mortgage rates general interest rates will only be a proxy for mortgage rates 2 there is additional risk in taking this type of position taking a short position trading on a margin requires you to make ongoing payments to the broker in the event that your position loses money theoretically those losses would be offset by inherent gains in the future if mortgage rates stay low go lower but that offset is n't in your plan for 5 years 3 5 years may be too long of a timeline for you to accurately time the maturity of your hedge position if you end up moving in 7 years then changes in rates between 2022 might mean you lose on both your hedge position and your mortgage rates 4 taking on a position like this will tie up your capital either because you are directly buying an asset you believe will offset growing interest rates or because you are taking on a margin account for a short position preventing you from using a margin account for other investments to the extent you max out your margin limit i doubt any of these solutions will be desirable to an individual looking to mitigate interest rate risk because of the additional risks it creates but it may help you see this idea in another light

no such evidence exists because many people do beat the market and many people fail to earn market rate of return the way you achieve the former is generally to take risks that also increase the likelihood of the latter the amount of time and effort you invest may bias that result but generally risk and potential reward tend to track pretty closely since everyone else is making the same evaluations you ca n't prove a negative we ca n't prove unicorns do n't exist either we can advise you that hunting for one is probably not productive many others have been trying and if there was one we 'd probably have seen at least something that encourages us to continue looking not impossible but the evidence is far from encouraging market rate of return can be achieved fairy reliably with minimal risk and minimal effort and at mostly long term tax rates i consider that sufficient for my needs others will feel otherwise

in both cases you have a bunch of assets that pay into a trust and a set of rules determining how the payments are distributed to bond holders     typically the bonds are split up by seniority where any losses from the underlying assets gets recognized by the least senior bond holder first and the most senior is protected until those below in seniority are wiped out   in the case of mortgage backed securities you have a lot of early payoffs sales and refinances and those payoffs tend to pay off the senior bonds first though in practice quite a bit more complicated than that   cdos tend to have bonds as assets that pay into the trust and have mortgages   cdos used to be more likely to be things like corporate debt or junk rated debt   but during the housing bubble you did have cdos backed by some form of mortgage backed bonds   if you build a cdo out of tranches of you are going through multiple stages of and things get weird when you have highly correlated loss behavior in your underlying assets   the equity position or the residual as it is sometimes called is whatever money coming from the underlying assets is n't owed to any bond after all of the structuring rules are followed   this would be interest received in excess to interest owed + money required to make up for lost principal   typically goes back to the issuing bank   there is something called a bond that gets carved out of the residual and pays to the investment bank i gather   and of mortgage bonds are pretty worthless in a high loss environment like this

the question regarding your snapshot is fine but the real question is what are you doing to improve your situation   as john offered one bit of guidance suggests you have a full year 's gross earnings as a saving target in my opinion that 's on the low side and 2x should be the goal by 35   i suggest you look back and see if you can account for every dollar for the prior 6 12 months this exercise is n't for the purpose of criticizing your restaurant spending or cost of clothes but to just bring it to light often there 's some low hanging fruit in this type of budgeting exercise spending that you did n't realize was so high   i 'd also look carefully at your debt what rate is the mortgage and the student loans by understanding the loans rates terms and tax status e.g. whether any is a deduction you can best choose the way to pay it off if the rates are low enough you might consider funding your 401(k accounts a bit more and slow down the loan payments   it seems that in your 30 's you have a negative net worth but your true asset is your education and future earning potential   from a high level view you make $ taking $ 50 k off the top which after taxes gives you $ 30 k to pay your student loan you are still earning $ 130 k putting you at or near top 10 of families in this country this should be enough to afford that mortgage and still live a nice life   in the end there are three paths earn more why does hubby earn half what you do in the same field spend less or reallocate current budget by changing how you are handling that debt

yes you do have to pay taxes in the uk as well but it depends on how much you have already been taxed in the us say you have to pay 20 tax in the uk for your earnings here you are required to pay the same percentage on your foreign income as well now if your home country already taxed you at 10 for the sake of example then you only need to pay the remaining 10 in the uk however the tax law in the uk does allow you to choose between arising basis and remittance basis on your income from the country you are domiciled in what i have explained above is based on when income arises but the laws are complicated and you are almost always better off by paying it on arising basis

transferring the balance of a credit card is what they call moving your debt from one credit card to another credit card or loan   a debit card however is not debt it is a card that is tied to a checking account with money in it you ca n't transfer debt to your checking account if you have enough money in your checking account to cover the balance of your credit card you can pay it off   that is a really good thing to do because the balance on your credit card is costing you a lot in interest charges each month   were you perhaps thinking of transferring a balance from your debit card 's checking account to a new credit card where you would then have a new debt on the credit card and extra cash in your debit card 's checking account this is possible with most credit cards and is usually called a cash advance however just to caution you cash advances typically have high interest rates often you will see promotions where they will offer low or no interest rate for a short time but this is just a trick to entice you to borrow extra knowing that if you need the money now you 'll most likely still need it in 6 months when the promotion expires i do n't recommend it

part of this is the flipper economy that grew out of the last housing downturn people try to buy a house they can afford that needs some work but flippers come in buy it in cash do some renovations and suddenly the house becomes out of reach for a lot of people builders are just as bad instead of making sensibly sized affordable houses they all build 20 room   upper middle class people are buying a lot of these houses and are putting themselves in deep financial straits doing so they are mortgaged up to the eyeballs where all it takes is a medical issue a   job loss or some other hiccup in their finances to cause it all to come down   if you have money not just a good paycheck actual free cash on hand all of the above works for you but even if you have a good paycheck if you do not have significant cash reserves you really do n't have any hope of competing in this market

the situation you 're proposing is an over simplification that would n't occur in practice orders occur in a sequence over time time is an important part of the order matching process orders are not processed in parallel otherwise the problem of fairness already heavily regulated would become even more complex first crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators   crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another 's ask or a lower ask than another 's bid   a locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another   hfts would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees since these are forbidden and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur orders are up processed in order of price time priority so the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair   they would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid ask cost to the holder

first off you should phone your broker and ask them just to be 100 certain you will be exercised on the short option that was in the money it is irrelevant that your portfolio does not contain aapl stock you will simply be charged the amount it costs to purchase the shares that you owe i believe your broker would just take this money from your margin cash account they would not have let you put the position on if your account could not cover it i ca n't see how you having a long dated 2017 call matters you would still be long this call once assignment of the short call was settled

i do n't think you 're missing anything on the math side as far as the payments   likewise it may seem everyone 's driving a nicer car but i 'm going to predict that 's based on area and a few other factors for instance my used car feels like riches in a college town   the behavior of why people would pay money especially with high interest debt for something is a little different to explain the behavior behind people who purchase luxury cars for some people a car is a purchase that they value similar to a person valuing the clothes they wear the house they live in or the equipment they buy and either borrowing or paying full price on an expensive car is worth it to them   we can call it a status symbol and criticize the financial waste without realizing wait this is something they value like a rare book collector likes rare books would a rare book collector pass on borrowing money if it meant a once in a lifetime rare book purchase opportunity have you ever felt wow this is cool awesome amazing with something   basically that 's how many of them feel toward these cars   as much as i 'd love to say they 're only doing it for status because i 'm not a car person that 's actually somewhat de and the more i 've met people like this the more i 've realized this is their thing and to them it 's totally worth it even with all the debt   i have no doubt that there 's a percentage of them who truly may be misled maybe they do n't realize the full cost of borrowing money or leasing   still for those who do n't care the full cost that 's because it 's their thing   we can all agree that it 's still not wise to do financially borrow on a luxury vehicle and it wo n't change that some people will do it

using it as a way to manage their money better it ’s a question not necessarily of spending less but of learning how to spend smarter   and   a strictly financial perspective layaway looks foolish as critics point out if you were to put the purchase on a credit card instead and pay off the amount in full by the time that the layaway period would have elapsed you could well pay less in interest than the five dollar service fee that most stores charge alternatively if you do n’t have a credit card you could put the money you ’re going to spend on the product into a savings account or under your mattress that would save you the service fee and eliminate the risk that you ’ll have to pay a cancellation fee if you end up not making all the layaway payments   basically this   do not make financial sense   you are better off putting the money into a bank account   why do people have such little financial control

employee stock purchase plans were heavily neutered by u.s. tax laws a few years ago and many companies have cut them way back while discounts of 15 were common a decade ago now a company can only offer negligible discounts of 5 or less tax free and you can just as easily get that from fluctuations in the market these are the features to look for to determine if the espp is even worth the effort as for a cash value if a plan has at least one of those features and you believe the stock has real long term value you still have to determine how much of your money you can afford to divert into stock if the discount is 5 the company is paying you an extra 5 on the money you put into the plan

this is going to vary from insurer to insurer and likely year to year   typically an insurer will set what it calls the guaranteed rate of return for whole life policies and will allow you to take loans against the cash value of your policy at some adjustment to that rate   also typically you pay the interest back to yourself less some small administrative fee some insurers have whole life policies called something along the lines of an accelerated cash value policy or a high early cash value policy stick to these ones   the commission structure is less favorable to the agent broker but much more of your premium is recognized as cash value earlier the benefit for lack of a better word to taking a loan against your own cash value over taking a loan from a bank is the severely reduced process   there 's no underwriting for your loan like there would be from a bank   if you 're laid off maybe you ca n't get a loan from a bank but you can scoop some money out of your policy on a loan basis or alternatively you can just surrender the policy and take the accrued cash value many people will poo poo the value of whole life but fact of the matter is your underwriting status can change in the course of your life and it 's possible that in the future you wo n't be able to buy any life insurance   there 's nothing wrong with having something permanent to supplement your larger term policies personally i view diversification as having money in a lot of different places   this strategy is probably not as efficient as it could but i do n't like the idea of having all my eggs in one basket   i have cash in a lock box at home cash savings cds a personal loan portfolio bitcoins index funds individual stocks commodity etfs and bond funds spread in traditional 401(k roth ira and regular taxable accounts spread out to 6 different institutions   i do n't personally own any whole life but i 'll probably buy a small policy before my next 6-month birthday i might as well put some money there too   all of this is to say do not put all of your money in a whole life policy and do not buy all of your life insurance needs via whole life

you ca n't ask insurers to use a particular score they have a state approved underwriting model that they must follow consistently insurance companies make money by not paying claims and poor credit score including limit access to credit increases the probability that you will file a small claim why if you get into a minor accident say $ 750 of damage and have a $ 500 deductible you are much less likely to file a claim to get $ 250 if you have access to a cash or credit lines to make the repairs yourself   if you feel that you are going to be penalized for closing credit card accounts the solution is simple do n't close them other than an event where you need to sever a relationship with a co owner of an account ie you break up with your significant other dissolve a business etc or avoid paying an annual fee there is no advantage to you closing a revolving credit account ever if you can not control your spending throw the card in the eventually the credit card company will close your account for inactivity which affects your credit to a lesser degree the big exception is if you carry sufficient balances on other cards your credit utilization ratio goes up materially

your chief problem seems to be that you 're mixing visa credit cards and a european automated clearing house credit cards are primarily an american concept but do work worldwide especially in industry the credit card companies are financial institutions themselves and operate similar to international banks they 're typically acting as intermediaries between the customer 's bank and the retailer 's bank so this works even if those two banks have no existing agreements   this is expensive though is a cheaper european system which eliminates the middle man it allows the consumer 's bank to directly pay the retailer 's bank visa is not a member of

gt;if you 're argument held true in court no one could sue anyone successfully   that is my point   admittedly my above example is very simplistic but it was designed to simply illustrate my point   and no buying a shares of google or exxon or whatever other equity would not make you lawsuit proof otherwise all you would need to do is open a brokerage account   i wo n't go into this on post but i would be happy to type out a few real examples they involved trusts holding llc 's and even suing yourself   this whole conversation started by the article about robert kiyosaki getting sued by his partners getting a judgement against him and instead of paying his former partner he bk 's one of his companies to get out of debt   rich dad 's estimated personal net worth   $ 80 sites dad poor dad bankrupt    how many books has he sold   just the rich dad poor dad book has sold over 26 million wiki and obviously that does n't count future sales he has many books dvd 's educational material seminars etc   rich dad is also very diversified and has other business interest such as mining companies oil and gas solar venture capital wiki   the above referenced forbes article goes on to say rich dad co. ceo has informed them that kiyosaki would not be putting any of his personal fortune toward the settlement as for rich global sullivan claimed it only had a few million in its coffers   so here is a case of a legitimate lawsuit it was heard in court and rich dad was ordered to pay $ 24 million to his former   he claims he ca n't pay it and files for corp bk yet his personal net worth is over 3x that amount not to mention the net worth of his new company not to mention future sales   thanks to some financial and legal gymnastics his partners get screwed out of their share of earnings   i fail to see how this is n't an example of abusing the system   rich dad is n't even offering to pay out on future sales or even trying to negotiate a lower settlement   he just pulled out the bk card and fu his debtors will get pennies on the dollar   it seems that our perspectives on ethical business practices are at opposite ends of the spectrum   in my opinion utilization of the bk laws in this manner which effectively makes one completely exempt from liability or financial responsibility is exactly what is wrong with the states at least one reason   if you ca n't or refuse to see this or you truly think this is just good business then i do n't know what else to say other than you are part of the problem     oh and i never addressed your other point gt;first you would be breaking the law for driving without insurance    no problem i 'd pay the + ticket and keep moving while you drink your meals through a straw

you are missing a few variables from your calculation particularly implied volatility   even so it does not look like it would be too great a predictor even if incorporated   you should focus on calculating the option price at a different point in time with a different underlying price instead of using a total position value as that can be done afterwards i programmed and use the standard black scholes model to calculate expected returns    there are many tools online to help you without doing the programming or calculations yourself

the most obvious example would be a situation where a company is growth constrained but cash flow positive it may have enough cash flow to service $ 10 million of debt but it needs to build a new facility that will cost $ 20 million there is the option to raise debt and equity or just raise equity and move quicker to getting that facility up and running    there are also situations where debt is used to replace equity i.e. dividend or leveraged share redemption

this is a very good question the biggest difference is that when you put money in a savings bank you are a lender that is protected by the government and when you buy stocks you become an owner as a lender whether the bank makes or loses money on the loans it makes they still maintain your balance and pay you interest and your principal balance is guaranteed by the government in the usa the bank is the party that is primarily at risk if their business does not perform well as an owner you participate fully in the company 's gains and losses but you also put your money at risk since if the company loses money you do too because of this many people prefer to buy funds made up of many stocks so they are not at risk of one company performing very poorly or going bankrupt when you buy stock you become a part owner and share in the profitability of the company often through a dividend you should also be aware that stocks often have years where they do very poorly as well as years when they do very well however over a long period of time 10 years or more they have historically done better in outpacing inflation than any other type of investment for this reason i would recommend that you only invest in the stock market if you expect to be able to leave the money there for 10 years or more ideally and for 5 years at the very least otherwise you may need to take the money out at a bad time i would also recommend that you only invest in stocks if you already have an emergency fund and do n't have consumer debt there is n't much point in putting your money at risk to get a return if you can get a risk free return by paying off debt or if you would have to pull your money back out if your car broke down or you lost your job

my answer is n't a full one but that 's because i think the answer depends on at minimum the country your broker is in the type of order you place limit market algo etc and the size of your order for example i can tell from watching live rates on regular lot limit orders i place with my uk based broker that they hold limit orders internally until they see a crossing rate on the exchange my requested stock is trading on then they submit a limit order to that exchange   i only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after i see my limit price print and my fills are always better than my limit price whereas with my us based broker i can see my regular limit order in the order book depth of book data prior to any fills   i will routinely be notified of a fill before i see the limit price print   and my fills come from any number of us exchanges nyse arca bats etc even for the same stock i should point out that the nbbo rule in the us under sec regulation probably causes more complications in handling of market and limit orders than you 're likely to find in most countries

to calculate the balance not just principal remaining type into your favorite spreadsheet program it is important that the periods for periods and rate match up   if you use your annual rate with quarterly periods you will get a horribly wrong answer so if you invest $ 1000 today expect 6 interest per year 0.5 interest per month withdraw $ 10 at the end of each month and want to know what your investment balance will be 2 years 24 months from now you would type and you would get a result of $ or to compute it manually use the formula found here by poster    this is often taught in high school here as a application of series the derivation goes like this   using the notation   r = 1 + p = present value a = payment per term denotes the fv at end of term 1 etc   rp + a    + a + a = + ra + a    + ra + a + a = + + ra + a    + + + = p + a   that is fv = p + a    this is precisely what sic computes for the case of payments made at the end of each term payment type = 0 it 's easy enough to repeat the calculations as above for the case of payments made at the beginning of each term this wo n't work for changing interest rates or changing withdrawal amounts   for something like that it would be better for you if you do n't want online calculators to set up a table in a spreadsheet so you can adjust different periods manually

as i understand it the usual rule is that the country you are resident in taxes you on your worldwide income but gives you credit for foreign tax paid the country you are not normally resident in taxes you only on income from that one country note that residence for tax purposes can have different rules from residence for immigration purposes at least in the uk being resident in the country for more than half the tax year normally makes you tax resident and there are some other cases too i expect other countries are similar but the details of the rules and the start end of the tax years may vary i do n't know the exact rules for finland and belgium but i expect your belgian taxes will be based on your belgian income only and your finnish taxes will be based on your worldwide income but with a credit for your belgian taxes engaging accountants from both countries to confirm the exact rules and what exactly you should put on the forms is almost certainly a good idea

simply put for a mortgage interest is charged only on the balance as well think of it this way on a $ 100 k 6 loan on day one 1/2 is $ 500 and the payment is just under $ 600 so barely $ 100 goes to principal but the last payment of $ 600 is nearly all principal   by the way you are welcome to make extra principal payments along with the payment due each month an extra $ in this example paid each and every month will drop the term to just 15 years think about that 40 higher payment all attacking the principal and you cut the term by 1/2 the time

yes you can send in a 2012 1040-es form with a check to cover your tax liability however you will likely have to pay penalties for not paying tax in timely fashion as well as interest on the late payment you can have the irs figure the penalty and bill you for it or you can complete form 2210 on which these   matters are figured out yourself and file it with your form 1040 the long version of form 2210 often results in the smallest extra amount due but is considerably more time consuming to complete correctly alternatively if you or your wife have one or more paychecks coming before the end of 2012 it might be possible to file a new w-4 form with the hr department with a request to withhold additional amounts as federal income tax i say might because if the last paycheck of the year will be issued in just a few days time it might already have been sent for processing and hr might tell you it is too late but depending on the take home pay it might be possible to have the entire $ 2000 withheld as additional income tax instead of sending in a 1040-es the advantage of doing it through withholding is that you are allowed to treat the entire withholding for 2012 as satisfying the timely filing requirements so no penalty for late payment even though you had a much bigger chunk withheld in december and no interest due either   if you do use this approach remember that form w-4 applies until it is replaced with another and so   hr will continue to withhold the extra amount on your january paychecks as well   so file a new w-4 in january to get back to normal withholding fix the extra exemption too so the problem does not recur in 2013

the biggest risk you have when a country defaults on its currency is a major devaluation of the currency since the euro is a fiat currency like almost all developed nations its promise comes from the expectation that its union and system will endure the euro is a basket of countries and as such could probably handle bailing out countries or possibly letting some default on their sovereign debt without killing the euro itself a similar reality happens in the united states with some level of with state and municipal debt being considered riskier than federal debt it is n't uncommon for cities to default the biggest reason the euro will probably lose a lot of value initially is if any nation defaults there is n't a track record as to how the eu member body will respond will some countries attempt to break out of the eu if the member countries then the euro collapses rendering any and all euro notes useless it is that political stability that the value of the euro if you are seriously concerned about the risk of a falling euro and its long term stability then you 'd do best buying a hedge currency or a basket of hedge currencies to diversify risk many will recommend you buy gold or other precious metals but i think the idea is silly at best it is not only hard to buy precious metals at a fair value it is even harder to sell them at a fair value whatever currency you hold needs to be able to be used in transactions with ease does n't do you any good having $ 20 k in gold coins and no one willing to buy them as the seller at the store will usually want currency and not gold coins if you want to go the easy route you can follow the same line of reasoning central banks do buy usd and hold it it is probably the world 's safest currency to hold over a long period of time current us policy is inflationary so that wo n't help you gain value but that depends on how the eu responds to a sovereign debt crisis if one matures

most of what other ppl are suggesting can be be filed under be a good employee which it sounds like you already kind of are as a waitress which is why he asked you to interview with him   things that are maybe more specific to the finance world that can help you out would be more helpful for you a huge thing i 've seen that assistants can do that can be very helpful is to help their boss catch things they may otherwise be too busy to catch themselves if you can save your boss an hour or two and get him the information he needs to make a more informed decision yourself you will find yourself an invaluable member of the team   maybe you can suggest the following plan in the interview   see if you can figure out what types of investments they make and what they specialize in pm me if you want do n't want to share the company name here and i can maybe help you figure that part out set up google alerts for anything and everything that might be of interest to the firm maybe he invests in certain industry verticals and needs to follow all the trends in that industry very closely maybe he handles a specific customer and needs to know anything that might affect their positions in the market you wo n't really know any of these details before you get the job but asking the right questions in the interview can show that you are taking an initiative spend an hour or two in the morning before markets open preferably preparing a things to watch memo based on his meetings for the day funds companies he might be investing in or general trends that he will need to watch out for potentially this should include things like earnings calls coming up news announcements changes in important market indicators or new reports from market movers like bridgewater 's daily research library daily the goal is to make it so he does n't have to spend too much time researching these things himself but obviously if he wants to he will have to read up on it himself you should just give him the big picture thesis of what 's going on and he can take it from there talk a lot about optimization my personal goal for myself is to take everything i spend any amount of time on and automate it by one order of magnitude if something takes me 2 days to do it should only take me 2 hours if something takes me 2 hours it should only take me 2 minutes that way my work gets easier over time and lets me focus on new things that i have n't figured out yet if you talk about that in the interview i 'm sure he 'd love to have you help him make his life easier

in addition to individual stocks your entire portfolio will also have a beta   it would be equal to the weighted sum of the individual asset betas   so a beta portfolio of 1 would have approximate risk equal to a market index you would use this to construct a risk level that you were comfortable with given the expected return of the individual assets   you are also interested in obtaining a high level of alpha which means that your portfolio is earning more than what would be expected given it 's level of risk

there is economic value added to the marketplace by having many investors trading stocks the stock market itself can be thought of as a tool which provides additional liquidity to the marketplace liquidity is the ease with which you can convert your assets into cash for example how quickly could you sell your car if you needed money to pay a medical bill without a stock market funds would be very illiquid an investor would likely need to post advertisements to have other people consider buying his her shares until the match between a buyer and seller is found the person with the shares ca n't use the cash they need on the other side of the transaction are people who have an appetite for risk this means that for various reasons they are willing to take on more risk than you if it pays off on average they are young and have many years of salary earnings in front of them or they are rich can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average consider this like a transaction between your insurance broker you do n't want to pay for a new car if you get in an accident and you 're willing to pay total annual premiums that on average will cost more than that same car over time you do n't want the risk but the insurance company does that 's how they make money so by participating in any marketplace you are providing value in the form of liquidity and by allowing the market to allocate risk to those willing to take it on

you left out the part where i said cities use it as a source of revenue meaning there are two factors at play the city limiting the number of medallions drives up their auction price because there 's high demand and the cab companies trying to extract enough profit from the medallion to be worth it the city decides how many medallions to release just like in nyc they auction off permits for hot dog vendors which are ironically similarly priced imagine for a moment they gave vendor licenses to everyone who wanted to open a stand in central park you would n't even be able to see the park   i would n't really say it 's fair to call it a stranglehold more of wringing the last drop out of because you 're dying of thirst   personally i think the medallion model is bullshit in that sense i 'm all for a regulated free market where supply and demand find an equilibrium within the rules in reality you only find the medallion model in large markets which is n't really representative of the taxi industry as a whole

you need to negotiate with your broker to allow you to do more exotic order types   one in particular i recommend is a hidden aka iceberg order   you enter two numbers   the first is the number of shares for your entire order the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book this is the tip of the iceberg the remaining shares are hidden below the surface the maker taker rule applies as follows the amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity   the amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity example you want to sell 10,000 shares total   you enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed   on the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled   you receive a rebate for 1,000 shares you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares also like one of the previous posters mentioned only trade high liquidity stocks   large market cap companies with high volume   this is why day traders love tesla amazon netflix etc large market cap high volume and high volatility   easy to catch $ 10 + moves in price hope this helps happy trading

this is somewhat of a non answer but i 'm not sure you 'll ever find a satisfying answer to this question because the premises on which the question is based on are flawed   money itself does not exist physically at least not in the same sense that a product you buy does it simply does not make sense to say that you physically own money you can build a product out of but you can not build a money out of if you could then you could print your own money actually you can try to print your own money but nobody would knowingly accept it and thus is it functionally to real money the paper has no intrinsic value its value is derived from the fact that other people perceive it as valuable and nowhere else ergo paper money is no different than electronic money it is for this reason that if i were you i would be okay with online forex trading

your employer could consider procuring benefits via a third party administrator which provides benefits to and bargains collectively on behalf of multiple small companies   i used to work for a small start up that did exactly that to improve their benefits across the board including the 401k   the fees were still higher than buying a vanguard index or etf directly but much better than the 1 you 're talking about    in the meantime here 's my non professional advice from personal experience and hindsight if you 're in a low medium tax bracket and your 401k sucks you might be better off to pay the tax up front and invest in a taxable account for the flexibility assuming you 're disciplined enough that you do n't need the 401k to protect you from yourself   if you max out a crappy 401k today you might miss a better opportunity to contribute to a 401k in the future   big expenses could pop up at exactly the same time you get better investment options    side note if not enough employees participate in the 401k the principals wo n't be able to take full advantage of it themselves   i think it 's called a test to ensure that the plan benefits all employees not just the owners and management   so voting with your feet might be the best way to spark improvement with your employer   good luck

first of all since you 're 16 you will not invest in anything you can not you 're a minor you can not enter contracts and as such you can not transact in property your bank accounts are all ugma accounts i.e. your guardian or someone else who 's the trustee on the account will be the one transacting not you you can ask them to do trades but they do n't have to they must make decisions in your best interest which trades may not necessarily be if however they decide to make trades or earn interest or make any other decision that results in gains these are your gains and you will be taxed on them the way taxes work is that you 're taxed on income you 're free to do with it whatever you want but you 're taxed on it so if you realized gains by selling stocks and reinvested them you had income the gains which you did with whatever you felt like reinvested the taxman does n't care what you did with the gains the taxman cares that you had them for losses it is a bit more complicated and while you can deduct losses there are limitations on how much you can deduct and some losses can not be deducted at all when realized like wash sale losses or passive activity losses when you have stock transactions you will probably need to file a tax return reporting the transactions and your gains losses on them you may end up not paying any tax at all but since the broker is reporting the transactions you should too if only to avoid irs asking why you did n't this again should be done by your guardian since you personally can not legally sign documents you asked if your gains can affect your parents taxes not exactly your parents taxes can affect you this is called kiddie tax unofficially of course you may want read about it and take it into account when discussing your investments with your guardian parents if kiddie tax provisions apply to you your parents should probably discuss it with their tax adviser

the yield on treasury bond indicates the amount of money anyone at can make at virtually zero risk    so lets say banks have x say 100 amount of money they can either invest this in treasury bonds and get y% say 1 interest that is very safe or invest into mortgage loans i.e. lend it to people at say at 3 the extra is to cover the servicing cost and the associated risk put another way if you wanted only y% why not invest into treasury bonds rather than take the risk and hassle of getting the same y% by lending to individuals in short treasury bond rates drive the rate at which banks can invest surplus money in the market or borrow from the market this indirectly translates into the savings lending rates to the banks customers

i disagree with the selected answer there 's no one rule of thumb and certainly not simple ones like 20 cents of every dollar if you 're 35 you 've made a good start by making a budget of your expected expenses if you read the mr. money mustache titled the shockingly   simple math behind early retirement you will understand that it is usually a mistake to think of your expenses as a fixed percentage of your income in most cases it makes more sense to keep your expenses as low as possible regardless of your actual income   in the financial independence community it is a common principle that one typically needs 25 30 times one 's annual spending to have enough money to sustain oneself forever off the investment returns that those savings generate this is based on the assumption of a 7 average annual return 4 after inflation so the real answer to your question is this update brought to my attention that this formula does n't work that well when the savings rates are low 20 range this is because it assumes that money you save earns no returns for the entire period that you are saving this is obviously not true investment returns should also count toward your annual spending goal for that reason it 's probably better to refer to the blog post that i linked to in the answer above for precise calculations that 's where i got the 37 years at 20 savings rate figure from depending on how large and small x and y are you could have enough saved up to retire in 7 years at a 75 savings rate 17 years at a 50 savings rate or 37 years at the suggested 20 savings rate for olds as you go through life your expenses may increase eg starting a family starting a new business unexpected health event etc or decrease kid wins full scholarship to college so could your income however in general you should negotiate the highest salary possible if you are salaried use the 25x rule and consider your life and career goals to decide how much you want to save and stop thinking of expenses as a percentage of income

normally interest only mortgages are taken incase one planning to sell off the property after a few years and purchase of the property is for investment in such a case instead of oneself with a huge emi one opts for an interest only mortgage and towards the end of the term sell off the house at profit and repay back the entire principal   i am not to sure if interest only mortgages are encouraged for properties you plan to live in although i do not know about the ing scheme normally there is no prepayment option on interest only mortgages its bank way of earning a fixed income for the contracted period and that s the reason why the interest rates are lower than a regular mortgage if you do the math you may be paying more in total interest than on a regular mortgage

recently there has been an increase in companies charging a credit card surcharge the current law does not fix the amount so therefore company 's can set there own surcharges which means you can pay different surcharges at different places in the money magazine a couple of months ago there was an interesting article that discussed a possible cap that was going to be introduced to cut down on the fluctuations of credit card surcharges as some places are generating revenue by abusing the credit card surcharge something to keep in mind is to ensure when using a debit card you are not charged the surcharge some businesses will treat the debit card the same as a credit card

it is not a riskless transaction as you put it whenever you own shares in a company that is acquiring or being acquired you should read the details behind the deal do n't make assumptions just based on what the press has written or what the talking heads are saying there are always conditions on a deal and there 's always the possibility however remote that something could happen to it i found the details of the tender offer you 're referring to quote terms of the transaction the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including    the valid tender of sufficient shares which when added to shares    owned by men ’s and its affiliates constitute a majority of    the total number of common shares outstanding on a fully diluted    basis any shares not in the offer will be acquired in a    second step merger at the same cash price as in the tender offer financing and approvals the transaction which is expected to close by the third quarter of    2014 is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions    including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period    under the hart scott antitrust act   both men ’s and    a. bank are working with the federal trade    commission to obtain approval of the transaction as soon as possible essentially there remains a small chance that one of these subject to conditions fails and the merger is off the chance of failure is likely perceived as small because the market price is trading close to the deal price when the deal vs. market price gap is wider the market would be less sure about the deal taking place note that when you tender your shares you have not directly sold them when they are taken out of your account rather your shares are being set aside deposited elsewhere so you can no longer trade them and later should the conditions be satisfied then you will be paid for your shares the deal price but should the deal fall apart you are likely to get your shares deposited back into your account and by that time their market value may have dropped because the price had been supported by the high likelihood of the transaction being completed i speculated once on what i thought was a sure deal a large and popular canadian company that was going to be taken private in a leveraged buyout by some large institutional investors with the support of major banks then the global financial crisis happened and the banks were let off the hook by a solvency opinion read the details here and here what looked like a sure thing was n't the shares fell considerably when the deal fell apart and took about four years to get back to the deal price

gt;but facebook which claims more than 900 million members had 158 million unique visitors to its site in april according to researcher up just 5 from a year ago that compares with year over year growth rates of 89 in april 2010   so about 1 in 6 users visited facebook during a particular recent month   the other 5 of 6 of users did n't visit during that month   hmmm   sounds like a lot of relatively dead fairly inactive accounts users to   and the thing is that different than other social sites like linkedin which is in a lot of ways an online resume amp business contact database facebook pretty much needs continuous and regular use that 's the premise that their whole model especially advertising wise is built on if fb reverts to people simply using it to maintain a once or twice a year update on movements of friends i.e. it becomes the equivalent of a card list storage site then it 's potential value diminishes rather dramatically   gt;also the social network is testing ways to allow those under 13 currently prohibited to participate with parental supervision   which seems from a cynical perspective anyway to be a sign that they are potentially getting desperate to maintain the purported growth in number of users and in a certain sense they are doing what all companies with saturated markets do a futile attempt to pull future demand into the present which of course to the extent that it succeeds anyway really just moves the inevitable that much closer     edit and in addition not surprisingly it looks like principle which tends to be recursive of the roughly 20 unique visitors during the month probably the majority of them roughly 80 of the 16 engaged in minimal activity with only some 20 of it and thus somewhere round of the total user base being truly active and then again probably only 20 of that maybe at or under 1 were of the users that everyone thinks are

demand is also a rule of economics and always exists   it is the advertising marketing efforts that the assumption of economics of perfect information   it is the investors estimation of what the demand will be once consumers have perfect information of the product that creates companies spurs investment and creates jobs to carry out the plan   all of this is based on the idea that the investment of time and money will generate a return   to use a different product as an example there is always demand for food with consumer preference for say pizza   i 'm not creating jobs by sitting on my fat ass at home wanting someone else to make me a pizza and drive it to my doorstep   if there is n't a pizza place i can make myself a sandwich and no jobs are created   it was the investors who there was a hidden demand for like me wanting pizza that made the plan for building a pizza place and then investing money which was used to hire employees based on the assumption that the demand existed and my would spend money giving them a return on their investment

this answer assumes you 're asking about how to handle this issue in the usa i generally downvote questions that ask about a tax legal issue and do n't bother providing the jurisdiction in my opinion it is extremely rude seeing that you applied for an llc i think that you somehow consider it as a relevant piece of information you also attribute some importance to the ein which has nothing to do with your question i 'm going to filter out that noise as an individual sole proprietor whether under llc or not you can not use fiscal years only calendar years it does n't matter if you decide to have your llc taxed as s corp as well still calendar year only c corp can have a fiscal year and you probably do n't want to become a c corp so the year ends on december 31 and whether accrual or cash you can only deduct expenses you incurred until then also you must declare the income you got until then which in your case will be the full amount of funding again regardless of whether you decided to be cash based or accrual based so the main thing you need to do is to talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state and learn about the tax law relevant to your business and its implications on your actions there may be some ways to make it work better and there are some ways in which you can screw yourself up completely in your scenario so do get a professional advice

but how does the quantity matching happen for example if i want to buy 1000 shares at $ 100 but there is only one seller to sell 10 shares at $ 100 what happens then this depends on the type of order you 've placed if you placed a fill or kill order your order to buy or sell a certain number of shares is routed to the trading floor for immediate execution if the order can not be immediately filled it is cancelled killed automatically note that the order must be filled in its entirety partial fills are not allowed in your example your buy order would n't be filled because it could n't be matched to a sell order of the same volume this is similar to an all or none order which is an order that contains   a condition instructing the broker to fill the order completely or not at all if there is insufficient supply to meet the quantity requested by the order then it is canceled at the close of the market in this case if your order was n't matched to an order of the same volume by the time the market closes it 's cancelled if you simply placed a market limit order and in the case of the limit order part of your order was matched to another order with the right price that part of your order will be filled while the rest will remained unfilled

i personally spoke with a questrade agent about my question to make a long story short in a margin account you are automatically issued a loan when buying u.s. stock with a canadian money whereas in a registered account e.g. rrsp the amount is converted on your behalf to cover the debit balance me what happens if i open an account and i place an order for u.s. stocks    with canadian money is the amount converted at the time of transfer    how does that work agent in a margin account you are automatically issued a loan    for a currency you do not have however if you have enough buying    power it will go through the interest on the overnight balance is    calculated daily and is charged on a monthly basis we do not convert    funds automatically in a margin account because you can have a debit    cash balance agent in a registered account the canada revenue agency does not allow a debit    balance and therefore we must convert your funds on your behalf    to cover the debit balance if possible we convert automatically    overnight for a registered account agent for example if you buy u.s. equity you will need usd to buy it    and if you only have cad we will loan you usd to cover for that    transaction for example if you had only $ 100 cad and then wanted to    buy u.s. stock worth $ 100 usd then we will loan you $ 100 usd to    purchase the stock in a margin account we will not convert the funds    automatically therefore you will remain to have a $ 100 cad credit and    a $ 100 usd debit balance or a loan in your account me i see it means the longer i keep the stock the higher interest    will be agent well yes however in a registered account there will be not    be any interest since we convert your funds but in a margin account there will    be interest until the debit balance is covered or you can manually    convert your funds by contacting us

i 'm going to look just at purchase price essentially you ca n't always claim the whole of the purchase price or 95 your case in the year the accounting period of purchase but you get a percentage of the value of the car each year called writing down allowance which is a capital allowance it is similar to depreciation but based on 's own formula in fact it seems you probably can claim 95 of the purchase price because the value is less than £ 1000 the logic is a bit involved but i hope you can understand it you could also claim simplified expenses instead which is just based on a rate per mile but you ca n't claim both note by year i mean whatever your account period is this could be the normal financial year but you would probably have a better idea about this see the hmrc webpage on this for more details   the big idea is that you record the value of any assets you are claiming writing down allowance on in one of a number of pools that attract the same rate of writing down allowance so you do n't need to record the value of each asset separately they are similar to accounts in accounting so they have an opening balance and closing balance if you use an asset for personal use it needs a pool to itself call that a single asset pool so to start with look at the business cars section and look at the rates for cars section to determine the rate you can claim each one links to a further article which gives more detail if you need it your car is almost certainly in the special rate category special rate is 8 a year main rate is 18 and first year allowance is essentially 100 then you look at the work out what you can claim article that talks you through the steps i 'll go through your example you would have a pool for your car which would end the account period before you bought the vehicle at zero step 1 you then add the value of the car in the period you bought it step 2 you would reduce the value of the pool if you dispose of it in the same year step 3 because the car is worth less than £ 1,000 see the section on if you have £ 1,000 or less in your pool you would normally be able to claim the whole value of the pool the value of the car in the first accounting period and reduce the value of the pool to zero as you use the car for personal use you only claim 95 of the value but still reduce the pool to zero see the section on items you use outside your business this £ 1000 is adjusted if your accounting period lasts more or less than 12 months once the pool is down to zero that it you do n't need to think about it any more for tax purposes apart from if you are claiming other expenses or if you sell it   it gets more complicated if the car is more expensive i 'll go through an example for a car worth £ 2,000   then after step 3 on the year of purchase you would reduce the value of the pool by 8 and claim 95 of the reduction this would be a 160 reduction and = 152 claim leaving the value of 1860 in the pool you then follow the same steps for the next year start with in the pool reduce the value by 8 then claim 95 of the reduction this continues until you sell or dispose of the car step 3 or the value of the pool is 1000 or less then you claim all of it in that year selling the car or disposing of the car is discussed in the   capital allowances when you sell an asset article the basic idea is that if you have already reduced the value of the pool to zero the price you sell the car for is added you your profits for that year see if you originally claimed 100 of the item if you still have anything in the pool you reduce the value of the pool by the sale value and if it reduces to below zero to say you add that amount £ 200 in this case to your profits if the value is above zero you keep applying writing down allowances in your case that seems to just means if you sell the car in the same year you buy it you claim the difference or 95 of it as writing down allowance and if you do it later you claim the purchase price in the year of purchase and add 95 of the sale price to your profits in the year you sell it i 'm a bit unclear about starting to use it outside your business which does n't seem to apply if you use it outside the business to start with    you can claim simplified expenses for vehicles if you are a sole trader or partner but not if you claim capital allowances such as writing down allowances on them or you include a separate expense in your accounts for expenses it 's a flat rate of a mile for the first 10,000 miles and per mile after that for cars and a mile for motorcycles see the page on mileage expenses for details for any vehicle you decide to either claim capital allowances claim running costs separately or claim simplified mileage expenses and once you use the flat rates for a vehicle you must continue to do so as long as you use that vehicle for your have to stick with that decision for that vehicle   in your case it seems you can claim 95 of the purchase price in the accounting period you buy it and if you sell it you add 95 of the sale price to your profits in that accounting period it gets more complicated if you have a car worth more than £ 1000 adjusted for the length of the accounting period also if you change how you use it consult the page on selling selling an asset as you may have disposed of it you can also use simplified mileage expenses but then you ca n't claim capital allowances or claim running costs separately for that car i hope that makes sense please comment if not and i 'll try to adjust the explanation

the first thing you have to do is to decided what area in finance you want to get into for example investment banking and quant are very different jobs learning all the cfa material is useful so you might as well take the exams too while you are at it you may be able to get into financial it or some type of financial programming job that is one step closer to your goal because at least you will be at a finance company and you can network with people that are in the field   also if you want to go into the buy side like i did i recommend you invest your own money and manage your own portfolio that way you would have some intimate familiarity with some companies strategies you ca n't get this from a textbook there is something a little wrong with someone who wants to manage other people 's money when he does n't manage his own that is a tough sell   you ca n't be too picky about where you get in getting in the door is the most important i got a lot of quant interviews because i was an engineer those interviews consist of a lot of math and brain teaser type questions for fundamental analyst positions they will typically want to figure out how you think about businesses companies   you can typically steer the interview any way you want which is why i think it is important that you invest your own money if you say the largest position i hold is in xyz company you can be 99 certain that they will be asking about that investment for the next 15 minutes at least that is your opportunity to show how you can add value   most companies prefer students for entry level because why hire a guy who is already working in another field when you can get someone fresh i stood out in the interviews because i could say i put $ 50k into this position because it 's not the only way to do it but i can only provide you with my experience

got some questions related to banks and cash specifically required reserve ratio and capital requirements   the way i understand it is a bank is required to hold a percentage of money it has loaned to other people required reserve ratio   example if the is 10 i give the bank 100k because it is only required to hold 10 10k it loans 90k to my neighbour neighbour buys a car from the dealership the dealership banks the 90k   now the bank can loan 81k of the dealerships 90k the bank loans to businessman who buys land worth 81k land owner banks the 81k   so the bank received 100k from me to hold and protect loaned 90k to bob recieved 90k from dealership loaned 81k to businessman recieved 81k from land owner   = bank over time will receive another 90k from bob and 81k from business man + interest this all assumes there is 1 bank and all these people put there money in the bank not keeping cash   in my native country we have no required reserve ratio we have a capital requirement on our central bank website it states a total capital ratio of 8   a capital ratio is equity + profit money given to shareholders risk weighted assets   question how do you determine equity profit and risk weighted assets for a bank   is equity the cash the bank has profit the money from and risk weighted assets how much money the bank has in loans

they will not send a bill though there 's a chance they will eventually send an letter   you must proactively pay your taxes the simplest route is to send a check to each taxing authority with the respective full amounts due   i would n't bother calling them   you could also file amended returns with each containing the correct information   as a general rule tax advisors tend to counsel against giving bank account information to the irs for payment purposes as opposed to refund purposes both to protect the timing of payment and to make it slightly more difficult for them to seize or lien your account if you choose to send a check you can use form and ny form   please triple check your social security number matches your tax return ssn so they correctly credit you for payment   you may include an explanation of the closed account if you are feeling either fearful or but if the amount due is paid in full then neither taxing authority should really care about your error

we change it every so often to reduce fraud this is idiocy they receive regular payments they are asking the people who pay them to regularly change where their money is being sent this increases their exposure to fraud dramatically as each time the account is changed there is a risk it will be changed to an account they do not control this is a huge red flag confirm that this is authentic and if so insist that they sign an agreement accepting all liability for the risks this crazy policy causes otherwise you should refuse to go through the effort of confirming new accounts and risking typing or communication errors on a regular basis this is definitely a what were they thinking kind of thing if it 's not fake entirely this answer assumes that you were given a correct explanation that they change it regularly believing that will reduce fraud

if your intention is to purchase etfs on a regular basis like $ x per month then etfs may not make sense   you may have to pay a fixed transaction cost like you were buying a stock for each purchase   in a similar no load mutual fund there are more likely to be no transaction costs depending on how it is bought    the above paragraph is not very definitive and is really dependent upon how you would purchase either etfs or mutual funds   for example if you have a fidelity brokerage account they may let you buy certain etfs commission free   okay then either etfs make great sense   it would not make sense to buy ones that they charge $ 35 per transaction if you have regular transactions that are smallish the last two questions seem to be asking if you should buy mf or buy stocks directly   for most people the later is a losing proposition   they do not have the time or ability to buy stocks directly effectively   even if they did they may not have the capital to make enough of a difference when one considers all the cost involved   however if that kind of thing interests you perhaps you should dabble   start out small and look at the higher costs of doing so as part of the cost of doing business

you may be in a situation where buying is preferred especially because you can enter the market in a strong position with a 20 down payment   if you have the financial ability to assume the risk of owning you may be better off   i would consider two things   renting is purchasing a service you are buying the flexibility to move with minimum hassle and the landlord is assuming the risk of owning the asset property they will make money on you like any service provider buying is purchasing an asset you are buying the underlying asset and assume all the risks associated with it this is large unforeseen maintenance fees taxes depreciation etc some of these risks were passed to you as a renter but some were not   just like purchasing $ 400k in stock if you have to sell when the market is down you lose big you win if you can hold unlike a stock real estate will eat your cash in taxes and repairs unless it is rented if you are willing to be a long distance landlord this may work out understand that property management fees will eat into your rent income and being long distance will give more potential for a bad tenant to ruin your property value these and other factors e.g. vacancy rate will increase your risk of loss and should be considered some of this will be your preference since you will spend much more time dealing with buying selling property management as opposed to a more clean rental situation is this hassle worth the savings for many yes others no finally i hope this calculator can help clarify some of the financial aspects for you   good luck

good grief   ask a republican to define their terminology to avoid conflict and confusion and you get labeled a liberal   honestly the stupid labeling thing is one of the most and idiotic parts of our political discourse these day   the idea here is to remove obfuscation so we can get to the point   clarify yourself   you have declared paying government employees better than others is waste   you ’ve also declared the current government delivery system is waste   but the whole system is not waste   parse it out     you do n’t want people paid more than a business can afford right   so there is no financial loss   you do n’t want a system in place that ca n’t afford to pay for itself now or in the foreseeable future after all everyone should have a chance to recover right   but when you say there is waste in the government i have to be sure you are discussing complete value including social educational technological national military and not just budget   this is important because my arguments hinge on the non budget side whereas yours seem to focus on the financial aspects    not that these are the whole of either of our views   they are simply the focuses we have used in this discussion   so stop with the cheap and we ’ll continue   there are many wasteful aspects of the government   i agree with that    it there are many things the go does that private industry either ca n’t or wo n’t do   biggest of these is corporations will not go out of their way to protect their citizens   they will do what they are paid to do and nothing else   the postal service will probably never be closed or privatized if it were however i would love too see how the cost of delivery and the pay for delivery employees are affected   i agree the question of why government waste exists is the most important   but in order to see it clearly we must get a lay of the land   we need to review two edge cases   1 where is the most waste   why is it so extreme here   2 where is the least waste   why is this part of the government more efficient   then we can inspect the different influences in each system and explore why efficiency is n’t enforced or encouraged in so many government areas and what can be done to improve efficiency or if it is an area that the nation would do better with privatization instead

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

i will use 10 of this 20 k to pay the loan back on an annual basis agreement an annual payment of 0.8 $ 2,000 $ 250,000 is nowhere near large enough   the interest alone is going to be well over $ 10,000 and probably closer to $ 20,000 on an unsecured loan so you need to plan for at least a $ 20,000 $ 30,000 annual payment depending on the terms length and interest rate on the loan    but in general is this sustainable safe   essentially what you are doing is using leverage to increase the amount you can invest   while this is fantastic when the market rises it can go horribly wrong when the market goes down   generally it is unwise to fund a risky meaning there are large swings in return investment with a risk free meaning you 'll always make a payment loan if you want to see what could happen forecast a 20 market drop and see what you are left with obviously you 'll need to make the loan payment out of your balance since you wo n't have any gains to pull from   an average of 10 12 over a long period of time is reasonable but the variance can cause the return to be anywhere from to + 40 in one year   can you afford those losses    here 's an actual example if you were to invest $ 250,000 in the s&p 500 in january 2000 with an 8 interest only loan your next three years returns would be after three years assuming an interest only payment of $ 20,000 your balance would be just over $ 100,000 you 'd still owe $ 250,000 and you 'd still be making $ 20,000 in interest payments   if your loan interest rate was 25 which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan you 'd be bankrupt after 3 years you 'd still owe $ 250 k but could not make the interest payment no this is not a good idea   the only time you should borrow money to invest in when you have control over the returns   so if you wanted to start your own business had a stable business plan and had much more certainty over the returns the borrowing money might be plausible    but borrowing money to do passive investment is a huge mistake

i 'd say that it can not be meaningfully calculated or measured because the two are just too different in every way poker stock trading i guess the last point that someone relying on luck is in poker but not in stock trading could be interpreted as stock trading being based more on luck while the second and third points indicated that poker has more true randomness and is thus based more on luck something both have in common is that people who have been losing money are often tempted to take stupid risks which lose them everything

this analysis misses the opportunities the roth ira presents to those with special access it assumes that all money grows at the same rate with investments at regular intervals these assumptions hold for normal workers but not for the privileged   suppose for example that in a single year you have limited access to a security that is an acorn you know will grow into a mighty oak for this example this security will grow 1000x over some short period of time for simplicity assume both the value of acorns you can buy and the the maximum ira contribution in this year is $ 5k.   after the short acorn growth period the after tax values are there is a minor difference in the amount of money you need to buy the acorns pre v. post tax but this is negligible relative to the amount of cash you can assume you have on hand to have special access   the atlantic provides an acorn example from private equity not used with a roth and this washington post article describes someone with non publicly traded startup stocks and a roth

i ca n't speak for canada but in the us banks and other financial industry firms will lobby the sec to some extent over proposed regulations basically any time the sec proposes a regulation they have a period where anyone including financial firms can comment on it via letters the purpose here is for the regulators to get different perspectives on the regulation to help them shape rules that go far enough to protect investors but do n't go so far as to over burden or harm the industries they 're regulating    now obviously this can be a problem largely because financial firms of course are always going to be opposed to new extensive regulations but also because more often than not few investors members of the public actually comment so the sec gets a lot more comments from the industry the sec frequently treats the volume of comments almost like votes so in return the massive volume of industry comments tends to shape their proposed regulations towards being more industry friendly you can see this in action as a huge majority of revisions to proposed regulation is use to water down the proposed rules    all in all industry members lobbying and working with their regulators is n't inherently bad after all these are the people firms that know the industry best and so their feedback is valuable and can truly help regulators to make more efficient and effective rules but it certainly can be excessive and will undoubtedly cause bad optics

the short answer to your initial question is yes the option does n't expire until the close of the market on the day of expiration because the option is expiring so soon the time value of the option is quite small   that is why the option once it is in the money will track so closely to the underlying stock price if someone buys an in the money option on the day of expiration they are likely still expecting the price to go up before they sell it or exercise it many brokers will exercise your in the money options sometime after 3 pm on the day of expiration   if this is not what you desire you should communicate that with them prior to that day

it appears that there 's a confusion between the different types of average saying the average investor generally means the most common type of small scale unsophisticated investor the mode or possibly median investor however while this class of investors is numerous each of them has assets that are quite small compared to some other types of investors and the market average performance is determined proportionally to the amount of assets held not to the number of holders so the performance of large investors counts that much more for any measure the mode of performance can be and often is different from the mean performance in this case dalbar is saying that the most common results are lower than the weighed average results

it 's a statement that seems to be true about our tendency to believe we wo n't make the same mistake twice even though we do and that somehow what 's occurring in the present is completely different even when the underlying fundamentals of the situation may be nearly identical   it 's a form of self delusion and sometimes mass delusion and it has been a major contributing factor to many of our worst financial disasters if you look at every housing bubble for instance we examine the aftermath put new regulations and procedures into place theoretically to prevent it from happening again and then move forward   when the cycle starts to repeat itself we ignore the signals telling ourselves oh that ca n't happen again this time it 's different when investors begin to ignore the warning signs because they think the current situation is somehow totally different and therefore there will be a different outcome than the last disaster that 's when things actually do go bad the 2008 housing crisis was caused by the same essential forces that brought about similar albeit smaller scale housing disasters in the 80 's and 90 's greed caused banks and other participants in the housing sector to make loans they knew were no good an oversimplification to be sure but apt nonetheless and eventually the roof in on the market   in 2008 the essential dynamics were the same but everyone had convinced themselves that the markets were more sophisticated and could never allow things like that to happen again   so everyone told themselves this was different and they dove into the markets ignoring all of the warning signs along the way that clearly told the story of what was coming had anyone bothered to notice

it is a discussion historically yes a minimum wage job was able to support a family    do you feel that only the wealthy should be able to afford to have children with the ever widening income gap and dwindling middle class please explain how this is not a possible reality   since you do not adhere to the classical definition of what minimum wage should provide what do you think minimum wage should be able to provide and individual to live independently free of assistance at 40hrs a week do you feel they should have to work over time simply to afford to exist should a minimum wage worker have to depend on government assistance to get by with or without overtime   do you feel so low of your fellow human being that you 'd rather see them starve than increase to a living wage

note that the quote distinguishes between all families and families with some savings this just means there are so many families with less than 5k that they equal all those with savings above 5k that might be because they are young and have n't started yet or because it is just not a priority for them compared to food and rent nothing about the quote suggests that anyone believes once you 've saved 5k you 're done in fact since they show savings vs age you can immediately see many people still have decades to save more they may have 5k or less now but they 're not retiring now how do you survive if you get to 65 and have nothing saved there is some government money social security and many people sell their houses or get a reverse mortgage having equity in a house is not the same as having savings and some older people live very frugally they stop buying clothes they stop their houses while others live in flat out poverty but you ca n't tell if that is their future from the fact they only had 5k saved when they were 32

there are two possible scenarios relating to slightly different definitions of pension the most normal definition of pension is that you are paid a defined amount each week or month by some company or the government if so that is not part of the estate you wo n't be able to take it as a lump sum probably it is n't affected by whatever your husband wrote in his will if on the other hand you and your husband had a big sum of money which you were drawing on to pay your expenses and still are then the big sum of money would have been part of the estate the right person to ask about this is the lawyer who dealt with your husband 's will none of this is any help in deciding what you should do with the pension

# 444568
there are some great answers on this site similar to what you asked with either a non or a us centric focus i would read those answers as well to give yourself more points of view on early investing there are a few differences between canada and the us from an investing perspective that you should also then consider namely tax rules healthcare and education i 'll get healthcare and education out of the way quickly just note the difference in perspective in canada of having government healthcare putting money into health savings plans or focusing on insurance as a workplace benefit is not a key motivating factor but more a nice to have for education it is more common in canada for a student to either pay for school while working summer part time jobs or at least taking on manageable levels of debt because it is typically not quite as expensive as private colleges in the us there is still somewhat of a culture of saving for your child 's education here but it is not as much of a necessity as it may be in the us from an investing perspective i will quickly note some common though not universal general advice before getting canadian specific i have blatantly stolen the meat of this section from ben miller 's great answer here oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing once you have a solid financial footing some of canadian investing are below for all the tax specific plans i 'm about to mention note that the banks do a very good job here of tricking you into believing they are complex and that you need your hand to be held i have gotten some criminally bad tax advice from banking reps so at the risk of sounding i recommend that you learn everything you can beforehand and only go into your bank when you already know the right answer the account types themselves just involve a few pages of paperwork to open and the banks will often do that for free they make up their fees in offering investment types that earn them management fees once the accounts are created be sure to separate the investments stocks vs bonds etc vs the investment vehicles canada has tax free savings accounts where you can contribute a certain amount of money every year and invest in just about anything you want from bonds to stocks to mutual funds any income you earn in this account is completely tax free you can withdraw these investments any time you want but you ca n't re contribute until january 1st of next year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in a tfsa and they grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k in july no tax is involved on january 1st next year you can re contribute a new $ 6 k and also any additional amounts added to your total limit annually tfsa 's are good for short term liquid investments if you do n't know for sure when you 'll need the money putting it in a tfsa saves you some tax but does n't commit you to any specific plan of action registered retirement savings plans allow you to contribute money based on your employment income accrued over your lifetime in canada the contributions are deducted from your taxable income in the year you make them when you withdraw money from your rrsp the amount you withdraw gets added as additional income in that year ie you invest $ 5k today in stocks held in an rrsp and get a $ 5k deduction from your taxable income this year the investments grow to $ 6k you withdraw $ 6k next year your taxable income increases by $ 6k note that if the investments were held normally outside of an rrsp you would have a taxable gain of only 50 of the total gain but withdrawing the amount from your rrsp makes the gain 100 taxable on january 1st next year you cannot this amount once withdrawn it can not be except for below items rrsp 's are good for long term investing for retirement there are a few factors at play here 1 you get an immediate tax deduction thus increasing the original size of investment by deferring tax to the withdrawal date 2 your investments compound tax free you only pay tax at the end when you withdraw not annually on earnings and 3 many people expect that they will have a lower tax rate when they retire than they do today some warnings about rrsp 's 1 they are less liquid than tfsa 's you ca n't put money in take it out and put it in again in general when you take it out it 's out and therefore useless unless you leave it in for a long time 2 income gets re characterized to be fully taxable no dividend tax credits no reduced capital gains tax rate and 3 there is no guarantee that your tax rate on retirement will be less than today if you contribute only when your tax rate is in the top bracket then this is a good bet but even still in 30 years tax rates might rise by 20 who knows meaning you could end up paying more tax on the back end than you saved in the short term home buyer plan rrsp withdrawals my single favourite piece of advice for young canadians is this if you contribute to an rrsp at least 3 months before you make a down payment on your first house you can withdraw up to $ 25k from your rrsp without paying tax to use for the down payment then over the next ~10 years you need to money back to your rrsp and you will ultimately be taxed when you finally take the money out at retirement this means that contributing up to 25k to an rrsp can multiply your savings available for a down payment by the amount of your tax rate so if you make you 'll save on your 25k deposited turning your down payment into $ getting immediate access to the tax savings while also having access to the cash for a downpayment makes the home buyer plan a solid way to make the most out of your rrsp as long as one of your near term goals is to own your own home registered pension plans are even less liquid than rrsps tax wise they basically work the same you get a deduction in the year you contribute and are taxed when you withdraw the big difference is that there are rules on when you are allowed to withdraw only in retirement barring specific circumstances typically your employer 's matching program if you have one will be inside of an note that 's and rrsp 's reduce your taxes on your employment immediately if you contribute through a work program that means you get the tax savings during the year instead of all at once a year later on april 30th note that i have attempted at all times to keep my advice current with applicable tax legislation but i do not guarantee accuracy research these things yourself because i may have missed something relevant to your situation i may be just plain wrong and tax law may have changed since i wrote this to when you read it

the assumption that house value appreciates 5 per year is unrealistic over the very long term real house prices has stayed approximately constant a house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house unless the individual house is maintained well one house is an extremely poorly diversified investment what if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem you can lose your investment almost overnight in contrast to this it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well diversified stock portfolio although it can happen on an individual stock thus if non leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8 over the long term i would demand higher return say 10 from a non leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks if you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio so i would demand a nominal return of 6 over the long term from such a diversified portfolio to decide if it 's better to buy a house or to live in rental property you need to gather all of the costs of both options including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere the real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate which they wo n't do more than inflation over a very long term for my case i live in finland in a special case of near rental property where you pay 15 of the building cost when moving in and get the 15 payment back when moving out and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent the property is subsidized by government provided loans i have calculated that for my case living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market priced house but your situation may be different

the big problem with your argument is the 10 per year figure because in the long term especially if adjusted for inflation the prices have not been going up nearly that fast here is a site with some nice graphs for prices over the last 40 years and it 's pretty clear to see that pretty much just what you were talking about happened prices outpaced the ability of people to pay which progressively locked out more and more first time buyers and eventually that breaks the cycle pops the bubble and the prices adjust there is always of course the choice to not buy a house and just rent or if you had the feeling that you are near the top of a bubble sell and go back to renting   it 's interesting to note that in general rental rates did not increase at nearly the same pace as the prices in the recent bubble which of course made it harder for anyone who bought investment properties in the recent 8 years or so to cover their payments via rental revenue

i know an answer has been accepted but you need an emergency fund ideally enough to cover at least 3 months of after tax basic living expenses as a free 6 months would be even better this is n't a fun way to tie up your money but it is a prudent way what if you lose your job or decide you want to change your line of work what if you 're told a close family member has only months to live and you want to take significant time off unpaid what if your car breaks down and you need a new one what if your freelance business hits a dry patch for a few months what if you want to move but ca n't sell your next house quickly i 've known people who had these types of situations come up unexpectedly some were financially prepared and had the freedom to make the choices they wanted to make others did n't and now have regrets once you have a basic emergency fund in place then go for investing with the rest of the money best of luck

in the case of bank failures you are protected by fdic insurance   at the time i wrote this you are insured up to $ 250,000   in my lifetime it has been as high as $ 1,000,000 and as low as $ 100,000   i attached a link which is updated by fdic in the case of fraud it depends if you read this story and are horrified i was too you know that the banking system is not as safe as the other answers imply in february 2005 joe lopez a businessman from florida filed a suit    against bank of america after unknown hackers stole $ 90,000 from his    bank of america account the money had been transferred to an investigation showed that mr. lopez ’s computer was infected with a    malicious program backdoor which records every    and sends this information to malicious users via the internet this    is how the hackers got hold of joe lopez ’s user name and password    since mr. lopez often used the internet to manage his bank of america    account however the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff saying that    mr. lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his    bank account on the internet a signature for the malicious code that    was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product    databases back in 2003 ouch    but let 's think about the story for a second he had his money stolen because of online banking and he did n't have the latest antivirus software   how safe is banking if you do n't do online banking   in the case of this story it would have prevented but you 're still susceptible to someone stealing your card or account information   so in the bank 's defense how does a bank not know that someone did n't wire money to a friend which is a loss for good then get some of that money back from his friend while also getting money back from the bank which had to face the loss   yes it sucks but it 's not total madness as for disputing charges from personal experience it also depends   i do n't use cards whatsoever so i 've never had to worry but both of my parents have experienced banking fraud where a fake charge on their card was not reversed   neither of my parents are rich and ca n't afford lawyers so crying lawsuit is not an option for everyone   how often does this occur   i suspect it 's rare that banks do n't reverse the charges in fraudulent cases though you will still lose time for filing and possibly filling out paperwork   the way to prevent this as much as i hate to be the bearer of bad news there is no absolutely safe place to keep your money   even if you bought metals and buried them in the ground a with a metal detector might run across it one day   you can take steps to protect yourself but there is no absolute guarantee that these will work out account closures i added this today because i saw this question and have only seen heard about this three times   provided that you get the cashier 's check back safely you should be okay but why was this person 's account closed and look at how much funds he had   from his question in the two years i banked with boa i never had an overdraft or any    negative marks on my account so the only thing that would stick out    was a check that i deposited for $ that my mom left me after she    passed naturally people are n't going to like some of my answers especially this but imagine you 're in an immediate need for cash and you experience this issue   what can you do   let 's say that rent is on the line and it 's $ 25 for every day that you 're late   other steps to protect yourself some banks allow you to use a keyword or phrase   if you 're careful with how you do this and are clever it will reduce the risk that someone steals your money

this is a wonderful comprehensive answer as it relates to transferring goods and evaluating profitability i would like to add to your post and comment about a few other costs that are transferred   first though i disagree with your comment about transfer pricing being about opportunity cost i think transfer pricing is first and primarily about the matching principal properly matching expenses incurred to the revenues generated from those expenditures or in the case of period expenses to those entities that received a benefit in the proper period i do n't work in tax so i 'm by no means an expert in this subject but i am a cpa and i feel i have a solid understanding of the subject   some additional items going through tp might be interest shared corporate services the amortization of intellectual property technology fees and depreciation charges this is not a comprehensive list and please do n't take it as such    none of these need apply to every company and certain industries and even individual companies will have exceptions for example for various reasons a multi national conglomerate may choose to maintain separate treasury functions for it 's vastly different businesses so you may not see much interest tp    interest is pretty straight forward and is the interest a company is paying on a debt not all interest is transferable but a classic example might be borrowed funds used for an acquisition the interest cost associated with that should be transferred in part back to the original entity short term borrowing costs used for operating capital is another classic example    shared corporate services are centralized functions like a legal department accounting department executive offices and the like this can also be an it department or in the instance of an international website maybe google an operations team monitoring the server loads and up times   ip could just be patents that have definite lives that a number of businesses are benefiting from ip is a bit of a mess to get into for various reasons and i 'm trying to stay focused in this post some reasons for complexity include the valuation life of the asset benefit of use is the entity even really using it etc i would imagine this is where companies get away with a lot    technology fees can be software licenses windows ai n't free   depreciation can be capitalized proprietary software   i 'm running out of gas and wanted to comment about op 's question    i do n't think sla 's and internal billing services are a matter of directly increasing efficiency more a matter of not creating inefficiencies going anecdotal anywhere i 've worked the best person to do the job has been whoever 's closest to the work it would n't make much sense to me   to have accounting gather up internal support during the very time sensitive month end close for something like one division 's trade magazine that another division placed an ad in on the other hand i think the allocation of copy expenses on an activity basis is an absolute waste of time it all depends on the specific transaction in question   great post do n't mean to detract just looking to help others understand

one factor you may be missing is that even if you pay your balance in full each month the utilization probably wo n't be zero since the reporting period is n't usually lined up perfectly with the due date on your payment   in short your utilization is not the same thing as how much balance you carry over   my advice would be do n't try carry a balance just to get a minuscule benefit on your credit score if there is one at all it is certainly not worth the interest charges you will pay to do so i think the advice you quoted is a explanation of something that can benefit your credit specifically do n't let your cards go unused for long periods of time which would make your utilization show as zero at least a few times a year you should actually use those cards even just a small amount to make the accounts show that you are utilizing your credit

these kinds of questions can be rather tricky i 've struggled with this sort of thing in the past when i had income from a hobby and i wanted to ensure that it was indeed hobby income and i did n't need to call it self employment here are a few resources from the irs there 's a lot of overlap among these resources of course here 's the relevant portion of publication 535 which i think is reasonable guidance on how the irs looks at things in determining whether you are carrying on an activity for profit several factors are taken into account no one factor alone is decisive among the factors to consider are whether most of the guidance looks to be centered around what one would need to do to convince the irs that an activity actually is a business because then one can deduct the business expenses even if that brings the total business income negative and i 'm guessing that 's a fraud problem the irs needs to deal with more often there 's not nearly as much about how to convince the irs that an activity is n't a business and thus can be thrown into other income instead of needing to pay self employment tax presumably the same principles should apply going either way though if after reading through the information they provide you decide in good faith that your activity is really just other income and not a business you 're in on the side i would find it likely that the irs would agree with you if they ever questioned you on it and you provided your reasoning assuming your reasoning is reasonable though it 's always possible that reasonable people could end up disagreeing on some things even given the same set of facts just keep good records about what you did and why and do n't get too panicked about it once you 've done your due diligence just file based on all the information you know

in addition to the excellent answers here i might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence   lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the s&p 500    if you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash   lets say 98 of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the s&p 500   you will will miss matching the s&p 500 because you have 2 not invested in some money market account    if you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track   i am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that i know these etfs are used for the difference over time that compounding effects have on leveraged funds is called beta slippage there are many fine articles explaining it at you can find one located at this link

if you think you can pay off the entire amount you borrowed over the next 12 month then you 're getting an unsecured loan at around 4 apr assuming you 're borrowing for the whole year    that 's pretty good compared to what you can typically get at the credit union   however if you only need the money for say 3 months that 4 fee effectively becomes a 16 apr and the real trouble comes when you do n't pay it off by the end of the 12 month and the standard rate kicks in if you do use the convenience check be sure to put in your calendars a reminder that the balance is due set the reminder about a month before the last billing cycle of your 0 period make sure you also have sufficient cash flow and an automated payment setup to make sure you always pay at least the minimum due on time   depending on your banking history you might be able to get away with one missed payment but more likely you 'll be penalized as soon as you miss a payment by a penny or a day and the 0 loan suddenly becomes very expensive read all the fine print make sure you understand them and set up a system to make sure you can play to the rules of the game

why do they have to endorse every check every time they want to    deposit it they told you why they said it was because it was made out to one person and there were    others on the account that could withdraw money from the acct so    endorsing it acknowledged that the payee still wanted to deposit the    money knowing others could take the $ out the reason they insist on it may have something to do with their responsibility in case of abuse they are worried that you may be using your parents money without their knowledge and if it ends up being true and they did n't enforce the requirement they may also be liable i have a joint account with my spouse and they do not let us deposit checks written to both of us unless we both endorse this is similar and stems from the same concern so here 's the unusual situation in case of a death of a joint account holder the whole account is frozen until the estate is executed you can not deposit a check of a deceased person to such an account

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

a few points yes as a rule it is better to pay down high interest accounts first as this will yield lower cost in the long run credit card balance transfers usually come at a cost typically something like 3 or $ 50 whichever is higher   so instead of transferring the debt maybe try purchasing items with your card instead of cash and using the cash to pay down the debt   this has the added benefit of giving you points or cash back on the card typically you wo n't get these for a balance transfer caveat only do this if you are very disciplined   it is very easy to run up high cc balances and forget to save the cash you should leave a bit of unused credit line on your credit cards in case of emergencies   i 'm you can use your high interest loans in the same way

the conclusion that it 's bad to have 0 utilization from the data you linked is misleading   when people have zero history they also have zero utilization   the fact that generally people with zero utilization are credit is what drives that average score   obviously people with zero or limited history will have significantly lower credit scores than folks with some utilization and a lot of history in response to the couple comments regarding the dip on attaining 0 utilization   the data shows a 67 point drop in average score from 0 to   the stark deviation in average score between those two groups is not the result of a couple point change because of zero utilization

if you have multiple accounts you have to empty them all before you can deduct any losses your loss is not a capital loss its a deduction it is calculated based on the total amount you have withdrawn from all your roth ira 's minus the total basis it will be subject to the 2 agi i.e. if your agi is > 100 k none of it is deductible and you have to itemize to get it bottom line think twice summarizing the discussion in comments if you have a very low agi i would guess that your tax liability is pretty low as well even if you deduct the whole $ 2 k and all of it is above the other deductions you have which in turn is above the standard deduction of almost $ 6 k you save say $ 300 if you 're in 15 tax bracket that 's the most savings you have however i 'm assuming something here i 'm assuming that you 're itemizing your deductions already and they 're above the standard deduction this is very unlikely with such a low income you do n't have state taxes to deduct you probably do n't spend a lot to deduct sales taxes and i would argue that with the low agi you probably do n't own property and if you do you do n't have a mortgage with a significant interest on it you can be in 15 bracket with agi between roughly $ 8 k and $ 35 k i.e. you can not deduct between $ 160 and $ 750 of the $ 2 k so it 's already less than the maximum $ 300 if your agi is $ 8 k the deduction does n't matter might cover all of your taxes anyway if your agi is $ 30 k you can deduct only $ 1400 so if you 're in the 15 bracket you saved $ 210 that again assuming it 's above your other deductions which in turn are already above the standard deduction highly unlikely as i said in the comments i do not think you can realistically save on taxes because of this loss in such a manner

short answer is yes all the firms are required to keep enough resources on hand to pay claims that may arise from even extreme events like the recent hurricanes   insurance firms are rated based on their claims paying ability and it is absolutely critical for them to maintain enough cushion to pay claims   if lose confidence they wo n't be able to write any more business and they are done   in addition to manage tail risks primary insurers like allstate will often purchase reinsurance   so for example allstate might go to swiss re and buy a policy that kicks in once allstate 's liability exceeds $ for a given event

i would be realistic and recognize that however you invest this money it is unlikely to be a life changing sum it is not going to provide an income which significantly affects your monthly budget nor is it going to grow to some large amount which will allow you to live rent free or similar therefore my advice is quite different to every other answer so far if i was you i would i reckon this might get you through half the money take the other $ 25,000 and go travelling plan a trip to europe south america asia or australia ask your job for 3 or 6 months off and quit it they wo n't give it you find a few places which you would really like to visit and schedule around them a lot of time to go where you want book your flights in advance or book one way and put aside enough money for the return when you know where you 'll be coming back from stay in a tent or cheap airbnb. make sure you have a chance to meet other people especially other people who are travelling around figure out in advance how much it will cost you a day to live basically and budget for a few beers restaurants cinema concert tickets drugs whatever you do to have fun   it 's really easy nowadays to go all sorts of places and be very about what you want to do next you will find that everywhere in the world is different all people have something unusual about them and everywhere is interesting you will meet some great people and probably become both more independent and better at making friends with strangers your friends in other countries could stay friends for life the first time you see rome the great barrier the panama canal or the tokyo fish market will be with you forever you have plenty of years to fill up your 401k. you wo n't have the energy and of a 23 year old forever go for it

this is basically what financial advisers have been saying for years that you should invest in higher risk securities when you are young and lower risk securities when you get older however despite the fact that this is taken as truth by so many financial professionals financial economists have been unable to formulate a coherent theory that supports it   by changing the preferences of their theoretical investors they can get solutions like putting all your investments in a super safe asset until you get to a minimum survival level for retirement and then investing aggressively and many other solutions   but for none of the typically assumed preferences does investing aggressively when young and becoming more conservative as you near retirement seem to be the solution   i 'm not saying there can be no such preferences but the difficulty in finding them makes me think maybe this idea is not actually correct couple of problems with your intuition that you should think about it 's not clear that things average out over time   if you lose a bunch of money in some asset there 's no reason to think that by holding that asset for a while you will make back what you lost prices are not cyclical   moreover does n't your intuition implicitly suggest that you should transition out of risky securities as you get older perhaps after having lost money you can invest in safe assets or even better the portfolio from your graph and then lever up if you do want higher risk return   you do n't need to change your allocation to risky assets and it is suboptimal to do so you want to move along the cal not the curve the riskiness of your portfolio should generally coincide negatively with your risk aversion   when you are older and more certain about your life expectancy and your assets are you exposed to more or less risks   in many cases less risks   this means you would choose a more risky portfolio because you are more sure you will have enough to live on until death even if your portfolio takes a dive your actual portfolio consists both of your investments and your human capital the present value of your time and skills   when you are young the value of this capital changes significantly with market performance so you already have background risk   buying risky securities adds to that risk   when you are old your human capital is worth little so your overall portfolio becomes less risky   you might want to compensate by increasing the risk of your investments edit note that this point may depend on how risky your human capital is how likely it is that your wage or job prospects will change with the economy overall the answer to your question is not definitively known but there is theoretical evidence that investing in risky securities when young is n't optimal having said that most people do seem to invest in riskier securities when young and safer when they are older i suspect this is because with life experience people become less optimistic as they get older not because it is optimal to do so   but i ca n't be sure

why would people sell below the current price and not within the range of the bid ask there are many scenarios where this is deliberate but all of them boil down to the fact that the top level 's bid does n't support the quantity you 're trying to sell or is otherwise one scenario as an example you 're day trading both sides but at the end of the day you accumulated a rather substantial long position in a stock   you do n't want to or are n't allowed be exposed overnight however   what do you do you place an order that is highly likely to go through altogether   there 's several ways to achieve that but a very simple one is to look at the minimum bid level for which the bid side is willing to take all of your shares then place a limit order for the total quantity at that price   if your position does n't fit into the top level bid that price will well be lower than the current bid footnotes 1 keyword quote stuffing 2 keyword overnight margin aka margin as opposed to intraday margin this is highly broker dependent exchanges do n't usually distinguish between intraday and overnight margins instead they use the collective term maintenance margin

when you send money with western union it is essentially a cash transaction   you supply western union with the name of the recipient and a location   your recipient then shows up at a western union office shows some identification and receives cash   at this point the transaction is over   it is impossible to retract it at this point because western union has already handed out cash and they have no way of contacting the recipient any longer this is the reason why you might want to legitimately use western union   it is an instant way to send cash to anyone anywhere in the world   let 's say that your best friend is stuck in a foreign land and desperately needs money   you can give him cash just as fast as each of you can get to a western union office and you do n't even need a local bank account to do so unfortunately however the nature of the service also makes it useful for scammers   you should never use this service to pay for something from someone you do n't know because there are absolutely no safeguards as mentioned by in the comments you can indeed cancel a western union money transfer if you do so before the money is picked up by the recipient   but after they pick it up the cash is gone

you missed the catch there is always a catch and in this case it is not well publicized    first some background congress both parties in 98 passed graham leach bliley it allowed commercial banks to invest securitize and insure securities it also had privacy provisions which prevented a of a mortgage from providing any personal information about the mortgage that means that as chase wrote these mortgage backed securities they were forbidden by law from telling the potential purchasers the addresses of the houses or ss 's of the purchasers    of course chase did not choose to insure these mbs 's themselves instead they chose a third party like aig because aig could not know personal information about the mortgages and was thus blinded to risk aig chose a middle of the road risk rating something like 2 risk of default    chase fraudulently represented the quality of the mortgages to the people writing the credit default swaps to insure them and to the potential buyers chase knew the mortgages were crap    fraud is fraud and is illegal in security sales even after graham leach bliley however to be clear in this case there does not need to be any faking of paperwork the loans can be passed along blindly with insurance as they were if it could be documented that chase misrepresented the quality of these aaa mbs 's they would be on the hook but the catch is that graham leach bliley offered them a cop out   aig were the real dummies in all this who writes insurance without having a good idea of the risk

first add the inflation then minus your expenses for the year if you are better than that you have done good   for example   have $ 10,000 in 2014 2 you need $ 1,000 for your expenses in 2014 so you are left with $ 9000 3 assuming the inflation rate is at 3 percent the $ 10,000 that you initially had is worth $ 10,300 in 2015 4 now if you can get anything over 10,300 with the $ 9,000 that you have you are in a better position than you were last year i.e so anything over percent is good depending on where you live living costs and inflation may vary so please do the calculation accordingly since this is just an example cheers

people have had a taste of affordable health care it will not go away but people will demand that their tax dollars are used sensibly for health coverage for all maybe the government could start working for the common people the majority of it 's citizens instead of being a slave to corporate power and the wealthy

it 's because of poor dieting and lack of exercise that they became fat in the first place somehow i doubt the best efforts are truly that serious if most of the dieting include some supplement or other    ultimately it 's just people being lazy instead of eating processed garbage with tons of eat real natural foods instead of sitting on your ass watching tv or playing video games go out for a run a bike ride or even work out in a gym   no excuse

there is a tax advantage only for medical expenses exceeding 10 of your adjusted gross income 7.5 if over age 65   this limit means only a very few people can take advantage of the deduction the expenses would be entered on schedule a itemized deductions of form 1040 you do n't have to send in the supporting documentation but you have to keep it in your records to present if audited yes a copay qualifies as an expense but needs supporting documentation
