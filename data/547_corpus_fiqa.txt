question which you need to ask yourself how well are your friends paid for their work what would happen if you just took your money and bought a garage and hired two car mechanics how would that be different from what you are doing   the money that you put into the company is that paid in capital or is it a loan to the company that will be repaid

there is no universal answer here it depends on how much risk each person is taking how you want to define the value of the business now and in the future how much each person 's contribution is essential to creating and sustaining the business how hard it would be to get those resources elsewhere and what they would cost what is fair is whatever you folks agree is fair just make sure to get it nailed down in writing and signed by all the parties so you do n't risk someone changing their minds later

make sure to get a homestead exemption if your state has one this can keep your taxes from rising quite as and in some cases the county assessment office can get you a retroactive refund when your application is approved   also if you really think you 're paying too high based on home resale values around you most county assessors will also let you dispute your valuation a higher value is great if you intend to sell not so good if you 're staying long term kind of like the difference between trading bonds and investing in them   also as i think one of the other posters pointed out you can usually make extra small payments and direct them to escrow or to principal

you can illustrate why expense ratio fees are in the numerator with an extreme example   let 's say you have $ 100 in a mutual fund their expense ratio is 50 your nominal return is 900 and inflation is 900   thus without the expense your investment would give you $ 100 in present value because your return and inflation are identical and $ 1000 in future value   so with the expense ratio of 50 and no change in present value you can reason that you would expect the expense ratio will eat half the present value   if you apply your equation and include expenses in the numerator you end up with   100 + + 9 = $ 50 present value as you would expect   if you apply the manager 's assumption that fees are applied external to inflation then you end up with   100 1 + + 9 100 1 + 9 .50 = $ present value   with this example you can see applying the fees externally acts as though they are charging you the fees on future returns today   edit   it 's probably not worth fighting with someone senior to you over as inflation rates are noisy estimates to begin with and the difference between these is typically not material to the decision being made but pissing off someone senior by showing them their math is off will probably have a material impact on you

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

what you put that money into is quite relevant it depends on how soon you will need some or all of that money   it has been very useful to me to divide my savings into three areas   1 very short term oops funds this is for when you forget to put something in your budget or when a monthly bill is very high this month put this money into passbook savings   2 emergency funds that are needed quite infrequently used for such things as when you go to the hospital or an appliance breaks down put this money in higher yeald savings but where it can be accessed   3 retirement savings put this money into a never draw on it till you retire make no loans against it when you change jobs roll over into a self directed ira and invest in an etf that pays dividends reinvest the dividend each month   so like i said where you put that money depends on how soon you will need it

both of these are important points i think that what /u is saying and what most people miss when it comes to ai machine learning is that it 's often nothing more than a more advanced form of logistic regression e.g. neural networks so to a degree machine learning is nothing terribly new it just requires much more processing power and has been largely limited by that   the part where it becomes a black box is that with a regular logistic regression you select your variables interactions etc you 're defining the model whereas with machine learning approaches you 're still selecting variables but you 're not defining how they interact with each other and while you can technically look inside and see what it 's doing it 's not something that really makes a ton of sense   i can easily explain a coefficient on a standard logistic regression or model but what does the weight of the 6th node of the 3rd layer of a neural network mean

the answer depends on the specific instrument to which you are referring it is possible to make straight bets that are cash settled and in which the underlying commodity or instrument will never be bought or sold   it is also possible to have such a contract be settled in the underlying if the cash value is appropriate then the cash settlement can be used to purchase the underlying directly if necessary   physical delivery was predominant until the last few decades   most traders as opposed to or are going to prefer cash settled contracts as opposed to physical delivery it is possible to make trades with a brokerage firm such that the firm pays if the trader wins the bet   the firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market   the cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite matching bet in this way brokers are following market price while traders are setting it financially options and contracts can be settled for cash or for the underlying and they can be made directly with the opposite or with a neutral dealer

even if the price of your home did match inflation or better and that 's a question i 'll let the other answers address i propose that owning a home by itself is not a sufficient hedge against inflation consider inflation will inflate your living expenses if you 're lucky they 'll inflate at the average if you 're unlucky a change in your spending patterns perhaps age related could result in your expenses rising faster than inflation look at the sub indexes of the cpi without income also rising with inflation or better how will you cope with rising living expenses each passing year advancing living expenses risk a static income your home is an illiquid asset generally speaking it neither generates income for you nor can you sell only a portion at best owning your principal residence helps you avoid a rent expense and inflation in rents but rent is only one of many living expenses some consider a reverse mortgage an option to tap home equity but it has a high cost in other words if you do n't want to be forced to liquidate sell your home you 'll also need to look at ways to ensure your income sources rise with inflation i.e. look at your cash flow not just your net worth hence investing in housing as in your own principal residence is not an adequate hedge against inflation if you owned additional properties to generate rental income and you retained pricing power so you could increase the rent charged at least in line with inflation your situation would be somewhat improved except you would perhaps be adopting another problem too high a concentration in a single asset class consequently i would look at ways other than housing to hedge against inflation consider other kinds of investments safe as houses may be a but it is no guarantee

with all due respect to economics everywhere and the armchair economist i think they overlook one very basic fact the alternative to buying popcorn   at the cinema is buying it cheaper at the store or making your own and bringing it to the cinema is something you tend to do with a date and sometimes your friends and who wants to look cheap to their date and perhaps their spouse friends bringing popcorn to the cinema   this effect together with convenience is probably the reason why popcorn can remain so expensive at cinemas

generally speaking you are not allowed to falsely represent models in a material way with a general model release for example you ca n't take a stock photo and put them in an ad that says i support puppy mills making it look as though the model in question holds such a political view   sexual misrepresentation is covered under this as well so this model definitely has a case that her image was misused the same would not apply to statements generally not considered sensitive like shop at safeway or dr. gives great smiles as long as they do not appear to be quotes from the model    beyond such legal shenanigans however a large multinational corporation such as burger king should really be hiring their own model for an ad campaign such as this who knows exactly what she is getting into simply as a matter of responsibility and good taste it is n't good pr to choose some poor individual and misuse them in a way they find since you can certainly find a model who would sign on for such a campaign in good faith

technically anyone who advises how you should spend or proportion your money is a financial adviser   a person that does it for money is a financial advisor difference in spelling financial advisors are people that basically build manage or advise on your portfolio   they have a little more institutional knowledge on how where to invest given your goals since they do it on a daily basis they may know a little more than you since they deal with many different assets stocks etfs mutual funds bonds insurances home health life reits options futures leaps etc there is risk in everything you do which is why what they propose is generally according to the risk level you want to assume   since you 're younger your risk level could be a little higher as you approach retirement your risk level will be lower   risk level should be associated with how likely you 're able to your assets if you lose it all as well as your likelihood to enjoy the fruits from your investments financial advisors are great however be careful about them   some are payed on commissions which are given money for investing in packages that they support   basically they could get paid $ $ for putting you in a losing situation   also be careful because some announce that they are fee based these advisers often receive fees as well as commissions   basically associate the term commission with conflict of interest so you want a fee only advisor which is n't persuaded to steer you wrong another thing worth noting is that some trading companies like e*trade has financial services that may be free depending how much money you have with them   generally $ 50 k is on the lower end to get a financial advisors   there has been corruption in the past where financial advisors are only given a limited number of accounts to manage that means they took the lower valued ones and basically ran them into the ground so they could get newer ones from the lot that were hopefully worth more the larger their portfolio the more $ $ they could make higher fees or more commissions and less work less accounts to have to deal with that 's subjective since the spread of the wealth was accross many markets

here 's a link to the actual piketty   something i found interesting from it   we find that the of top incomes has mostly been a capital driven phenomenon since the late 1990s there is a widespread view that rising income inequality mostly owes to booming wages at the top end i.e. a rise of the working rich our results confirm that this view is correct from the 1970s to the 1990s but in contrast to earlier decades the increase in income concentration over the last fifteen years owes to a boom in the income from equity and bonds at the top the working rich are either turning into or being replaced by top earners became younger in the 1980s and 1990s but have been growing older since then

as a general rule of thumb age and of your profession in terms of high and stable wages in most cases imply that you have the ability to accept higher than average level of risk by investing in stocks rather than bonds in search for capital appreciation rather than income simply because you have more time to offset any losses should you have any and make capital gains dividend yield is mostly after by people at or near retirement who need to have some cash inflows but can not accept high risk of equity investments hence low risk dividend stocks and greater allocation to bonds since you accept passive investment approach you could consider investing in target date funds which re allocate assets roughly from to lower risk gradually as the fund approaches it target which for you could be your retirement age or even beyond also why are you so hesitant to consider taking professional advice from a financial adviser

the answer to this question will vary considerably by state and how utilities are regulated in your area in new york energy supply companies are almost always a ripoff for consumers versus the old style regulated utility in ny the utility supply markups are tightly regulated but are less regulated   you also need to really understand the marketplace rules for locking in a price if you can lock in the july price for natural gas for a year that rocks there are other factors as well but even then its a real bet since weather and supply factors can have a dramatic effect on gas prices in the winter imo the best bet is to run with the market rates and bank the efficiency improvements that you build into your home over time some utilities offer budget plans that smooth out your payments without interest i 'd recommend that route if predictable bills are your goal

as well as paying 8 interest on your loan i.e. $ you 're also wasting money on the car depreciation insurance etc so it 's worth a lot to you to get out of it set against that is the risk of having to borrow the $ 3000 you 'll be taking from your emergency fund at a higher interest rate say 30 for at most 6 months which would only cost you $ 300-$400 even if it happens you 'll also be giving up a small amount of interest on the $ 3000 but at current interest rates that pretty much negligible there is a small chance that an emergency would also cause the available credit on your credit cards to disappear but in the short term that should be pretty unlikely so i think the balance is overwhelmingly in favour of getting out of the loan as soon as you can

simple math take the sale proceeds after trade expenses and divide by cost subtract 1 and this is your return for example buy at 80 sell at 100 = 1.25 your return is 25 to annualize this return multiply by 365 over the days you were in that stock if the above stock were held for 3 months you would have an annualized return of 100   there 's an alternative way to annualize in the same example above take the days invested and dive into 365 here you get 4 i suggested that 25 x 4 = 100 others will ask why i do n't say 1.25 ^ 4 = so the return is in other words compound the return a single day trade noon to noon the next day returning just 1 would multiply to 365 over a year ignoring the fact there are about 250 trading days but 1.01 ^ 365 is or a return for long periods the compounding makes sense of course the i hope to see should double my money in 9 years not 12 but taking the short term trades and compounding creates odd results of little value

as mentioned in the comments there are costs associated with owning living in an apartment first you have to pay maintenance charges on a monthly basis and perhaps also property tax find out the overall outgoings when you live in that apartment add the emi payments to the bank it should not be way higher than your current rent as an advantage you are getting an asset when you buy an apartment rent is a complete loss least financial terms so real estate is in general a good idea over paying rent as for the loan part personal loans are by far the most expensive of loans as they are in general unsecured loans but do check with your bank one way is to try and get a student loan which should be cheaper if you can borrow from family that is the best option you could return the money with perhaps bank fixed deposit rates it is better to pay family interest than bank if none of the options are workable then personal loan is something you need to look at with a clear goal to pay it off as soon as possible and try to take it in stages as an when you require it and if possible avoid taking all the at once

yes it 's a good idea to have a separate business account for your business because it makes accounting and bookkeeping that much easier you can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees you may or may not want an overdraft account for example or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards when i started my business i opened a business checking account and met with my banker every year just to show them how the business was doing and to keep the relationship going eventually when i wanted to establish a business line of credit it was easier to set up because i they were already familiar with my business its revenue and needs for a line of credit you can set up a solo 401k with your bank too and they 'll be very happy to do so but i recommend shopping around for options i 've found that the dedicated investment firms schwab fidelity etc tend to have better options fees and features for investment accounts just because a specific bank handles your checking account does n't mean you need to use that bank for everything lastly i use completely different banks for my personal life and for my business maybe i 'm paranoid but i just do n't want all my finances in the same place for both privacy reasons and to avoid having all my eggs in the same basket just something to consider i do n't really have a completely sane reason for using completely different banks but it helps me sleep

i am not aware of a single instrument that what you are after but the components do exist at least in canada there are many options traded on the montreal exchange that are based on toronto etfs   all the standard tsx etfs are represented as well as some of the more exotic   with a regular investment account approved for options you should be able to do what you want in a parallel vein there are also double down and up etfs   one such example are the horizons series of etfs   they are designed to return double the market up or down on a daily basis and reset daily   they do need to be watched closely however good luck

the pricing model makes all inverse leveraged etf decay over time when the price gets low the manager can once again do a stock split to make the share price more attractive the manager usually states a price range that will prompt a stock split but actually doing the split is at their discretion the russell 2000 has to decrease a lot yes but probably just a flash crash of 10 in a day can extend the to extremely high bids and asks a flash crash that far through the order books would wreck the liquidity of all the underlying assets and especially the derivatives products based on derived from those assets so a mathematical formula to price the etf during a period of high volatility and low liquidity becomes a lot less of a science and more of a random walk a good example of this would be to look at the 2010 flash crash and the price behavior of the etf where it spiked to $ from maybe $

from some of your previous questions it seems like you trade quite often so i am assuming you are not a buy and hold person if that is the case then have you got a written trading plan considering you do n't know what to do after a 40 drop i assume the answer to this is that you do n't have a trading plan before you enter any trade you should have your exit point for that trade pre determined and this should be included in your trading plan you should also include how you pick the shares you buy do you use fundamental analysis technical analysis a combination of the two a dart board or some kind of advisory service then finally and most importantly you should have your position sizing and risk management incorporated into your plan if you are doing all this and had automatic stop loss orders placed when you entered your buy orders then you would have been out of the stock well before your loss got to 40 if you are looking to hang on and hoping for the stock to recover remember with a 40 drop the stock will now need to rise by 67 just for you to break even on the trade even if the stock did recover how long would it take there is the potential for opportunity loss waiting for this stock to recover and that might take years if the stock has fallen by 40 in a short time it is most likely that it will continue to fall in the short term and if it falls to 50 then the recovery would need to be 100 just for you to break even leave your emotions out of your trading as much as possible have a written trading plan which incorporates your risk management a good book to read on the psychology of the markets position sizing and risk management is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp i actually went to see him talk tonight in sydney all the way over from the usa

i would also consider the following factors how stable is your income   are you in an industry that could vanish in the near future   how long would it take you to replace this income   if you are at risk then you need to consider that your lenders do not care how fast you 've paid down your debt   all the care about is that you make next month 's payment   you need to have liquid reserves available to weather any storm current wisdom is 3 6 months expenses   it may be prudent to put this money in gics or t bills   there may be an early withdrawal penalty but at least you wo n't lose your house obviously this is n't as important when you can actually retire all debt what 's your debt level   if it 's more than 3x income then reducing that number might be the most prudent on another note what is your expected retirement income   iras defer the tax to a later year but if you expect a great pension it is feasible that you might be in a higher tax bracket on retirement when you withdraw the funds than you are now a situation that makes indexed retirement planning counterproductive rich people do n't buy iras

some people would think that the government should mandate that walmart pay their employees more    however that wo n't stop other companies from pushing the cost of business unto taxpayers it seems that walmart is acting perfectly rational as a business would   i think the better solution would be to stop enabling these companies with a backdoor subsidy and stop giving out free money and handouts to people when people realize they wo n't get free money from the government they will demand better wages from companies or wo n't bother to work there   the best solution which runs counter intuitive to the previous solution and the one i 'm leaning towards is it is completely transparent and eliminates the need for every other government program then people could work at walmart for fun or walmart could offer a wage that was enticing

i do n't know much about how student loans work so there might be some caveats e.g. does the interest rate stay constant do you get a discount if you pay off early etc ignoring those caveats the interest on you student loan looks quite small depends a bit where you are in the world but it seems very likely that you can get more interest than that on a 100 guaranteed investment form e.g. term bank deposits so it seems a no brainer to not pay back you student loan and invest the money securely for a higher interest rate instead similar situation when you think about taking the money as a down payment for a house more factors come into play here

right when you have an influx of people willing to work for lower wages it depresses wages    scandinavia has the political will and the geographic location such that there is not a large influx of labor from poor countries coming in to work at higher wages than they are used to but lower wages than the locals are used to    having an homogenous population makes it politically easy to have tight immigration and border controls being in northern europe makes it easy to not have a ton of migrant workers from third world countries right next door   this is n't rocket science

i am a bit confused here as to how a 4 k loan will negatively effect your credit score if payments are made on time   fico scores are based upon how well you borrow   if you borrow pay back on time your score will not go down   perhaps a bit in the short run when you first secure the loan but that should come back quickly   in the long run it will help improve your score which seems like it would be more important to you having the provider finance your loan will probably not show up on your credit unless you fail to pay and they send to collections if the score is so important to you which i think is somewhat unwise then use a credit card   with a 750 you should be able to get a pretty good rate but assume it is 18   in less then 9 months you will have it paid off paying about $ in interest   you could consider that a part of the cost of doing business for maintaining a high credit score   again not what i would advise but it might meet your needs one alternative is go with lending club   with that kind of score you are looking at 7 or so   at $ 500 a month you are still looking at just over 8 months and paying about $ 100 in interest   much less money for improving your credit score edit based upon the comment my understanding is that using a significant portion of your available credit balance is bad for your credit even if you pay your bills on time define bad   as i said it might go down slightly in the short term   in three months you will have almost 33 of the loan paid off which is significantly lower then the original balance   if you go the credit card route you may be approved for quite a bit more then the 4000 which may not move the needle at all   are you planning on buying a home in the next 90 days   if not why does a small short term dip matter   will your life really be effected if your score goes down to 720 for three months keep in mind this is exactly the kind of behavior that the banks want you to engage in   if you worship your fico score which gives no indication of wealth then you should do exactly what i am suggesting

technical analysis is based more on psychology than anything else as an example if an analyst estimates or believes that a stock is undervalued or simply wants to re balance their portfolio then they will buy some amount moving the price up others in the market see the upwards move as the start of an upwards trend an indication that the stock is undervalued or perhaps even that an insider is trading ahead of better than expected data from the firm they then buy the stock creating a self fulfilling prophecy and pulling more traders in as they see an upward trend being confirmed this is even more pronounced in a bear market as fear is an even stronger driver when a trader sees a stock is falling they are more likely to jump to the conclusion that it is due to expected poor performance of the firm and that the firm and the economy are both in trouble and going down than to think that it is simply a or a large investor re balancing etc to quote credit suisse 1   a chart is a mirror    of the mood of the crowd and not of the fundamental factors thus technical analysis is the    analysis of human mass psychology therefore it is also called behavioral finance the underlying truth that makes technical analysis work is that people are predictably irrational at least in the short run and tend to follow the same patterns of thought references 1 2 3 cfa level 1 syllabus

are financial institutions less likely to lend me money because of my age yes   but they are especially unlikely to loan you money because you have little income    or because they know i avoid interest by paying things off aggressively this wo n't affect them   but you might ask yourself how much credit history you have   credit history can include all of loans credit cards rent utilities etc   you mention three loans   but you do n't mention rent or utilities   you may simply not have much credit history even if what you do have is good    but again the biggest thing that they will look at is your income history   if you have a small income then it does n't matter what your payment history is   they do n't want to loan money to people who need money   they want to loan money to people who do n't need to borrow but are instead bringing a future purchase into the present    the ideal recipient is someone who has a high income and spends it all every month   such a person is likely to borrow heavily but be able to keep up the payments    obsessing about your ability to borrow is probably the wrong approach   instead focus on how you can meet your goals without borrowing   eventually your ability to pay will catch up   then they 'll offer you money   of course you might not need it then    note that when i say little income i 'm talking about their perspective   you may be fully on track and making decent money or even very good money for your age   but they 're looking for people who are mature in their careers and regularly bringing home large sums but who spend it faster than they can get it

since you ask how do i do it my frugality does n't come from budgeting or even half so much from keeping money away from myself though mostly one way retirement accounts help it 's a matter of world view spending and shopping for things you do n't need is a vice limit your in it i 've also made wasteful purchases in my life when i find myself considering buying something that i do n't really need i ask myself whether it will end up like like the stupid cleaner gadget from the image that i used twice or the bluetooth that spent 98 of its time lost and .02 of its time in my ear or the little sony laptop which was great on the train but probably cost 8 times as much as an and did n't do way too much more in my defense on that one it was just before were really taking off but i still felt bad about it the next year i 've also got two savings goals the first is responsible and very big financial stability a year 's expenses plus money for a down payment on a house a california house in a good neighborhood the second is personal and just medium big a large musical instrument i 've decided not to spend money on the second until i 'm financially stable and i have enough money to take care of the first so that makes me more willing to scrimp and save to pursue the first than i would be otherwise advice for others ask yourself why are you buying that thing you can survive without it ca n't you you did n't need it a week ago did you does the old one have holes in it or something or will you at least use it regularly for years why are n't you buying the cheaper kind or buying it used

gold 's value starts with the fact that its supply is steady and by nature it 's durable in other words the amount of gold traded each year the supply and demand is small relative to the existing total stock this acting as a bit of a throttle on its value as does the high cost of mining mines will have yields that control whether it 's profitable to run them a mine may have a $ production cost in which case it 's clear they should run full speed now with gold at $ 1200 but if it were below $ 650 or so it may not be worth it it also has a history that goes back it 's valued because it always was john maynard keynes referred to gold as an archaic relic and i tend to agree you are right the topic is controversial for short periods gold will provide a decent hedge but no better than other financial instruments we are now in an odd time where the stock market is generally flat to where it was 10 years ago and both cash or most commodities were a better choice   look at sufficiently long periods of time and gold fails in my history i graduated college in 1984 and in the summer of 82 played in the commodities market gold peaked at $ 850 or so now it 's $ 1200 50 over 30 years is hardly a of value now is it yet i recall aug 25 1987 when the dow peaked at no i did n't call the top but i did talk to a friend advising that i ignore the short term at 25 with little invested i only concerned myself with long term plans the dow crashed from there but even today just over 18,000 the return has averaged plus dividends a lengthy tangent but important to understand a gold fan will be able to produce his own observation citing that some percent of one 's holding in gold adjusted to maintain a balanced allocation would create more positive returns than i claim for a large enough portfolio that 's otherwise well diversified this may be true just not something i choose to invest in last if you wish to buy gold avoid the hard metal gld trades as 1/10 oz of gold and has a tiny commission as it trades like a stock the buy sell on a 1 oz gold piece will cost you 4 6 that 's no way to invest update 29 years after that lunch in 1987 the dow was at a return of cagr plus dividends another 6 years since this question was asked and gold has n't moved $ and 6 years worth of fees 2.4 if you buy the gld etf from the 82 high of $ 850 to now 34 years the return has a cagr of or after fees to be fair i picked a relative high that $ 850 but i did the same choosing the pre crash high on the dow

you are correct   credit card companies charge the merchant for every transaction   but the merchant is n't necessarily going to give you discount for paying in cash   the idea is that by providing more payment options they increase sales covering the cost of the transaction fee   that said some merchants require a minimum purchase for using a credit card though this may be against the policies of some issuers in the u.s. i have no idea about india also correct   they hope that you 'll carry a balance so that they can charge you interest on it   some credit cards are setup to charge as many fees as they possibly can   these are typically those low limit cards that are marketed as good ways to build up your credit   most are basically scams in the fact that the fees are outrageous update regarding minimum purchases apparently visa is allowing minimum purchase requirements in the u.s. of $ 10 or less   however it seems that mastercard still does not allow them for the most part   moral of the story research the credit card issuers policies   a further update regarding minimum purchases in the us merchants will be allowed to require a minimum purchase of up to $ 10 for credit card transactions   i am guessing that prompted the visa rule change mentioned above more detail can be found here in this answer along with a link to the text of the bill itself

simply put for a mortgage interest is charged only on the balance as well think of it this way on a $ 100 k 6 loan on day one 1/2 is $ 500 and the payment is just under $ 600 so barely $ 100 goes to principal but the last payment of $ 600 is nearly all principal   by the way you are welcome to make extra principal payments along with the payment due each month an extra $ in this example paid each and every month will drop the term to just 15 years think about that 40 higher payment all attacking the principal and you cut the term by 1/2 the time

first i 'm really sorry to hear about your mother my wife was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer so i know that there is a possibility that your mind is in survival mode trying to preserve as much as you can in the way of things that you can effect that 's how i 've been feeling recently having a loved one with cancer is really tough because there is absolutely positively nothing tangible that you can do to change the fact that they have cancer you will have to ask yourself some questions how important is it that your mom can stay in her house moving could add some unneeded stress how may years have you been contributing to your 401k if you have 30 years left you could have enough time to recover some of your losses from reducing the amount of money you have given up for your mom will your mom be able to pay you back for paying the taxes over time or would this be a gift have her doctors told her that she has n months left what is the next step after you are able to pay her taxes and save the house   someone close to me recently told me that there is no point in trying to save for someone for the future if you ca n't sustain them until they get to that future what will happen to your mom if she loses her house will it make it easier or harder for her to recover if she can stay to paraphrase someone famous you ca n't take a loan out for your retirement but you could take a loan out for this event at any rate good luck my thoughts are with you and your mother

i feel i should respond to you if not only for our yang similarity in names i 'm also in finance or rather a recent grad and i ca n't help but picture you as someone who feels investment banking is the end all career and does n't really enjoy the industry that much in the first place as many people mentioned before attitude goes a long way but i think you need to reassess whether you actually like finance or if you 're in it just for the money in either case the motivation should already be there for you to achieve so what 's stopping you

in maryland a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit   the interest is simple interest it does not compound the interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years   before october 1 2004 the rate was 4   until january 1 2015 the rate was 3   currently the rate is 1.5 or the simple interest rate accrued at the daily u.s. treasury yield curve rate for one year as of the first business day of each year whichever is greater   this year the rate is 1.5   maryland 's department of housing and community development has a security deposit calculator for easy calculation of this interest however it only works for deposits since january 1 2015 it is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made or if the rate changes over the years    at most if you get 4 interest every year i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 43   the interest is accrued every 6 months so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your year with the new law that took effect this year interest is accrued monthly at least if the interest rate changes with the new laws i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 + $ 158 3 + $ 158 1.5 0.5 some text on the security deposit calculator suggests that the laws for prince george 's county are different than the rest of the state   if you are in that county you 'll need to check the local ordinances to see what security deposit policies apply

adapted from an answer to a somewhat different question generally 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an ira so unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to and you think those investments are where you want your money to be roll over your 401k assets into an ira but i do n't think that is the case here   if you had a traditional 401k the assets will roll over into a traditional ira if it was a roth 401k into a roth ira if you had started a little earlier you could have considered considered converting part or all of your traditional ira into a roth ira assuming that your 2012 taxable income will be smaller this year because you have quit your job of course this may still hold true in 2013 as well   as to which custodian to choose for your rollover ira i recommend investing in a low cost index   mutual fund such as vfinx which tracks the s&p 500 index then do not look at how that fund is doing for the next thirty years   this will save you from the common error made by many investors when they pull out at the first downturn and thus end up buying high and selling low also do not chase after exchange traded mutual funds or etfs as many will likely recommend until you have acquired more savvy or interest in investing than you are currently not knowing which company stock you have it is hard to make a recommendation about selling or holding on but since you are glad to have quit your job you might want to consider making a clean break and selling the shares that you own in your ex employer 's company keep the $ 35 k less the $ 12 k that you will use to pay off the student loan as your emergency fund pay off your student loan right away since you have the cash to do it

great topic as interest rate swaps are one of the most commonly used derivatives by bank in the simplest form an interest rate swap is an exchange of payments between two parties    say party a has a $ 100 loan with a fixed 4.25 interest rate and party b also has a $ 100 loan with a variable rate lets say prime plus 1 prime is 3.25 so b is also paying 4.25    party a thinks interest rates are going to go lower and wants to lower his interest expense while party b is a small company and does n't want to be exposed to variable interest rates and needs to have a steady cash flow to project his budget   party a and b agree to enter into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of $ 100 where party a agree to pay b prime plus 1 fixed for floating and party b agrees to pay a 4.25 floating for fixed for some period of time they agree upon usually the maturity of the loan   now from the start the swap has a market value of $ 0 since a and b both receive the same as they are paying as interest rates move the value of the swap moves say interest rates fall and prime is now 2 b still pays 4.25 to a he agreed to pay a fixed 4.25 no matter what and a only pays 3 prime plus 1 to b. remember the terms of the individuals loans did not change so a owes $ 4.25 to his bank and b owes $ 3 to his bank party a uses the $ 4.25 from b to pay his bank and pays $ 3 to b. party a has lowered his interest expense by $ 1.25 and his position is considered in the money which means he is benefitting from the transaction party b gets $ 3 from a but still owes his bank $ 4.25 in reality the transaction nets out to b paying a $ 1.25 rather than both a and b paying each other different amounts b is out of the money because in aggregate he is paying a. the market value of the swap would be the present value of that $ 1.25 benefit a receives discounted using expected future interest rates the same number but negative is the value to b   please ask if you have additional questions or need

i think of these things in terms of risk   investing in individual stocks is risky and investing in brand new individual stocks is riskier still however the payoff can be quite high   the fact that you work at the company increases your exposure if the company goes under then not only have you lost your investment but you 've lost your job and income as well   it really depends on how much of your total portfolio this investment represents consider the following if you can say yes to all or most of these then a small investment in your company is fine if you end up losing your investment you 'll still be okay   i think it can help a company when the employees have a little skin in the game i hope it pays out big for you

you probably bought the stock near the peak because it 's been up a lot lately that 's the easiest way to lose money you need to go back and do some basic research the stock appears to have been expensive around 75 why is that the stock seems to be in a comfortable level around 45 why is that maybe it 's too expensive around 45 based on the p e ratio or other measures maybe you should buy more at 45 where it is cheap even though 75 is too expensive the key is to study the stock where it is today 45 47 ask yourself what you would do at today 's price and today 's fundamentals that will also save you from paying 75 for a stock worth 45 and should save you from paying 45 for a stock if it is only worth 35

simply if your stock is still rising in price keep it if it is falling in price sell it and pay off your mortgage to know when to do this is very easy if it is currently rising you can put a trailing stop loss on it and sell it when it drops and hits your stop loss a second easy method is to draw an uptrend line under the increasing price and then sell when the price drops down below the uptrend line as per the chart below   this will enable you to capture the bulk of the price movement upward and sell before the price drops too far down you can then use the profits after tax to pay down your mortgage of course if the price is currently in a downtrend sell it asap

talk to the property manager and explain your situation they may be more willing to work with you than you think at the very least they will tell you if you should even bother filling out the application in most cases they are obligated to do a background and credit check so you will have to provide them with the required information one way or another what they are really looking for is your ability to pay the rent property managers take a lot more things into consideration than a mortgage company would for a loan if you have a history of paying on time in the past a reference from a previous landlord perhaps and if you show proof of the ability to pay now and in the future they will usually take that into consideration regardless of what the credit check says it all depends on how motivated they are to fill the rental and how willing they are to take on a potential risk keep in mind property managers do n't make money on empty rentals

does the money lending between us need to be reported in our tax    reports no will he be taxed more because of lending the money to me yes will i be taxed more because of borrowing the money from him no how shall we report it so as to minimize our taxes you can not what is reported on your tax returns is the income a loan is not an income so nothing gets reported however when you repay the loan assuming it has interest the lender has income the interest interest income is reported on schedule b of the regular tax return or in the case of non resident for tax purposes on line 9 of 1040nr it is taxed as ordinary income and since you 're both foreigners the lender should look into the treaty provisions that might be relevant generally it is not exempt from taxable income based on treaty exemptions for students which is only for earned income but there might be other rules in the treaty regarding interest income if there 's no fair market or higher interest then there 's assumed interest at the irs mandated rates which is considered a gift if it amounts to more than the yearly gift exemption the lender may be liable for gift tax depending on the lender 's and your status and again see treaties loan without an obligation to repay and without actual repaying will also be considered a gift for tax purposes if the lender has no intentions of having the loan repaid i.e. making a gift it will be better to pay your tuition bills instead of actually giving you the money tuition is exempt from gift tax talk to a cpa ea licensed in your state for a proper tax advice on this issue

i regularly transfer money from the us to europe and have found a simple us check a pretty useful way if you are not in a hurry you write a us dollar based check to yourself and deposit it to a bank in your new location which implies you open an account in france yes it takes some days 7 days and then the money will be deposited the local bank will convert it so you can walk around and pick a bank that has a rate concept that pleases you before you open the account and there will be no fees on the us side which means you can get every last dollar out of the account also you have the control over how much you pull when you can write yourself as many checks as you like assuming you took your checkbook this was the best rate i could get considering that wire transfers cost significant fees there are probably other options if you are talking serious money like 100 or more there will better ways but most banks will be eager to help you with that note that as long as you make interest income in the us you are required to file taxes in the us your visa status and location do n't matter

cds spreads have little to do with the already issued debt itself cds spreads broadcast riskiness for current and future market participants   since existing debt is constantly bought and sold higher cds spreads mean the existing debt becomes ever more illiquid it means that those who do hold that debt can not price it accurately as a result of said illiquidity and can not sell it without taking a haircut   it also means that new debt can not be issued without the existing debt taking a haircut or being defaulted on because at least part of the new debt would ostensibly be used to pay off the old debt    if shares are used to securitize debt than a fall in those shares puts into question the ability to fully service that debt the collateral is the balance sheet of the debtor    mf global does n't issue their own currency they can not devalue their debt

welcome to the what should otherwise be a simple choice turns into a huge analysis debate if the choice were actually simple we 've have one golden answer here and close others as duplicate but new questions continue to bring up different scenarios that impact the choice   4 years ago i wrote an article in which i discussed the density of your ira in that article i acknowledge that with no other tax favored savings you can pack more value into the roth   in hindsight i failed to add some key points first let 's go back to what i 'd describe as my main thesis a retired couple hits the top of the 15 bracket with an income of    $ i include just the standard deduction and exemptions the    tax on this gross sum is $ for an average rate of the tax paid or avoided upon deposit is one 's marginal rate but    at retirement the withdrawals first go through the zero bracket i.e.    the std deduction and exemptions then 10 then 15 the above is the simplest snapshot i am retired and our return this year included sch a itemized deductions property tax interest insurance donations added up fast and from a gross income ira withdrawal well into the 25 bracket the effective average rate was reported as 7.3 if we had saved in roth accounts it would have been subject to 25   i 'd suggest that it 's this phenomenon the save at marginal 25 but withdraw at average effect that account for much of the resulting tax savings that the ira provides   the way you are asking this you 've been focusing on one aspect i believe the density issue that assumes the investor has no 401(k option if i were building a spreadsheet to address this i 'd be sure to consider the fact that in a taxable account long term gains are taxed at 15 for higher earners i take the liberty to ignore   that wealthier taxpayers will pay a maximum 20 tax on long term capital gains this higher rate applies when your adjusted gross income falls into the top 39.6 tax bracket and those in the 10 or 15 bracket pay 0 with median household income at $ 56 k in 2016 and the 15 bracket top at $ 76 k this suggests that most people gov data shows $ 75 k is percentile have an effective unlimited roth so long as they invest in a way that avoids short term gains they can rebalance often enough to realize lt gains and pay zero tax   it 's likely the $ earner does have access to a 401(k or other higher deposit account if they do n't i 'd still favor pretax iras with $ 11 k for the couple still 10 or so of their earnings it would be a shame to lose that zero bracket of that first $ 20 k withdrawal at retirement again working backwards the $ 78 k withdrawal would take nearly $ 2 m in pretax savings to generate all in today 's dollars

this question is very open ended but i 'll try to answer parts of it an employer can offer shares as part of a compensation package instead of paying cash the employer can use the money to buy up shares and give them to the employees this is done to keep employees for longer periods of time and the employer may also want to create more insider ownership for a number of reasons another possibility is issuance of secondary offerings that are partially given to employees secondary offerings often lower the price of the shares in the market and create an incentive for employees to stay until the stock price rises all of these conditions can be stipulated look up golden handcuffs usually stock gifts are only given to a few high level employees and as part of a bonus package it is very unusual to see a mature company regularly give away large amounts of stock as this is a frowned upon practice start ups often pay their employees with stock up until the company is acquired or goes public

no you ca n't do this indefinitely for one you ca n't just take money out as home equity with no strings attached the cash out is done as a loan often a heloc or second mortgage and you have to make payments the lender will always make sure you are able to afford the payments at some point you wo n't qualify for the loan because of insufficient income or too many previous liens on the property while home values often go up there 's no guarantee and your examples are more than a bit optimistic

the 3 and 9 figures are based on the cost of borrowing money and all the other ownership costs associated with real estate   from the same article because it 's usually still much cheaper to rent than to own the same    size and quality house in the same school district in rich    neighborhoods annual rents are typically only 3 of purchase price    while mortgage rates are 4 with fees so it costs more to borrow the    money as it does to borrow the house renters win and owners lose    worse total owner costs including taxes maintenance and insurance    come to about 8 of purchase price which is more than twice the cost    of renting and wipes out any income tax benefit imagine you are renting a house if the cost of your annual rent is lower than x then renting is obviously the best idea from a monetary calculation if rent is greater than y being a landlord makes more sense in the middle it is debatable and the non monetary reasons need to be considered

i 'm going to suggest a slightly different approach most answers seem to suggest paying off the lower rate card to clear it some answers comments also talk about emergency funds one risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk to prevent you re spending the money if you do n't trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember you 're always free to ask for a limit decrease but if you want access to emergency funds then i would suggest paying half onto each card that way if one card cuts you off you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency

honestly i would look for a house you can afford and one that is below the maximum amount of what they are willing to lend you   the reason is owning a house is not a quick loan that you can pay off in a year or two unless you 're rich then i would question why are you even bothering with a loan this is a long term commitment can you honestly say your job will provide the money for the mortgage the upkeep and remodeling of the house even if it 's the perfect house you will want to change something make the bathroom bigger put in a pool table etc etc living expenses and any life throws at you like most of us that answer will be no always have money and supplies for that rainy day for those lean days for that mortgage payment and if nothing happens you can always use the money to pay the mortgage off faster or take a vacation

your assumptions are flawed or miss crucial details an employer sponsored 401k typically limits the choices of investments whereas an ira typically gives you self directed investment choices at a brokerage house or through a bank account you are correct in noticing that you are limited in making your own pre tax contributions to a traditional ira in many circumstances when you also have an employer sponsored 401k but you miss the massive benefit you have you can rollover unlimited amounts from a traditional 401k to a traditional ira this is a benefit that far exceeds the capabilities of someone without a traditional 401k who is subject to the ira contribution limits your rollover capabilities completely gets around any statutory contribution limit you can contribution at time of writing $ 18,000 annually to a 401k from salary deferrals and an additional $ 35,000 from employer contributions for a maximum of $ 53,000 annually and roll that same $ 53,000 into an ira if you so desired that is a factor this should be with the borrowing capabilities of a 401k which vastly exceeds an ira again the main rebuttal to your assumptions is that you are not necessarily paying taxes to fund an ira

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

how does one buy this quantity of tips do you simply buy directly from the us treasury you will might have to go through a financial institution like a broker or a bank edit you can also buy bonds directly with treasurydirect is it cheaper to buy a fund that invests in tips it might be cheaper depending on the fund   itself but you ca n't know for sure the price that the fund will be worth at you payout date since bonds can go up in value and are likely to with rates this low is there a way to measure potential downside statistically speaking yes you can look at the variation in price interest of the bonds in the last years to see how they usually move then compute the price range where they are likely to be that can be wide for volatile securities but there is no guarantee that there wo n't be some black swan event that will make the price shoot up down in another word it 's speculation can i mitigate downside risk by choosing different tips maturity there are quantitative strategies to do that like finding that some products that are negatively correlated such that a loss in one is be hedged by a gain in another however those correlation are likely to be just statistics and for every product that you buy you are likely to have to pay some fees for your bank broker which can be more devastating than the inflation itself is there some other strategy i should be considering to protect my cash against inflation or maybe a mixed strategy as i wrote above trying to use complex financial products can incurs loss and will have fees both for buying and selling is it really necessary to hedge from a 2 inflation by taking such risk personally i do n't think so if i were you i would just be buying bonds maturing for your payout date that would negate the reselling risk and reduce the fees

in the united states regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by regulation t that for a non margin account 100 of a trade must be funded finra has supplemented that regulation with an rider rule rule which reads no member shall permit a customer other than a broker dealer or a designated      account to make a practice directly or indirectly of effecting transactions in a cash      account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities      no member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a      cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker dealer where      such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for a member transferring an      account which is subject to a regulation t 90-day freeze to another member firm shall      inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze it is only funds from sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities this means that an equity in one 's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds   once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds no more purchases can be made so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase margin a closed position is not considered a long or short since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss respectively thus to the market only to the creditworthiness of the clearing settling chain only open positions are considered longs or shorts a long being a possession of a security and a short being a liability because they are exposed to the market since unsettled funds are not considered longs or shorts they are not by previous trades thus only the reg t rules apply to new and current positions cash vs margin a cash account can not purchase with unsettled funds   a margin account can   this means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds   a cash account 's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds so once those are exhausted no more purchases can be made the opposite is true for cash accounts as well   unsettled securities can not be sold either in summation unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account

since your credit score is much better than hers you should apply for the credit card yourself alone to get the best chance of approval for your card of choice once you have the card you can add her as an authorized user which will get her a card of her own tied to your account   most banks will begin reporting to both of your credit reports which should help her credit score over time keep in mind that you are solely legally responsible for the debt your girlfriend will be able to make charges and will have no legal responsibility for the debt   make sure you are comfortable with that for what it is worth in general i recommend against combining your finances with someone who you are not married to but it seems that you have already done that so adding a shared credit card to your finances should n't be any worse than what you are already doing

sorry i disagree they buy government bonds currently held by private banks who hold them for account holders this increased demand for government bonds means that the yield on them decreases this means the government can then borrow at a lower rate providing the qe is n't offset by a fall in private demand for bonds as they may be seen as in terms of the risk taken private investors will then turn to other investments offering a greater return this will then increase the capital stock available and expand output thus increasing employment

you are asking multiple questions here pieces of which may have been addressed in other questions   a bond i 'm using us government bonds in this example and making the zero risk of default assumption will be priced based on today 's interest rate this is true whether it 's a 10 bond with 10 years left say rates were 10 on the 30 yr bond 20 years ago a 2 bond with 10 years or a new 3 10 year bond   the rate i use above is the coupon rate i.e. the amount the bond will pay each year in interest what 's the same for each bond is called the yield to maturity the price adjusts by the market so the return over the next ten years is the same   a bond fund simply contains a mix of bonds but in aggregate has a yield as well as a duration the time and interest weighted maturity   when rates rise the bond fund will drop in value based on this factor duration does this begin to answer your question

gt if you went somewhat into debt say $ 30k for a major with good job prospects and a high salary it will probably be a good decision which is exactly what i did and it worked out very well for me   there is still the opportunity cost i mentioned though the average person makes $ 30 k out of high school so that is more than a million dollars in opportunity costs if you go to school for four years instead of going to work far more than that if you can earn more than $ 30 k which there is a good chance you can if you have the talent to get into college   additionally if a career has good job prospects and high salaries employers are n't really going to be concerned about your education save where the law mandates it you can not be a doctor without the education by law for instance it is the lack of capable workers that drives the salaries up and it is that same lack of capable workers that force employers to consider just about anyone   there may be an argument to be made that an education can help as a signal in jobs where competition of fierce but that same competition will drive the market rate of the job way down which does n't exactly seem like a win to me   that 's awesome that it worked out for you i 'm just not sure it should be considered a safe or even good investment while the returns can be there in some cases it seems like the stakes are pretty high

i gather that while it is not illegal for a merchant to pass their payment card processing fees on to their customers directly in the form of a surcharge doing so is a violation of their merchant agreements with the payment card processor at least for visa mc it 's not has been permissible since 2013 as a result of a class action lawsuit against visa and mc it 's still prohibited by state law in 9 states   if you 're in one of those 9 states you can contact your state attorney general to report it if you 're not you can check to see if the business is complying with the rules set forth by the card brands which include signage at the point of sale a separate line item for the surcharge on the receipt a surcharge that does n't exceed 4 of the transaction etc and if they 're in violation contact the card company however some of those rules seem to matter to the card companies more than others and it 's entirely possible they wo n't do anything in which case there 's nothing you can really do

ramsey promotes growth mutual funds and says he can screen out examples of good funds with a solid history of 10 returns in a couple of minutes on morningstar   the 12 in the video is fairly unrealistic but 10 or 8 are realistic especially when you buy into the market every month at all levels rather than chasing winners buying high at 10 you will still get $ 3 million in 40 years and at 8 you 'll get $ 1.5 million you need to make sure you include reinvestment of dividends as well as mere price appreciation in these calculations of returns on investment so yes you could probably drive really nice cars this way without breaking the bank like any financial endeavor this requires hard work patience and discipline the actual work in this case would be fairly minimal in comparison to the patience and discipline if you get really lucky you might end up with millions of dollars 40 years from now if a health disaster job loss children 's college etc strikes then you it might save you from financial ruin both are better than the rat race i agree his predictions are too rosy but this ad is an emotional sales pitch designed to change goals and behavior compare it to the psychology and unrealistic claims in some of the auto commercials you see on tv

sure thing   treasuries bonds bills are what the us gov uses to borrow however it 's slightly different than taking out a loan it 's basically an agreement to give repay a set sum of money at a certain time in the future in exchange for a sum of funding that 's determined by market forces supply amp demand the difference between today 's price and the payment in the future is the interest    for example completely made up numbers   today is the government issues a bond that say it will pay who ever owns this bond $ 105 on the market decides that $ 105 from the us government paid a year from now is worth $ 100 today    in other words the us government is borrowing for one year at a rate of 5        105 100 100 = .05 = 5   now consider saudi arabia 's petroleum company aramco   because petroleum is traded in dollars when aramco makes a sale its paid in usd some of that is going to be reinvested into the company some paid out in dividends to share holders but inevitably some of that will be saved someplace where it can make interest because treasuries are traded issued in dollars and because aramco 's businesses deals primarily in dollars treasuries are the natural place to store that savings especially because the market considers them extremely safe    if they exchange the usd into the saudi currency to store the money in saudi assets aramco is subject to   exchange rate if the depreciates relative to the dollar aramco will lose wealth on the exchange back to dollars when they go to move those funds back into their business it 's in their interest to deal with assets denominated in usd i.e. t bonds in order to avoid this   so now because the saudis want t bonds as well the additional demand pushes the market price of our bond from $ 100 to $ 102 and the effective one year borrowing rate for the government goes from 5 to 2.9       105 = = 2.9   and there you have it cheaper borrowing it 's also worth noting how this encourages business around the world to deal in dollars which are directly controlled by the federal reserve this makes the us 's position extremely powerful

you 'd have to check the terms of your contract on most installment loans i think they calculate interest monthly not daily that is if you make 3 payments of $ 96 over the course of the month instead of one payment of $ at the end of the month but before the due date it makes absolutely zero difference to their interest calculation they just total up your payments for the month that 's how my mortgage works and how some past loans i 've had worked all you 'd accomplish is to cost yourself some time postage if you 're mailing payments and waste the bank 's time processing multiple payments if the loan allows you to make pre payments which i think most loans today do then what does work is to make an extra payment or an overpayment if you have a few hundred extra dollars make an extra payment this reduces your principle and reduces the amount of interest you pay every month for the remainder of the loan and if you 're paying $ 1 less in interest then that extra dollar goes against principle which further reduces the amount you pay in interest the next month this and can save you a lot in the long run better still instead of paying $ each month pay say $ 300 then every month you 're away at the principle faster and faster for example i calculate that if you 're paying $ per month you 'll pay the loan off in 72 months and pay a total of $ in interest pay $ 300 per month and you 'll pay it off in 67 months with a total of $ interest okay not a huge deal pay $ 350 per month and you pay it off in 55 months with $ interest i just did quick calculations with a spreadsheet not accurate to the penny but close enough for comparison ps this is different from revolving credit like credit cards where interest is calculated on the average daily balance with a credit card making multiple payments would indeed reduce your interest but not by much if you pay $ 100 every 10 days instead of $ 300 at the end then you 're saving the interest on 20 days x $ 100 + 10 days x $ 100 so 12.5 = 0.03 per day so 0.03 x $ = 90 cents if you 're mailing your payments the postage is 49 cents x 2 extra payments = 98 cents you 're losing 8 cents per month by doing this

several people here have highlighted the incentive agency problems that tend to naturally arise when mortgages however the market for mortgage backed securities has existed for decades and during most of that time these agency problems were held in check moreover academics knew about this problem even before the credit crisis and actually recommended the use of in order to avoid the moral hazard problems associated with securitization see 2005   so to give a compelling historical explanation for why the crisis happened when it did you need to explain what changed in the mortgage securitization market to enable these previously agency relationships to breakdown   so what changed in short the growth of the market for cdos collateralized debt obligations composed of mortgage backed securities and not the mbs market itself this market grew so rapidly in the because the ratings agencies created an opportunity for banks to take low rated mbs debt and give it a higher rating by merely it into a cdo it was ratings arbitrage through and through explanations that place the brunt of the blame on the i.e. fannie and freddie can not adequately explain why the majority of mortgage related losses during the credit crisis were concentrated in cdos of mbss and not in the vanilla mbs market   here 's what happened back in the day say pre early 2000s the agency incentive problems that naturally arise in mortgage securitization were held in check by careful institutional investors who would rigorously assess the default risk of the higher risk mbs tranches they had a deep knowledge of the mortgage business sometimes they would even go so far as manually examining the loan documentation the profile of the borrowers the quality of the collateral and so on there were a lot of buyers who were happy to purchase the aaa and aa tranches but they could afford to be because the banks who were mbss knew that without selling to the discriminating buyers of higher risk debt they would n't be able to break even    it worked a bit like a market for fine wines i do n't know much about wine but when i walk into a shop that sells fine wines i can be reasonably certain that there will be a reasonably strong relationship between price and the quality of the wine basically i get to free ride off the superior discrimination of the wine who regularly visit the shop   once the ratings agencies created the now infamous ratings arbitrage between the mbs and cdo markets the market for cdos on mbss expanded as this market grew these discriminating buyers became a proportionally smaller part of the mbs market the folks building cdos of mbss did n't know very much about the mortgage business itself instead they tended to rely on statistical default models provided by the ratings agencies that predicted the probability of mortgage default based on quantitative variables such as borrowers credit scores loan to value ratios etc    the problem is that these models used historical data that was collected back when the discriminating institutional investors kept the agency problems in the mbs market in check the growth of the cdo market spurred even more mortgage securitization which led lending standards to deteriorate because firms like countrywide knew that the cdo buyers only cared about credit scores ltv ratios etc however buyers of mbs were unable to detect these changes in default risk because the models they were using to see those changes were becoming invalidated by the growth of the cdo market itself   if you want to read more about this i 'd highly recommend 's 2011 paper in the american journal of sociology see here it 's a detailed historical account of the changes in valuation practices models used within the mbs and cdo markets and how these practices became invalidated as the cdo market grew in size   tl;dr the credit ratings created a ratings arbitrage that the banks took advantage of they are as much if not more at fault as the   for more info on the deterioration in mortgage quality in the check out    keys benjamin and 2008 did securitization lead to lax screening evidence from subprime loans   and 2008 the failure of models that predict failure distance incentives and defaults december   also the citation i mentioned above   p. 2005 the pooling and of securities a model of informed review of economic studies 35 2005

yes you can insure against the fall in price of stock by purchasing a put option   you pay for a put and if the price of the share falls below the strike price of the put then you can exercise the put   on exercise the person who sold you the put contract agrees to buy the stock for the strike price even though that strike price is higher than the market price   you can adjust the level of insurance by buying put options at higher or lower prices or buying fewer put options than shares you own leaving some shares uninsured alternatively you can minimize your risk exposure by investing in an index or other fund which gives you partial ownership in a large number of shares   that means on any given day lots of shares do worse and lots of shares do better   you can reduce the need for insurance by purchasing a lower risk lower growth financial product

for a lease your payment is a function of sale price minus residual value if the car has a low residual value then the lease payments will be higher if it has a high residual value then lease payments will be lower but the purchase price at the end of the lease will be higher potentially even higher than the kbb of the car there is no gaming the system whether you buy now or lease now and buy later you will be paying for the entire car    calculate the payments in both scenarios with appropriate interest rates money factors sale price and residual value this will demonstrate there is no free lunch to be had here also do n't forget that financing the vehicle after a three year lease will probably mean a higher interest rate than if you were to finance it all now with a purchase now you will likely get more favorable financing terms and be able to talk them down on sale price leasing will not allow such flexibility generally    tldr no that 's not how it works if you plan on owning the car for the duration of a loan e.g. 5 years it will be cheaper to just finance now

yes by paying double the amount each month you would have in effect paid the loan off in less than half the time for $ at 3 over 60 months your monthly repayments would be $ if you double your monthly repayments to $ you would end up paying the loan off by the end of the 29th months more than halving your loan term as long as there are no penalties for paying the loan off early

i was a school board member and district negotiator for the teacher contract   i came off the board in the last couple years   in this case it does n't seem like tenure is the issue   this is a seniority issue   teacher unions like most unions are strict seniority shops   that is basically the only thing that matters   tenured teachers can be let go without cause essentially only for budget reasons   districts schools will identify which grade level for elementary or what program subject the reduction in staffing will occur   the lowest senior person is let go first regardless of skill or past performance   interestingly if a teacher is certified to teach in more than 1 subject area this can also cause chaos   if that same teacher is the one who is reduced from a given department and they have higher seniority than the department where they also have certification they will bump that other teacher thus taking their job   let 's say you have a teacher who is certified in science and math in the high school setting   they are number 90 out of 200 on the seniority list   this teacher may have been teaching science for 10 years but the other teachers in that department are all higher on the seniority list   the lowest senior teacher in the math department is number 100 out of 200   if the district identifies that a reduction of 1 science teacher is necessary that teacher gets to bump the math teacher out of the job thus getting laid off so that they can fill the math slot even though they have n't taught math in over 10 years     while not in all cases often the teachers union negotiators set the stage for these type of layoffs   usually districts have only so many resources to go around   their funding is set for them by the state and any local operating levy needs to be voted into place which can be difficult   also recognize that the teachers at the table in the negotiating session are the more senior teachers in the district since they have been around longer and are much less likely to lose their jobs due to staff reductions   if the teachers union negotiates a raise that is higher than the district can support with the same number of teachers the number of teachers must be reduced   if you think the negotiators are there for all the teachers you are wrong   one of the teachers i negotiated with once said the following we would rather a higher compensation package at the expense of teacher reductions   the system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority not to provide the best education for our kids   as with this teacher they are losing a great asset because an outdated and terrible system was being upheld

if the $ 300 due on a credit card is due at the end of the month and you make 2 payments of $ 150 during the month the first half way through the month and the second at the end of the month then yes you will save on interest note if this is a credit card with an interest free period and you are paying the total amount due before the due date then it will not save you anything by paying part of it earlier interest on credit card is calculated daily so if you pay $ 150 half way through the month then you will pay 2.5 x $ 150 365 days x 15 days = $ 0.15 less in interest than if you paid the full $ 300 at the end of the month the higher the interest rate and the more you pay early the higher the savings will be

it 's good to ask this question because this is one of the fundamental in market at any time t for each product on a typical exchange there are two well defined prices at time t there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid or below could very well be waiting there forever   there 's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it 's worth so if you want to buy the product at time t you have a tough choice to make you get in line at the bid price where there 's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than ask bid quantity so you tell the exchange that you 're willing to buy at the ask price and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line now if you 're in the market for the long term the above choice is completely immaterial to you   who cares if you pay $ 10.00 1000 shares or $ 10.01 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $ 200 or $ but if you 're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon then this choice is extremely important if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid and never got filled then you missed out on some profit if you cross the spread to buy at the ask and then the price does n't go up or worse goes down you 're screwed   in order to get out of the position you 'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid meaning you 've now paid the spread twice plus transaction fees and regulatory fees for nothing all of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling

dividends are declared by the board of directors of a corporation on date a to stock holders of record on date b a later date these stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date c the so called payment date all of these dates are announced on the first declaration date if there is no announcement no dividend will be paid the stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the   date it goes ex   but then moves in price to reflect other developments including the possibility of another declaration payment three months hence dividends are important to some investors especially those who live on the income they are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends in actual fact dividends are one component of total or overall return the other component is capital gains and the sum of the two represents your return

there is a difference between an owner and a signer an owner is the legal owner of the funds a signer has access to withdraw the funds in most cases when a new personal account is opened the name is added as an however that is not always the case a person could be an owner but not a signer in a custodial arrangement for example a minor child may be an owner only on their account with a custodial parent listed as a signer the minor could not withdraw from the account a person could be a signer but not an owner in a business or estate trust account the business or estate would be the owner with individuals listed as signers only the business employees do not own the funds they are only allowed to withdraw and disburse the funds on behalf of the company the creditor can only garnish withhold funds that are owned by the indebted if the second person on the account is only a signer those funds can not be withheld as part of a judgment against the second person they do n't own those funds however simply the second person as a signer only is not sufficient if you share access with the second person and allow them to spend the money for their own benefit they are no longer just a signer they have become an owner because you are sharing your funds with them think of the business relationship as an example the employee is a signer so they can withdraw funds and pay business expenses like the electric bill if the employee withdrew funds and bought herself a new dress she is stealing because she does not own those funds if the second person on the account buys things for themselves or transfers some of the money into their own account they are demonstrating that more than a signer only relationship exists a true signer only relationship is where the individual can only withdraw funds on the owner 's behalf for example the owner is out of town and needs a bill paid the signer can write a check and pay the bill for the owner a limited power of attorney may be worth looking into with a limited poa the owner can define the scope and expiration of the power of attorney with this arrangement the second person becomes an executor of the owner under certain circumstances for example you could write a power of attorney that states something like john smith is hereby granted the limited power to withdraw funds from account on deposit at bank for the purpose of paying debts and obligations and otherwise maintain my estate in the event of my or inability to attend to my own affairs this power of attorney shall expire on it 's fifth anniversary unless renewed if the person you have granted the power of attorney abuses their access you could sue them and you would only have to demonstrate that they the scope of their power

in the us dividends are presently taxed at the same rates as capital gains however selling stock could lead to less tax owed for the same amount of cash raised because you are getting a return of basis or can elect to engage in a loss harvesting strategy   so to reply to the title question specifically there are more tax benefits to selling stock to raise income versus receiving dividends   you have precise control of the realization of gains     however the reason dividends or dividend funds are used for retirement income is for matching cash flow to expenses and preventing a liquidity crunch   one feature of retirement is that you 're not working to earn a salary yet you still have daily living expenses    dividends are stable and more predictable than capital gains and generate cash generally quarterly   while companies can reduce or suspend their dividend you can generally budget for your portfolio to put a reliable amount of cash in your pocket on schedule   if you rely on selling shares quarterly for retirement living expenses what would you have done or how much of the total position would you have needed to sell in order to eat during a decline in the market such as in 2007 2008

withdraw in cash bank reports it to irs no matter what would this    affect my tax filing in the coming year no and no the bank does n't report to the irs in the us the bank will probably report to fincen it has nothing to do with your tax return withdraw in check bank does not seem to report it is this correct does n't have to still might if they think it is a suspicious irregular activity wire transfer to another person 's account would this always be    slapped with a gift tax if this is a gift it would regardless of how you transfer the money is it answers to your follow up questions in the us what documents do we need to prepare in case our large sum    withdraw from the bank triggers a flag in relevant government local    and/or federal divisions and they decide to investigate depending on what the investigators request fincen would investigate money laundering the irs would investigate tax evasion the fbi would investigate terrorism sponsorship etc depending on who 's investigating and what the suspicions are different documents may be required but the bottom line is that you should be able to explain the source of the funds and the destination for example i found $ 1 m in cash and sent it to some drug lord because he 's such a good friend of mine will probably not fly does the local federal government care if we stash our money in    cash or check under our mattress if we purchase foreign properties    taxable documents needed for proof or if we give it away to    individuals or organizations individual a gift tax organization    tax the government cares about taxes and illegal activities stashing money under a mattress is not illegal but earning cash and not paying income tax on it usually is in many cases money stashed under the mattress was obtained illegally and/or income taxes were not paid it seems that no matter what we do except spreading thin our assets    to multiple accounts in multiple banks the government will always be    notified of any large bank transaction and we would be forever flagged    since is this correct yes reportable transactions will be reported also spreading around in multiple accounts transactions to avoid reporting is called structuring and is on its own a crime this is for cash cash equivalent transactions only of course not sure about the forever flagged since that part is probably sourced in your imagination

first to answer the question   the benefit of a 401k is that you do n't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates   you get that with the restriction that you ca n't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account and you are taxed on withdrawals more severely if you do it before you are 65   similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits   now for the 7000 not providing benefit   assuming a very modest 4 growth over 40 years 7000 becomes not something to sneeze at inflation risk reward blah blah blah it is less than it looks but 4 is really pretty low the stock market averages anywhere from and iirc the bond market is somewhere around 5   now certainly to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw   however if it is possible you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account   the penalties and lost earning opportunities are pretty significant   /u has the r finance for how much you lose by doing an early withdraw   do n't do this lightly and i would suggest avoiding cashing out the whole thing if you can

think of options as insurance an insurance company makes money by selling the policies at a rate slightly higher than the average payout   most options expire worthless this is because most options are purchased by hedge funds to hedge means taking out insurance in case your position goes against you so the sellers of options obtain a price that covers their averaged losses plus provides them with a profit for their trouble   an option has an amount that it declines in value each day called theta at the expiration date the option is worth zero if it is out of the money so it is option writers that typically make money in the options market as they are the sellers of insurance if they did n't make money selling options they would not sell them   for example the february call option on spy strike 200 traded at on since then it has in value to 0.14 the option writer currently stands to make a huge profit   so just as with insurance you generally never make money by buying insurance but the sellers of insurance tend to make money as do the writers of options   edit theta investopedia

if you are to company 's financial reports and offerings the required source for companies to disclose the information is the website under the company disclosure tab   this includes annual statements for the last 5 years prospectus for any shares debentures buy back etc which is being offered ipo offers and shareholders meetings you may also find it useful to check the research section of the website where some of the public listed companies have voluntarily allowed independent research firms to monitor their company for a couple of years and produce a research report if you are referring to filings under the companies act these can be found at the accounting and regulatory authority website and you can also purchase of specific filings under the to understand the singapore public listing system and the steps to public listing you may find it useful to purchase one of the resource documents available for singapore law finance tax and corporate which are sold by specifically for public listing the singapore listing manual may help   it is common practice for companies here to employ law firms and research firms to do the majority of this research instead of doing it themselves which i one of the reasons this information is online but perhaps not so visible i hope i have understood your question correctly

no but you can better see who is making that profit possible   i 've worked for companies where some divisions were making a profit according to their books but when you take into account the resources they were consuming especially it they were really operating at a loss   in the case of it i do n't think its beneficial to make a profit but they should at least charge the other departments their cost just so you can see how those other departments are impacting the company as a whole

p e is price divided by earnings per share eps p e ttm is price divided by the actual eps earned over the previous 12 months hence trailing twelve month in forward p e is the e is the average of analyst expectations for the next year in eps now as to what 's being displayed yahoo shows eps to be 1.34 = p e of google shows eps to be = p e of prices as displayed respectively so by the info that they are themselves displaying it 's google not yahoo that 's displaying the wrong p e. note that the p e it is showing is a decimal from 580 note that cnbc shows the earnings as as well and correctly show the p e as 580 a quick use of a currency calculator reveals a possible reason why eps is listed differently at yahoo pounds is dollars currently so i think the yahoo eps listing is in dollars a look at the last 4 quarters on cnbc makes that seem reasonable those add up to $ 1.40

the typical down payment was expected to be 20   the idea being that if one could not save of the cost of a house they were not responsible enough to ensure repayment of the loan it is hard to say whether this is truly a relevant measure   however in the absence of other data points it is pretty decent   it typically requires a fair amount of time to amass that much money and it does demonstrate some restraint   e.g. it is easily the cost of a decent new car or some other shiny toy income is not necessarily a good measure on its own   i am certainly more responsible with my spending when i have less money to spend   lately i have been feeling like my father every single purchase down to the penny

first of all not all brokers allow trading during pre market and post market   some brokers only allow trading during the regular hours 4 pm et second of all while you can place orders using limit orders and market orders during regular trading hours you can only use limit orders during pre market and post market   this is because the liquidity is much lower during pre market and post market and using market orders could result in some trades filling at horrible prices   so brokers do n't allow using market orders outside of regular trading hours third some brokers require you to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre market or post market   for example my broker allows me to specify either day or ext for my orders   day means i want my order to execute only during regular trading hours and ext means i want my order to execute at any time pre market regular trading hours or post market finally if your broker allows pre post market trading and you place a limit order while specifying ext then your trade can happen in real time during pre market or post market   per your example if a stock is trading at $ 5 at 8 am and you put in a limit order while specifying ext to buy it at $ 5 at 8 am then your order will execute at that time and you will buy that stock at 8 am

your question is a moving target and my answer will be subject to revision i disagree with the votes to close as you are asking imho what role commodities and specifically oil play in one 's asset allocation right how much may be opinion but there 's a place to ask if   i 'm looking at this chart and thinking long term the real return is zero the discussion regarding gold has been pretty exhausted for oil it 's not tough to make the case that it will fluctuate but long term there 's no compelling reason to believe its price will rise any faster than inflation over the really long term

gt is your time frame any longer than intraday i imagine you would n't want to carry that risk overnight if you 're a broker or selling a route   most brokers these days are executing in an agent capacity so they 're never holding the risk they execute what they can the customer keeps what they ca n't    gt so say for instance you join a bid a few levels down you are n't really get filled you start hitting the offer and eventually you realize you 're competing with someone for the shares offered so you take out the price level and bid on all the exchanges so that you 're first on the bid at that level then repeat until someone that can match your appetite starts to fill you on the bid   lifting the offer hit bids lift offers and i suppose that 's a albeit a somewhat simple one passive routing strategies differ from firm to firm and algo to algo what is your customer going to think if you bid up a new price level only for the stock to rally completely away from it   gt right so say you need 100k shares there are 10k offered at 9.98 25k offered at 9.99 and 65k at 10.00 you might just enter an sweep order of 100k 10 limit and hope that you can get most of the shares off before everyone can cancel i imagine there has to be a lot of bidding it up to attract sellers and then letting people take out your bids all day   bidding it up to attract sellers sounds an awful lot like wiki just a heads up sure though if you want to tighten a spread or create new levels with aggressive passive liquidity that is a strategy the same caveats as i mentioned above apply   anyway if market impact is n't an issue for the customer sure take liquidity until you 're filled do n't forget about getting good size done in the opening and closing auctions moc if you 're too passive you risk the market moving away from you and pissing off the customer if you 're too aggressive you risk moving the market too much and pissing off the customer

it sounds like maybe you want an investment club   as defined by the sec an investment club is a group of people who pool their money to make investments usually investment clubs are organized as partnerships and after the members study different investments the group decides to buy or sell based on a majority vote of the members club meetings may be educational and each member may actively participate in investment decisions these typically do not need to register investment clubs usually do not have to register or register the offer and sale of their own membership interests with the sec but since each investment club is unique each club should decide if it needs to register and comply with securities laws there 's more information from the sec here the taxes depend on how you organized the club i.e. if you organize as a partnership i believe that you will be taxed as a partnership not 100 sure   some online brokerages have special accounts specifically for investment clubs   check around

break the transactions into parts go to your bank or credit union and get a loan commitment when applying for loan get the maximum amount they will let you borrow assuming that you will no longer own the first car take the car to a dealer and get a written estimate for selling the car pick one that gives you an estimate that is good for a week or ten days you now know a data point for the trade in value finally go to the dealer where you will buy the replacement car negotiate the price tell them you do n't need financing and you will not be trading in the car get all you can regarding rebates and other special incentives once you have a solid in writing commitment then ask about financing and trade in if they beat the numbers you have regarding interest rate and trade in value accept those parts of the deal but do n't let them change anything else if you keep the bank financing the dealer will usually give you a couple of days to get a check   if you decide to the car to the first dealer do so as soon as you pick up the replacement car if you try to start with the dealer you are buying the car from they will keep adjusting the rate length of loan trade in value and price until you have no idea if you are getting a good deal

yes eligibility for contributing to a roth ira is determined by your modified adjusted gross income magi which is based on your adjusted gross income agi now agi includes the net capital gains from your transactions and magi adds back in things that were subtracted off e.g. tuition deductions foreign earned income exclusion in arriving at the agi there is a worksheet in publication 590 that has the details you are always entitled to contribute to a traditional ira the magi affects how much of your contribution is tax deductible on that year 's tax return but not your eligibility to contribute   both the above paragraphs assume that you have enough compensation wages salary self employment income to contribute to an ira the contribution limit is $ 5500 or total compensation whichever is smaller if you earned only $ 2 k as wages you can contribute all of it not just your take home pay which is what is left after social security and medicare taxes federal taxes etc have been withheld from that $ 2 k if your entire income is from capital gains and stock dividends you can not contribute to any kind of ira at all

is this a reasonable goal or will it be impossible to get a loan with    my almost non existent income i know i can put estimated rental revenue as income but i 'm not sure    if i would qualify banks typically only count rental income after you 've been collecting it for two years and at that point the banks will count 75 of it as income for loan qualification purposes   you 'd have to qualify for the mortgage without the potential rental income currently that means a 43 debt including proposed mortgage to gross income ratio even if you qualify you have to be prepared to handle repairs hvac water heater could fail on day 1 and tenants have a right to withhold rent if some repairs are n't made you also have to be able to weather non payment eviction of a tenant you could find a co maybe go in on a house with a friend but there are risks and complications that can arise there if a party becomes unable to pay or deciding how to split equity and expenses   if you had the income capital to comfortably pull it off without tenants then that 'd be a great situation college rentals tend to be lucrative i 'd recommend getting tenants with parental co signers to reduce risk if you qualify but would be in trouble quickly if one tenant stopped paying or a major appliance needed to be replaced then it 's probably not worth the risk

the market moves faster than ratings agencies   everyday the market is trying to figure out the true value of assets liabilities and thus its overall equity value   the financial crisis illustrated this perfectly when bear got stuck in a liquidity trap   it 's was still highly rated likewise its overall credit rating was sound however in reality the value of assets were much higher due to coming default credit providers realized assets bear had posted as collateral were falling in value quickly   this started the death spiral or feedback loop in which it is n't clear if the tail the dog or the dog the tail but as equity value fell bear could no longer get access to credit markets to fund daily operations once it got margin called and could n't pay it was all over   when it was sold to jpm they basically stole the entire company at a fire sale price everyone knew they were getting a deal as reflected in the post buyout price jump of jpm stock     so in a technical sense you are right they have nothing to do with each other   but in a practical sense as we see equity value collapse we are approaching bankruptcy and thus default and credit ratings should represent likelihood of default so the two should have a positive correlation to one another assuming equity value is the true value

expensing a transfer of funds is incorrect that will affect the profit loss income statement when you transfer it out and back in which you do not want at least for the principle the interest should be recorded as a interest income the general way to account for transferring money is to credit the originating account and debit the destination account this will only affect the balance sheet accounts for example transferring buying 10,000 worth of fix term bank deposits interest is paid the bank deposit reaches maturity so the principle is returned with the final interest payment the accounts checking account and fixed term bank deposit are asset accounts which show up on the balance sheet the interest income is an income account which will show up in the income statement this is how a fixed term cd is usually recorded in certain cases where the business must follow an accounting standard this may very well be insufficient but this situation will be unlikely if it 's a small private sports club having said that double check to make sure what you 've stated is indeed correct and look back into the past entries to see how it was dealt with before especially since you said this bookkeeping job is temporary i would strongly advise against changing non recent entries even if they are incorrect for the insurance payments that would depend on how the damaged assets were accounted for it 's a little hard to say without more the extent of the damage how the diminished value was accounted for in the books the cost of repair materials etc

you are smart to read books to better inform yourself of the investment process   i recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books if you still feel like you can generate after tax after expenses alpha returns in excess of the market returns take a shot at some active investing   if you actively invest i recommend the core satellite approach invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account   carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns to truly understand a text like the intelligent investor you need to understand finance and accounting   for example the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise total shares outstanding times price per share divided by the earnings of the business   at a high level earnings are just revenue less cogs less operating expenses less taxes and interest   earnings depend on a company 's revenue recognition inventory accounting methods fifo lifo purchase price allocations from acquisitions etc   if you do n't have a business degree business background i do n't think books are going to provide you with the requisite knowledge unless you have the discipline to read textbooks   i learned these concepts by completing the chartered financial analyst program

the crazy thing about this is that $ 30 million in annual salary and compensation really is n't the end of the story for rich guys   i worked for a reit a few years back and the guy that founded that reit made a few million in salary a year   i thought the number seemed a bit low for his lifestyle   he had many properties in the us for his own personal use around 6 8 big homes   he also had a garage that was insane   he had over 25 very expensive cars   my co workers would say nick is out his garage when he drove one to work every day for a month without driving the same vehicle twice in one month   it turns out he owned 30 million shares of stock that paid him $ 1.00 per share per year   so while his annual compensation was only a few million per year his dividend income was many many times that   think about that next time you see a ceo 's annual income and you think that it really is n't as much as you expect

this will work as intended but there 's another point to consider in the us the tax rate on proceeds from stock sales is higher for short term holdings which are defined as held for less than one year both rates vary based on your income bracket numbers are for fiscal year 2014 filing as single the difference between short and long term capital gains tax in the us is a minimum of ten percentage points and works out to 15 percentage points on average this is substantial if you wo n't be reporting much income the year you move to the us say because you only worked for a portion of the year it is decidedly to your advantage to wait and sell the stocks in the us to get that sweet 0 rate at a minimum you should hold the position for a year if you sell and rebuy from a tax optimization perspective two caveats

which way would save the most money paying of the car today would save the most money   would you borrow money at 20 to put it in a savings account   that 's effectively what she is doing by not paying off the car if it were me i would pay off the car today and add the car payment to my savings account each month   if the car payment is $ 400 that 's $ 1,500 a month that can be saved and the $ 12k will be back in 8 months that said remember that this is your girlfriend not a spouse   you are not in control or responsible for her finances i would not tell her that she should do this only explain it to her in different ways and offer advice as to what you would do   look together at how much has been paid in principal and interest so far how much she 's paying in interest each month now and how much she 'll pay for the car over the life of the loan   i would also encourage her not to buy cars with a loan which i 'm guessing is how she got here in the end though it 's her decision

you could but the bank wo n't let you if you 're a sole proprietor then you could probably open a personal account and just use it and never tell them that is actually a business however depending on your volume of operations they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions for corporations you can not use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds also you 're generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection which is why you have the corporation to begin with generally business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts and it costs more for the banks to run them in the us some banks offer free or very low cost business accounts for small businesses that do n't need too many transactions i 'm sure if you shop around you 'll find those in canada as well

imho the best scenario where greece does not leave the euro in this scenario there is probably no risk because either the ecb will print more money or other countries will help greece in some way the average scenario where greece leaves the euro all bank accounts will be frozen and slowly turned into new drachma and your poor money after the conversion will be worth 50 k euro at best but probably much less there is also the worst scenario the bank defaults too and you will lose everything italy has a fund to protect deposits up to 100 k euro i do n't know if you have something similar in greece however a similar fund in greece would be guaranteed by greek banks and the greek government so you might not get much back regardless

wikipedia talks about the chinese currency scholarly studies suggest that the yuan is undervalued on the basis of purchasing power parity analysis so despite it appearing cheaper due to the official exchange rate the price in china might actually be fair there are also restrictions on foreign exchange purportedly to prevent inflows of hot money which in concert with any other legal obstacles to owning or trading on the chinese exchange may also explain why the high frequency traders are n't tripping over each other to arbitrage away the difference

one interesting part of this history that is often forgotten was how absolutely close we came to a universal basic income under nixon fap went through the democratic dominated house without much trouble in late 1970 it carried a very decisive margin absent a of rather unique circumstances in 1970 high among them the cambodian campaign for a host of reasons that created a chill between nixon and the senate from which their relations would never truly recover it is not at all hard to imagine it being passed    one wonders how welfare policy would have developed with that keep in mind fap was meant to help both the working poor and working class as well as really more than the underclass which was part of how knew how to appeal to nixon    other factors in fap 's downfall include   1 the of the finance committees these things often were passed down by generation by strongly conservative southern democrats whose states being largely still the poorest the new south was only getting started would have disproportionately effected by fap largely against their own political interests unlike the great society fap would have given recipients direct cash payouts and would have largely gone over their heads so to speak and after the cambodian campaign nixon could ill afford to alienate them    2 nixon 's shift in attention in the summer of 1970 to other areas prominent among them national security and foreign policy for the former the violently illegal to the point where j. edgar hoover no shrinking when it came to treating the civil rights of certain us citizens with some flexibility objected plan would be created in the summer of 70 as for the latter this was when the china initiative was just beginning to take off and getting into high gear following the destruction of the absent both of these nixon would have his hands full at any rate that autumn with the dual crisis of the black september and right at the moment fap was in its death in front of the aforementioned finance committees   nixon would take a subsequent conservative turn for the 1970 elections following a very strategy with little to no success which shaped his 1972 strategy    3 the strong resistance of the senate gop to the measure especially in the wake of the great society some libertarians did support the fap but intended it to replace the welfare state as opposed to nixon wishing to supplement it it into something more fiscally feasible the gop were strongly resistant in general to nixon 's attempts to transform the gop into something they fundamentally did n't wish to be    the ultimate of this was had nixon had his way his vp and eventual successor would have been john former texas governor and 's de facto right hand man top fixer who the kind of conservative democrat that nixon wanted to transform the gop with into what would have essentially been a style party this was not the same vision the people who dominated the gop at the local level had in mind to say the least and was a contributing factor into why nixon did n't invest a lot of energy into for the gop during the 72 and why the party returned the favor during    4 the resistance of a lot of senate liberals to anything that would have given nixon a domestic success especially after cambodia and before the 70 merely the clinton wars in reverse in a sense clinton 's strategy in 1995 after the democratic slaughter in the of 1994 was ironically off of nixon 's in 1971 following the disappointing results of the 1970 for the gop   the fap would be attempted again twice but it never really had the same chance of passing that it did the first time as for cheney and i 'm not terribly shocked both of them belong to the heavily influenced wing of the party that historically has n't had much attachment to small government style thinking found in the congressional part of the gop they both have a knack for thinking politically too cheney defended bush senior 's decision to not boot the out of in the early 90s when few in the gop were the next decade would dramatically change things as the dominant foreign policy ideology of the part transformed to the ideology of democratic that came over to the basement in the reagan years and in 92 against bush the who along with the old style nixon realist foreign policy school of the party cheney knew where his bread was and where the winds were going   was also a dove on vietnam by 71 believe it or not to the point where it somewhat alienated nixon and eventually incurred the of hr a very unwise move in the nixon white house to the point where he got kicked upstairs to a post in brussels dealing with nato the reason i emphasized normally is because this let escape completely unscathed had that not happened there 's no way he 'd have had the clout to pull off the halloween in 75 at that age

i somewhat agree to alex b 's post   i was a finance manager for 7 years both prime and sub other words bad    the parts he 's 100 right on   hit up you local credit union then your bank   get your financing done first if you can   now 690 credit score is one of 3 bureaus not all banks and lending institutions use all three or the same one   also the score is n't everything   that could be good or bad   the 2 3 range is normally for the 720 + crowd unless its a manufacture   gm ford so on   with rates capping out at around 30 depending on state laws   however 690 should not be 19 on a new or late model car   at 690 at 19 you would have be going for a 70,000 + mile 6 year or older car if i had to guess assuming you have no bk 's and    some times dealerships have to pay banks to get people financed   its hidden in the cost and they by law are not allowed to tell you about it because it can not be passed on to you   however the banks do n't just fund any crazy amount of money either say like 115 of book and   that it   that is where and why they want that big down payment because that is used to off set the finance amount and what you pay   making the dealership money   and i can go on and on and on    but you should always try to get the funding prior   your credit union wo n't charge the hidden fees and they only care about your down payment to see that you are making a commitment   if you are buying used   save out 1500 for future repairs and tires and such   do n't buy paint and such   if you finance thru the dealership and put less than 20 down do buy gap insurance but that s it   i can go on and on but i wo n't   feel free to ask though    and to answer your original only question with not context is there any reason not to put a 35 down payment on a car yes if the money is better served paying off credit cards or long term mortgage assuming you do n't need the write off

assuming that partial payments are held without interest until enough money has accumulated to make at least a full payment and assuming that overpayments are applied toward principal a strategy of making three $   payments per month will shorten your amortization period by less than one month   these calculations assume that the interest rate is 12.5 percent apr compounded monthly with an apy of percent instead of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   you would make the equivalent of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   if you make one $   payment every ten days you will make an average of partial payments per year instead of 36 partial payments per year   this will speed up your loan amortization by about another month and a half over the course of the 72 month loan   one month of shortening is due to the extra principal payments and the other half month is due to interest savings    to a second approximation this strategy is similar to paying $   per month for 69 months plus a final payment of $     in other words this strategy will probably involve about payments of $   each possibly with a small payment

if you have an actual legal entity legal partnership that is jointly owned by you and your partner then the partnership receives the money and the partnership then sends money to you and your partner each of you will pay tax on your share it 's possible that the partnership itself may have to pay taxes if you are not following that procedure in terms of actual money flow for example if the royalties are paid into your personal account instead of a partnership account then you may have trouble convincing the tax authorities that this is the legal situation if this is a small amount of money then you may be better off just paying the taxes

i agree with the comments so far access does n't equal ownership there are also different levels of access e.g. your financial advisor can have access to your retirement account via power of attorney but only ability to add or change things not withdraw another consideration is when a creditor tries to garnish wages bank accounts it needs to find the accounts first this could be done by running a credit report via ssn my guess is an account with access only rights wo n't show up on such a report i suppose the court could subpoena bank information but i 'm not an attorney so please check with a professional

for stocks i would not see these as profiting at the expense of another individual   when you purchase trade stocks you are exchanging items of equal market value at the time of the trade both parties are getting a fair exchange when the transaction happens if you buy a house the seller has not profited at your expense you have exchanged goods at market prices if your house plummets in value and you lose $ 100k it is not the sellers fault that you made the decision to purchase the price was fair when you exchanged the goods future prices are speculative so both parties must perform due diligence to make sure the exchange aligns with their interests   obviously this is barring any sort of dishonesty or insider information on the part of either buyer or seller

that 's true it definitely depends on the temperature   the dew point is the temp at which water or evaporates depending on which way your going on the scale and is dependent on the relative humidity   when relative humidity goes up the dew point goes up   as long as your external body temp skin temp is higher than the dew point the sweat will evaporate   mentioned the heat index being 102 ° f   this would mean you 'd have to get your skin temp higher than 102 ° f which would mean your core temp is even higher dangerously high   this is one of the major advantages of moisture clothing   it removes the sweat from your skin when evaporation is n't good enough and helps cool you faster

you have a loan you can probably assume you 're going to have to repay that loan every dollar and every dollar that 's outstanding on that loan costs you interest so assuming you 're not hit by any pre payment penalty any dollar that you pay down on your house right now saves you a compounded a year where r is your mortgage rate it does n't really matter whether you 're planning to sell it in a few years or not if you pay $ n you 'll save the interest + $ n taken from the sale price and sent to the bank when you sell the house and move though you might get a tax deduction on the interest if you have a better place to park your money and earn a decent rate of return it would be worth it to do that instead of paying down the mortgage if you had another loan with higher interest rates that 's probably a better loan to pay off if you can spend some of all of it on something that 's actually genuinely worth of its purchase price a year plus whatever the wear and tear takes away from its value if anything then spend it on that instead that 'd be a better investment for instance investments in the stock market may offer better returns however that 's risky observe that you ca n't lose money paying down your mortgage and that safety is usually relatively expensive these days so it 's not a bad deal but if you 're talking about using it for long term retirement savings that are tax advantaged to boot that 's another matter if you already have ample emergency funds and were just planning on putting the money into a savings account to rot at taxable interest it 's definitely worth it to pay down your balance now unless you 're about to sell so the savings are slight and it 's a real inconvenience

they should not be able to tell the difference between a regular card and a secured card the issue for a vendor is can they put a lock on the account equal to the transaction you are about to do for a rental car company they do n't have an exact idea of what your charges will be it is based on many options some of which you do n't decide until the day you return the car    because a secured card generally is on the small end max measured in hundreds or at most $ 1,000 they might not be able to put a lock of sufficient size on the card

if commuting is a big budget item then can you a side job is one way to make extra money but i 'd suggest a home business   if your wife substitute teaches i bet she writes fairly well and in any case you can   write a personal finance blog or just a site with articles   focus on surviving and thriving with in a one income christian household in the suburbs of philadelphia   or if you have a hobby that your furnace write about that   heck do both   the content just stays there and gets traffic day after day that you can monetize my main suggestion would be to start this now because it 's not overnight money   but in the long run it can turn into a nice fairly passive income the big advantage of this is that mommy gets to stay home with the kids and build up a decent business   the cost is $ for the domain per domain and maybe $ 10/month for hosting or if some other legitimate work at home business presents itself go with that   i suggest blogging because it 's what i know but everyone 's an expert in something unique

an accountant should be able to advise on the tax consequences of different classes of investments assets debts e.g. rrsp tfsa mortgage but i would not ask an accountant which specific securities to hold in these vehicles or what asset allocation in terms of geography capitalization or class equity vs fixed income vs derivatives vs structured notes etc an investment advisor would be better suited to matching your investments to your risk tolerance

in us public stock markets there is no difference between the actions individual retail traders are permitted to take and the actions institutional corporate traders are permitted to take   the only difference is the cost of those actions   for example if you become a registered market maker on say the bats stock exchange you 'll get some amazing rebates and reduced transaction prices however in order to qualify for registered market maker status you have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes   an individual retail trader is certainly permitted to do that but it 's probably too expensive algorithmic trading is not the same as automated trading algorithmic trading can be non automated and automated trading can be non algorithmic and both can be anywhere from low- to high frequency   a low frequency automated strategy is essentially indistinguishable from a person clicking their mouse several times per day so no from a legal or regulatory perspective there is no special procedure an individual retail trader has to follow before s he can automate a trading strategy   your broker on the other hand may have all sorts of hoops for you to jump through in order to use their automation platform last but certainly not least you will almost certainly lose money hand over fist attempting bid ask scalping as an individual retail trader whether your approach is algorithmic or not automated or not   why   because the only way to succeed at bid ask scalping is to a always be at near the front of the queue when a price change occurs in your favor and b always cancel your resting orders before they are executed when a price change occurs against you   unless your algorithms are smarter than every other algorithm in the industry an individual retail trader operating through a broker 's trading platform can not react quickly enough to succeed at either of those   you would have to eschew the broker and buy direct market access to even have a chance and that 's the point at which you 're no longer a retail trader good luck

the title accepts as fact the attempted smear campaign by goldman against smith   only read the summary of the report over at bloomberg not the report itself but the argument appears to be that smith did not raise these concerns about goldman at any time while employed there except at the very end just after he had written the nyt op ed   goldman is trying to pawn off smith as a disgruntled former employee   however the fact that smith did n't get the raise he sought does not necessarily mean his assertions about the culture at goldman are incorrect   the point being that goldman has not proven smith is a fraud   they have only proven he has an axe to grind

my interpretation of that sentence is that you ca n't do the buying selling of shares outright sans margin because of the massive quantity of shares he 's talking about   so you have to use margin to buy the stocks however because in order to make significant money with this sort of strategy you probably need to be working dozens of stocks at the same time you need to be familiar with portfolio margin   since your broker does not calculate margin calls based on individual stocks but rather on the value of your whole portfolio you should have experience handling margin not just on individual stock movements but also on overall portfolio movements for example if 10 by value of the stocks you 're targeting tend to have a correlation of with the price of oil you should probably target another 10 by value in stocks that tend to have a correlation of + 0.8 with the price of oil   and so on and so forth   that way your portfolio can weather big or even small changes in market conditions that would cause a margin call on a novice investor 's portfolio

after determining your potential savings rate it is important to spend some time considering your retirement goals in particular do you want to live on the same amount of money you live on today maybe more less less if you plan on living on less than today i would maximize pre tax contributions as a first priority ie 401k in doing so you opt to withdraw the money in the future at a lower marginal tax rate if you have other pre tax accounts available such as an hsa i think it makes sense to go this route the same more if you plan on living on the same or more than today then the roth choice becomes a matter of personal preference if you believe taxes will be higher at retirement then today for those in this camp i 've seen recommendations that say roth should be approximately one fifth to one half of annual contributions where possible my suggestion would be to wager on the lower end as most pre tax accounts can be converted to roth in a year when you may be in a lower marginal tax bracket assuming your savings rate is 20 on 100k income the one fifth recommendation would be $ 4000 towards roth and the other $ towards pre tax accounts such as 401k or hsa

var does not capture overall risk it allows you to say a statement based on our model of the time losses will not exceed x.   the problem is    1 how accurate is the statement out of sample   2 what is the marginal value of this number are the choices i make better or worse   3 even with a confidence level what is the cost to the organization if a decision is made when the model is wrong   personally when running multiple strategies you always need to factor in model risk in your asset allocation trading i.e. either shut down or reduce exposure when assumptions are violated or run something else for example when correlations between strategies increases it is logical to downsize exposure to those strategies as the risk factor to equity has increased   1 in the grand context of a bank financial institution if the var is wrong we can bankrupt or negative so we may want to diversify revenue streams by avoiding that risk for example correlations increase across asset classes   2 sizing is a key problem for banks as the question is does model error across various platforms fi eq transactions etc happen at the same time

brendan the short answer is no there is no need to get into any other funds for all intents and purposes the s&p 500 is the stock market the news media may quote the dow when the market reaches new highs or crashes but all of the dow 30 stocks are included in the s&p 500   the s&p is also weighted which means that it owns in higher proportion the big blue chip stocks more than the smaller less known companies to explain the top 10 holdings in the s&p represent 18 of the total index while the bottom 10 only represent 0.17 less than 1 percent they do have an equal weighted s&p in which all 500 companies represent only of the index and that is technically even more diversified but in actuality it makes it more volatile because it has a higher concentration of those smaller less known companies so it will tend to perform better during up markets and worse during down markets as far as diversification into different asset classes or other countries that 's non sense the s&p 500 has companies in it that give you that exposure for example it includes companies that directly benefit from rising oil prices rising gold prices etc known as the energy and materials sector it also includes companies that own malls apartment complexes etc known as the real estate sector and as far as other countries most of the companies in the s&p are multi national companies meaning that they do business over seas in many parts of the world apple and facebook for example sell their products in many different countries so you do n't need to invest any of your money into an emerging market fund or an asia fund because most of our companies are already doing business in those parts of the world likewise you do n't need to specifically invest into a real estate or gold fund   as far as bonds go if you 're in your twenties you have no need for them either why because the s&p 500 also pays you dividends and these dividends grow over time so for example if microsoft increases its dividend payment by 100 over a ten year period all of the shares you buy today at a 2.5 yield will in 10 years have a higher 5 yield a bond on the other hand will never increase its yield over time if it pays out 4 that 's all it will ever pay you want to invest because you want to grow your money and if you want to invest passively the fastest way to do that is through index etfs like the $ spy $ ivv and $ rsp also look into the $ xiv it 's an inverse vix etf it moves 5x faster than the s&p in the same direction if you want to actively trade your money you can grow it even faster by getting into things like options highly volatile penny stocks shorting stocks and futures do n't get involved in fx or currency trading unless it through futures

for a real estate transaction there are multiple stages from the sellers viewpoint from the buyers viewpoint if both parties are comfortable skipping some of the steps the role of the agent can be minimized how will a fair price be determined some realism might be needed to make sure that the loan appraisal will not be a problem will an inspection still be needed what warranty will exist if the a c dies this summer   if you still want help from an agent one should be able to help for far less than the normal commission the seller normally interviews three agents before selecting one do the same in this situation ask how much they would charge for a sale between friends they can complete their task in just a couple of hours if the home inspection comes back relatively clean the transaction should be very easy the paperwork is the biggest hurdle you should jointly identify a local settlement company they will be the ones actually filing the paperwork they have lawyers they will check the county records office for existing liens mortgages and address all the issues they can send the proper paperwork to the existing mortgage companies and arrange for mortgage insurance the cost will be the same regardless of the presence of real estate agents and other lawyers   when they say a lawyer is required it is only because of the paperwork

mostly got it right it basically mean that past performance of a stock or a basket of stocks are not at all useful when trying to predict its future there is no proven correlation between past and future performance if there was such a correlation that was proven or known then investors would quickly exploit this correlation by buying or selling this stock thus the prediction it does n't mean the specific individuals can not predict the future stock market hell if i set up 2 ^ 100 different robots where every robots gives a different series of answers to the 100 questions how will stock x do y days from now for then one of those robots would be perfectly correct the problem is that an outside observer has no way of knowing which of the predictor robots is right to say that stock is memoryless strikes me as not quite right to    the extent that stocks are valued based on earnings much of what we    infer about future earnings relies on past and present earnings to put it another way you have $ 1000 now and need to decide whether to invest in a particular stock or a stock index the memoryless property means that no matter how many earning reports you view by the time you see them the stock price already accounts for them so they 're not useful to you if the earning reports are positive the stock is already too high because people bought it before you did so on average you ca n't use this information to predict the stock 's future performance and are better off investing in an index fund unless you desire extra risk that does n't come with more profitability

when you buy something with your credit card the store pays a fee to the credit card company typically a base fee of 15 to 50 cents plus 2 to 3 of the purchase at least that 's what it was a few years back when i had a tiny business and i wanted to accept credit cards big chain stores pay less because they are buying in bulk and have negotiating power just because you are n't paying interest does n't mean the credit card company is n't making money off of you in fact if you pay your monthly bill promptly they 're probably making more off of you because they 're collecting 2 or 3 for a month or less instead of the 1 to 2 per month that they can charge in interest the only situation i know where you can get money from a credit card company for free is when they offer convenience checks or a balance transfer with no up front fee i get such an offer every now and then i presume the credit card company does that for the same reason that stores give out free samples they hope that if you try the card you 'll continue using it to them it 's a marketing cost no different than the cost of putting an ad on television

well first problem is usually that you are trying to do too much you end up micro managing once a company becomes large enough this is impossible to keep doing at the same level    if you find that you do n't have enough time maybe it 's time to either hire someone new or promote transfer someone you need to trust and give freedom to your employees to do their job in their own way which may or may not be better than yours communicate with each at intervals    a lot of business owners struggle with this because it costs them money and that is wrong it 's cost your company money which is a separate entity than you a piece of property that makes you less money than the week before is still making you money you are not losing money so get that out of your head it 's not your money until you take it out of the business until then that money including profits are the property of the business this is how the law see it by the way    marginally an understaffed store will make a larger percentage of profits from revenue a well staffed store will make more actual profits from more actual revenue because it can handle the business coming into the store better which in turns should lead to more business on a particular day you may see more money in profit from an understaffed store someone calls out let 's say   but trust me when i say that will not continue for very long    on of the biggest challenges new business owners face is they are as in they do n't spend the money they need to this means buying new equipment and hiring and giving raises and promotions so you can handle new business as well let say you are making t shirts or really adding new designs to pre made plain shirts you can only press one at a time which for a while is enough but eventually you are going to need another press so you can do 2 at a time but a lot business owners will somehow expect an employee to produce more with what he has now orders are n't being filed and you are in a panic and possibly angry but guess what you are angry at the employee not the fact you were to stupid to realize that he needs 2 presses to do the job correctly that 's your own fault and you 're blind to it because you feel as if you are working twice as hard than them because of the problem you created and let 's say the problem is different now the press is n't getting hot enough and it take 20 per shirt to get it to stay on correctly and you decide to never fix it then a light goes out then blank then blank and suddenly you realize finally all of this needs to be replaced at the same time i 've seen things like this happen in new and old businesses things work fine for the first 5 years then normal maintenance is forgotten have a depreciation fund ready so it does n't feel like you are spending any money that 's what that fund is for and you put into it from the beginning need a $ 2k equipment i have $ 4k saved for this already it was money intended to be spent on this    but of course some of this is going to depend on the type of business you are running and since you have provided us no details i ca n't give an answer for you because all businesses are different but i feel that these things refusing to give freedom and authority to other employees and refusing to spend money when needed are the biggest pitfalls most business owners fall into

is a high value realtime settlement system across europe and for this to be open on weekends would mean all the banks including central banks in the euro zone work quite a few times to manage intra day liquidity banks borrow from each other hence there is an active of the liquidity by banks the borrowing happens over phone and fax and the lending bank sending a high value transaction that credits the borrowing banks these is the day to day job of treasury group highly paid individuals to manage liquidity now if on weekends the volume is less it does not make sense to keep these people the cost of supporting this for very business gain is not driving to build such systems   on the other hand on retail transactions say cards debit credit atm the value is not high and hence there is no treasury function involved and there is a huge need everything is automated so no issues

one thing you did n't mention is whether the 401(k offers a match if it does this is a slam dunk the $ $ right is $ that will be doubled on deposit it 's typical for the first 5 of one 's salary to capture the match so this is right there   in 15 years you 'll still owe $ but 15 $ is $ in your 401(k even without taking any growth into account the likely value of that 401(k is closer to $ 210 k using 8 over that 15 years at 6 it drops to only $ k but as i stated the value of the match is so great that i 'd jump right on that if you do n't get a match of any kind i need to edit completely rip my answer it into whether you feel that 15 years really 30 the market will exceed the 4 cost of that money odds are it will the worst 15 year period this past century 2000 2014 still had a cagr of 4.2

so here 's the sad truth he might actually be making a return on his investment not because it 's right or because the system works but in all these schemes there are a range of people that actually do make money   in addition to that there is that fact that he believes that he is doing a good thing and is unwilling to discuss it   so if he is making even a tiny return and really believes that he is making a large return or that that large return is just around the bend your never going to convince him otherwise   you have two real options if he will listen go though and look at money in money out if money out is larger then money in your screwed   make sure to point out that he should look at real money in left a bank account and real money out deposited to a bank account again be prepared for the fact that he is actually making money some people in the pyramid will make money it 's just never as much or as many people as they make it out to be   do n't attack the system attack other aspects try and argue liquidity or fdic insurance again not trying to show why the system is bad but why a investment in foo instead may be better if nothing else go with diversify never put all your money in one spot even if it 's a really good spot at least in that case he will have some money left over in the end that said your friend may not go for it may just put on blinders and may just stick finger in ears move to option two respect his wishes and set boundaries ok i hear you you like system x i wo n't bring it up again do me a favor do n't you bring it up again either let 's just leave this with religion and politics if he continues to bring it up then when he does just point out you agreed not to discuss the issue and if he continues to push it rethink your friendship if you both respect one another you should be able to respect each others decisions   if you ca n't then sadly you may need to stop spending time with one another

i find those government checks arguments to be more appealing in theory than in reality    ultimately it comes down to deciding who gets what and who gets to be the    capitalism is far from perfect but it decides who gets what through the individual decentralized choices of everyone again it 's not perfect by any means but it is and everyone makes decisions for themselves not for other people    government action decides who gets what through a highly indirect process of electing politicians and decisions are made by a small group of people who are under practically speaking   very little oversight or control a few people make decisions for everyone else    government action is despite all our desire and efforts to avoid this necessarily subject to the same disparities in influence control as the market it may come in different forms and the consequences may manifest differently often less readily apparent but there is no avoiding the a few people have a lot more control than everyone else problem    governments are more prone to corruption because they trade the intangible currency of power in addition to money    no matter how you go about doing so it 's always easier to counteract a private actor than a government given roughly equivalent levels of influence obviously     i understand the desire for intervention but i think we have a scary tendency to place far too much weight on good intentions and far too little weight on consequences    it 's so easy to think things through in your head i do often and come up with a plan that could obviously work exactly as intended for everyone 's benefit in doing so we forget that people are n't to be guided through life for someone else 's vision or pursuit of utopia or anything else they have lives desires interests plans of their own and theirs are just as valid as yours or mine    the reality is that you and i are probably far more similar than either of us would guess but there are still huge differences what we value what we want to do next year whether we want that promotion or want to get laid off so we can finally start our dream business whether we want money for family vacations or medical bills so many differences that i could n't ever fairly and accurately represent your interests without you actually telling me what they are    that 's just the 2 of us there are 300 million people in the us we ca n't comprehend even really knowing a thousand well enough to genuinely speak on their behalf    in theory big plans make everything better in practice they run into the reality that humans truly are n't and controlling 300 million people and predicting their responses actions is way more difficult than it seems big plans often end up with real people people who are just as deserving of opportunities and rights as everyone else getting really hurt because some guy he does n't know and who does n't know him had an idea and the power to enforce it on everyone    i 'm not saying that all government interference is bad of course and i 'm not saying it should n't happen     government interventions that are straightforward wealth transfers are probably less harmful to people like a tax on the rich to give hefty tax refunds to the poor is more direct and less prone to causing unintentional harm then things like wage manipulations

there 's not usually a point to issuing new stock as a dividend because if you issue new stock it dilutes the existing shareholders by the exact same amount as the dividend so now they have a few more shares great but they 're worth the exact same amount this assumes that all stockholders are equal if there are multiple share classes or people whose rights to a stock are tied to the stock price in some manner options warrants or something then a properly structured stock dividend could serve to enrich one set of shareholders and other rights holders at the expense of another but this is usually illegal if this sort of dividends are popular in china i suspect it is due to some regulatory or tax related circumstances which are not present in the united states markets china is kind of notorious for having unusual capital controls limitations on the exchange of currency and markets which are not very transparent

if i understand what you 're asking i think you 're looking at the relationship wrong   yes when one currency has a higher interest rate relative to another it 's value should theoretically appreciate   for example if the usd interest rate is 10 and the eur is 5 the usd should appreciate in value against the eur   however the parity relationship tells you the price at which an investor would be indifferent to the difference in interest rates   so using the formula for interest rate parity   = f s    and plugging in the interest rates from above and a spot rate of $   =   the 1 year forward rate would have to be $ in order for the investor to be indifferent between holding usd or eur   all this assuming interest rate parity holds   i 'm not big on econ but this is how i understood it when studying for the cfa exam the past few months   so please someone correct me if i 'm wrong

an attempt at a simple answer for the normal investor a normal investor buys stock then later sells that stock this is known as going long as opposed to going short   for the normal investor a stop order of either kind is only used when selling a stop loss sell order or stop sell is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price and you do n't want to suffer more losses   if the stock is at $ 50 you could enter a stop sell at $ 40 which means if the stock ever falls to $ 40 or lower your stock will be sold at whatever price is available e.g. $ 35 a stop loss limit sell order or stop limit sell is the same except you are also saying but do n't sell for less than my limit price   so you can enter a stop limit sell at $ 40 with a limit of $ 39 meaning that if the stock falls to $ 40 you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $ 39 or higher   thus your stock will never be sold at $ 35 or any value below $ 39 but of course if the stock falls fast from $ 40 to $ 35 your limit sell at $ 39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock worth at that moment $ 35 say

the point of what you heard is likely that gold is thought by some to hold its value well when the money market would provide negative interest rates these negative interest rates are a sign of deflation where cash money is worth more in the future than it is today   normally under inflation cash money is worth less in the future than it is today under normal circumstances where inflation exists interest paid by the bank on money held there generally keeps up with inflation + a little bit extra now we are seeing many banks offering interest rates in the negatives which is an acknowledgement of the fact that money will be worth more in the future than it is today so in that sense holding physical gold fights deflation or negative interest rates in the same way that holding physical cash does because if you hold onto a $ 10k bundle of bills in 10 years you can walk into a bank and it will be worth $ 10k in future dollars which in a deflationary market would be more than it is worth today some view gold as being better at doing this than just holding cash but that discussion gets into an analysis of the value of paper money as a currency which is outside the scope of this answer   suffice to say i do not personally like the idea of buying gold as an investment but some do and partly for this reason

first of all congratulations on your home purchase   the more equity you build in your house the more of the sale price you get out of it when you move to your next house   this will enable you to consume more house in the future   think of it as making early payments towards your next down payment another option is to save up a chunk of money and your mortgage paying down the principal and having the resulting amount re amortized to provide you with a lower monthly payment   you may be able to do this at least once during your time in the house and if you do it early enough it can potentially help your savings in other areas on the other hand it is possible given today 's low interest rates for mortgages that in other forms of investments such as index funds you could make more on the money you 'd be putting towards your extra payments   then you would have more money in savings when you go to sell this house and buy the next one that you would in equity if you did n't go that route   this is riskier than building equity in your home but potentially has a bigger pay off you do the trade offs

this is just pure capitalistic evil   ok i think i spoke too soon   there are caps on how much you pay back 2 1/2 times principal and the royalty is n't for your whole life but a specific period   perhaps not evil but i do n't think it 's a great investment   unless you plan on working for a non profit

no they invest in growth so immensely that they eat up all their profits when you hear about amazon buying their own planes and starting their own delivery and drones and buying whole foods etc all of those things cost money money that amazon is making but they are spending almost all of it therefore showing little profit for years investors did n’t understand bezos style and they expected earlier returns and year after year he did n’t deliver but year after year the company grew and so did its revenue not a ton has changed although they are more profitable today for sure

typically you diversify a portfolio to reduce risk the s&p 500 is a collection of large cap stocks a diversified portfolio today probably contains a mix of large cap small cap bonds   international equity and cash right now if you have a bond component that part of your portfolio is n't performing as well the idea of diversification is that you smooth out the ups and downs of the market and come out ahead in most situations if you do n't have a bond or cash component in your portfolio you may have picked or had someone pick for you lousy funds   without more detail that 's about all that can be said edit you provided more detail so i want to add a little to my answer basically you 're in a fund that has high fees annually and performance that trails the mid cap index the s&p 500 is a large cap index large cap = = large company so a direct comparison is not necessarily meaningful since you seem to be new at this i 'd recommend starting out with the vanguard total stock market index fund vtsmx or etf vti this is a nice option because it represents the entire stock market and is cheap it 's a good way to get started without knowing alot if your broker charges a transaction fee to purchase vanguard funds and you do n't want to change brokers or pay etf commissions look for or ask about transaction fee free broad market indexes the expense ratio should be below 0.50 per year and optimally under 0.20 if you 're not having luck finding investment options to a discount broker like td ameritrade schwab or fidelity in no particular order

it requires fairly large levels of capital but what about seed funding angel investments in startups this would be before venture capital gets involved so the amounts are relatively low tens of thousands vs. millions of usd but as valuations this early in the game are also low you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market paul graham of y has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you it 's definitely very high risk but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up get some equity help them succeed and they eventually go public or get acquired you can stand to bring in some big returns note that this is n't a hands off investment you 'll need to build connections in the startup community and it is n't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day to day operations of the businesses in which they invest

the article ends saying steve 's success was not attributed to him being an asshole but i think it did   steve figured out how to tap into a human desire that ~30 of the market who can afford and is in the market for an iphone has the desire to be smug and have the new and greatest he marketed that to the predisposed asshole types   now do n't down vote me yet hear me out i am not saying all iphone users are in this category but   using men as a sample here we like toys and having the best toy out of your peers is something of a status symbol think back in the days of old when having a sword or weapon was the normal thing to carry around the man with the most elaborate or bigger or advanced weapon was and could use it to brag   now a days there are a lot more beta males yes i am taking it there than in the rugged past due to institutions like police and insurance allowing for these men to get mates and pass along their genes this allows for the of dick measuring rituals via possessions rather than actions look around at all your iphone owners how tough are they really how often do they complain about trivial shit that does nt matter or do nothing about it how often do they say check out this cool new in reality useless app i have    this is the personality that steve cornered and marketed to   as for women women like to have the newest and things as well for a different reason they use it to show off their desirability to other women in the big race that women run women only care about what other women think of them they care about men in the sense that they can brag to other women how many men are after giving them status among their peers the iphone is marketed like jewelry to women an accessory that them like and a purse   and for all the people who say they like it for the usefulness and such okay you are truly 10 the 100 of his market that is the excuse apple can use as the conscious part of the advertising and the few people that use it for those reason make the vast minority because realistically an android and a bb can do many things and some better than the for way less   if you 'd like to know i used to own a bb was going to get an iphone but wanted to disconnect from the google everything that comes up in conversation email always on facebook always on so i got a pos phone that i do nt worry about dropping getting wet etc
