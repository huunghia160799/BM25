are things getting better yet or are things still a mess i have heard people say that right now is a good time to take out a    loan and that it is a buyer 's market in real estate something to consider here is what intentions do you have for the real estate you 'd buy   if you intend to sell quickly then selling into a buyer 's market does n't sound like a great idea   while real estate may be cheap there can be the question of how long do you think this will last   how much of a burden on time and energy are you expecting to take if you do switch residences or buy an investment property but more specifically are there any hidden details that come with    taking a loan out when interest rates are low that i should be aware    of i 'd be careful to note if the rate is fixed for the entire length of the loan or does it adjust over time   if it can adjust then there is the possibility of those adjustments going up

the logic the interest rate on the mortgage was so low it did n't make sense not to buy is one reason the housing bubble happened the logic was that it made the house affordable even at high prices once the prices collapsed people still had affordable payments but were unable to sell because they were upside down on the mortgage if you can refinance to a 15-year mortgage or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage it can make sense you can save on the monthly payment and on the total cost of the mortgage but do n't buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity these can be false economies or things that ca n't be of course if nobody spends money the economy will stay poor as to hidden details only purchase housing you want to own for the long haul if you expect to flip it in a few years you might not be able to you might end up stuck as a long distance landlord

you are not the economy the economy is just the aggregate of what is going on with everyone else you should make the decision based on your own situation now and projected into the future as best you can loan rates are at historical lows so it is a great time to take a loan if you actually need one for some reason however i would n't go looking for a loan just because the rates are low for the same reason it does n't make sense to buy maternity clothes if you are a single guy just because they are on sale

i think it 's smart it 's the same game just regulations so your lender will ask more from you buy if you if someone has been saving for years and years and still ca n't put 20 down i think they 're taking a significant risk buy something where your mortgage payment is around one week 's salary at most try to buy only what you can afford to live in if you lost your job and could n't find work for 3 6 months you might want to do a fixed instead of a if you 're worried about cash flow

but i ca n't help but feel that these low rates are somehow a gimmick    to trick people into taking out loans let me help you it 's not a feeling that 's exactly what it is since the economy is down people do n't want to jeopardize what they have and keep the cash in their wallets but while keeping the money safe in the pocket it makes the economy even worse so in order to make people spend some money the rates go down so that the cost of money is lower it also means that the inflation will be on the rise which is again a reason not to keep money uninvested so yes the rates are now very low and the housing market is a buyers market so it does make sense to take out a loan at this time provided of course that you can actually repay it over time and do n't take loans you ca n't handle of course you should n't be taking loans just because the rates are low but if you were already planning on purchasing a house now would be a good time to go on with that
# 511515
yes it 's a buyer 's market if one is looking to buy a house comparing the cost to rent vs own is a start buying a property to rent to a stranger is a different issue altogether it 's a business like any other it takes time and has risk   if today one has a decent downpayment 20 and plans to stay in the house for some time buying may make economic sense but it 's never a no brainer one needs to understand that housing can go down as well as up and also understand all the expenses of owning which are n't so obvious ever increasing property tax repairs etc
# 52735
so this is a loan for a house a loan on a house a new mortgage you should n't just get a loan for the hell of it any time interests rates are low because the yields on us treasuries have been pushed closer to zero and that s pretty much that the risk is on the bank that approves the loan and not you your ability to repay should be truthful but your payments are smaller because the interest is so low

in general if you can afford to replace something you are able to self insure   you really want to understand a little of the statistics before you can make a generic call but my rule of thumb is that insurance via extended warranty is rarely a good deal   here is a simple expected value math formula you can apply when the > is true then you should buy it replacement cost x likelihood of using warranty > cost of insurance you can then back compute what is the likelihood that i 'd need to lose this item to break even   given your numbers $ 2000 x y > $ 350 or y > or y > 17.5 so if you think there is a 17.5 or greater chance that you 'll need to have you system replaced i.e. not just a simple fix and as scott pointed out you 'll be able to actually use the replacement warranty then the applecare is a good purchase   note this only applies to items you can replace out of pocket without significant burden because if you did n't have the $ 10k to replace your car it would n't matter if the insurance was n't such a good deal especially if you need the car to get to work etc so the obvious question is why would a for profit company ever offer insurance on something they are statistically likely to lose money on   the obvious answer is they would n't but that does n't mean you should never buy this type of insurance because you may have statistically significant circumstances for instance i purchased a $ 40 remote helicopter as a gift for my children   i also paid the $ 5 for a no questions asked warranty on it because knowing my kids i knew there was a nearly 100 chance they would break it at least once   in this case this warranty was well worth the $ 5 because they did break it   presumably they make money on these warranties because most of the purchasers of the plan are more attentive or too lazy to make the claim than in this case edit note i incorporated scott 's comment about likelihood of being able to utilize the warranty into a combined likelihood of using warranty term   this term could be broken up into likelihood of needing replacement x likelihood of actually getting company to replace it i did n't do this above because it makes it a little harder to understand and may not be a major factor in all cases but you can definitely add it after the fact i.e. if there 's only a 90 chance applecare will pay out at all then divide the 17.5 by 0.9 to get likelihood of needing the replacement for it to be cost effective more complete formulas can be derived also including terms for full replacement costs vs repair costs and including terms for deductible type costs or shipping but i 'm trying to keep things relatively simple for those who are n't statistics nerds like i am

the general argument put forward by gold lovers is n't that you get the same gold per dollar or dollars per ounce of gold but that you get the same consumable product per ounce of gold in other words the claim is that the inflation adjusted price of gold is more or less constant see link for a chart of gold in 2010 gbp all the way from in 2010 gbp means its an inflation adjusted chart as you can see there is plenty of fluctuation in there but it just so happens that gold is worth about the same now as it was in see link for a series of anecdotes of the buying power of gold and silver going back some 3000 years what this means to you if you think the stock market is volatile and want to de risk your holdings for the next 2 years gold is just as risky if you want to invest some wealth such that it will be worth more in real terms when you take it out in 40 years time than today the stock market has historically given better returns than gold if you want to put money aside and it to not lose value for a few hundred years then gold might be a sensible place to store your wealth as per comment from it might be possible to use gold as a partial hedge against the stock market as the two supposedly have very low correlation

some things you should consider from your observations   1 those few units available to rent at the mall they 're available for a reason namely nobody else thinks they have a business idea that can work out at that location malls are suffering all over the country and the more empty units there are at a mall the less people want to go there   2 you are right to be concerned about copyright trademark from amateur etsy creators but there 's another serious problem what do you do with the leftover inventory when harry potter is less cool or the particular etsy product does n't sell as much as you expect are you are taking all the risk   the gamestop in my area is already selling pop barnes and noble does too lots of places if an etsy creator is able to provide their product in volume they are going to want to deal with an established distributor retailer why would they go with some unknown startup single location retailer   now do n't get me wrong you see these kind of idiosyncratic kinds of retailers all over the place selling cards and comic books and other random but it is n't a sure thing and i suspect even the successful ones are not making their owners much of a profit but if it is fun and keeps you busy and gives you enough money to live and save a bit for the future that 's good enough

simple answer yes   a better question to ask might be should i invest all my savings to buy 4 shares of a single stock my answer to that would be probably not if this is your first venture into the world of owning publicly traded companies then you 're better off starting with some sort of mutual fund or etf this will start your portfolio with some amount of diversification so you do n't have all your eggs in one basket if you really want to get into the world of picking individual stocks a good rule of thumb to follow is to invest $ 1 in some sort of indexed fund for every $ 1 you invest in an individual stock this gives you some diversification while still enabling you to scratch that itch of owning a part of apple or whatever other company you think is going in the right direction

if you 're talking about just theta the amount of decay due to the passage of time all else being equal then theoretically the time value is a continuous function so it would decay throughout the day although by the day of expiry the time value is very very small   which makes sense since even with 15 minutes to go there 's still a 50/50 shot of an atm option expiring in the money so there should be some time value associated with that one sided probability the further away from atm the option is the smaller the time value will be and will be virtually zero for options that are deep in- or out of the money if you 're talking about total time value then yes it will definitely change during the day since the underlying components volatility underlying price etc change more or less continuously

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets the major reason for the market is the uncertainty regarding the us dollar if the us credit rating drops that will have an inflationary effect on the currency as it will push up the cost of us treasuries and reduce confidence in the usd if this continues the loss of usd confidence could bring an end to the usd as the world 's reserve currency which could also create inflation as world banks could reduce their usd reserves this can make us assets appear overvalued why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating s&p is a large trusted rating agency so the market will respond to their analysis much like how a bank would respond to any change in your rating by transunion consumer credit bureau does this have any major implications    for the us stock markets today in the    short term and in july if you are a day trader i 'm sure it does there will be minor fluctuations in the market as soon as news comes out either of its extension or any expected delays in passing that extension what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached since the us is in a deficit spending situation it needs to borrow more to satisfy its existing obligations in short it pays its debt with more debt as a result if the debt ceiling is n't raised then eventually the us will be unable to pay its existing obligations we would be in a default situation which could have devastating affects on the value of the usd how hard the hit will depend on how long the default situation lasts the longer we go without an increased ceiling after the exhaustion point the more we default on in reality congress will approve a raise but they will drag it out to the last possible minute they want to appear as if they are against it but they understand the catastrophic effects of not doing so

yes it can buy back the call but much before stock hits the $ 30 mark    let us say you got 1 $ from selling the call so the total money in your account is 4 $ + 1 $ = 5 $ when stock hits 10 $ your strike the maintenance margin is as soon as stock goes past 10 your maintenance margin is violated so broker will buy back your call at least ib does that it does not wait for a margin call now if the stock gapped up from 8 to yes broker will buy it back at 30 so your account will have a negative balance assume the call cost 20 $ when stock hit 30 your balance is 5 30 10 = -15 depending on broker i suppose they will ask you to bring your account balance back up to positive if they do n't do that they risk going out of business

this is an interesting question that may actually be better suited to quant se first of all stock prices are random variables or to be more precise stochastic processes a time ordered string of random variables   the alternative to being stochastic is being deterministic and i doubt you believe that stock prices are deterministic meaning they are fully in advance   the fact that real world events drive the randomness has no bearing on whether or not it is random   so to start i think you have confused the technical definition of random with a concept now the heart of the question is whether stock prices are memoryless   ultimately this is an empirical question that has been addressed in many academic studies   the conclusion of most of this research is that stock prices are almost memoryless in the sense that the distribution of future stock prices displays very little dependence upon past although a few persistent anomalies remain   one of the most robust deviations from is the increase in the volatility of a stock following large declines   another is persistence in volatility   in general in fact the volatility is far more predictable than the mean of stock price changes   hence is a far stronger assumption than the efficient markets hypothesis the bottom line however is that the deviations from are relatively small   as such despite its limitations it is a decent working assumption in some contexts

most biotech companies do not have a product they are selling    they have a set of possible drugs that they are developing      if any of these drugs get proven to be better than the current drugs they can be sold at a great profit therefore as soon as a biotech company proves a drug candidate is likely to pass large scale trials the company is often taken over by a large pharmaceutical company and is therefore no longer listed on the stock market so mostly profit comes after the company stops being listed therefore the profit will be negative for most biotech companies that are publicly traded

a cfd is like a bet do n't own horses or but you still pay them and they pay you if the horses win if you buy a cfd the money goes to the firm you bought it from and if the stock price changes in your favour they will pay you however if it goes against you they may ask you for more money than you originally invested to cover your losses for difference are derivatives i.e. you gain on the change in the price or delta of something rather than on its absolute value someone bets one way and is matched with someone or perhaps more than one betting the other way both parties are bound by the contract to pay or be payed on the outcome one will win and the other will necessarily lose   it 's similar in concept to a spread bet although spread bets often have a fixed timescale whereas cfds do not and cfds generally operate via the payment of a commission rather than via charges included in the spread there 's more information on both cfds and spread betting here if has a lot of cfds that might affect the stock price if it 's known about as others may buy sell real stock to either make the cfd pay or may it not pay depending on whether they think they can make money on it otherwise cfds do n't have much of an effect on stock prices

the answer comes down to what you expect the future tax rate to be if that tax rate is the same 25 marginal here then it is a wash yes you will pay more taxes when you pull the money out with a traditional but it is the same fraction of the original contribution as when you pay the tax now to convert to roth all you did was invest uncle sam 's money well so if you expect to pay higher tax rate on retirement then a roth could be beneficial also a roth does not have a required minimum distribution but congress can change that and it has been proposed the argument for leaving the money in the traditional is that you expect a lower tax rate on retirement or you do n't trust that a future congress wo n't decide to add a nominal tax to roth distributions   now if there is a year where your tax rate is very low then a partial conversion may well be worth it also if you your balance is insufficient for a good portfolio and future contributions will be to a roth due to income limits then that would also be a very good reason to convert

i think the main question is whether the 1.5 quarterly fee is so bad that it warrants losing $ 60,000 immediately suppose they pull it out now so they have 60000 = $ 160,000   they then invest this in a low cost index fund earning say 6 per year on average over 10 years   the result alternatively they leave the $ 220,000 in but tell the manager to invest it in the same index fund now   they earn nothing because the manager 's fees eat up all the gains 4 1.5 = 6 not perfectly accurate due to compounding but close enough since 6 is only an estimate anyway   the result the same $ 220,000 they started with this back of the envelope calculation suggests they will actually come out ahead by biting the bullet and taking the money out   however i would definitely not advise them to take this major step just based on this simple calculation   many other factors are relevant e.g. taxes when selling the existing investment to buy the index fund how much of their savings was this $ 300,000   also i do n't know anything about how investment works in hong kong so there could be some wrinkles that modify or invalidate this simple calculation   but it is a starting point based on what you say here i 'd say they should take the earliest opportunity to tell everyone they know never to work with this investment manager   i would go so far as to say they should look at his credentials e.g. see what kind of financial advisor certification he has if any look up the ethical standards of their issuers and consider filing a complaint   this is not because of the performance of the investments losing 25 of your money due to market swings is a risk you have to accept but because of the exorbitant fees   unless hong kong has got some crazy kind of investment management market charging 1.5 quarterly is highway robbery charging a for withdrawal is   personally i would seriously consider withdrawing the money even if the manager 's investments had outperformed the market

great idea so lets make trader joes in locations where people need living wages like the ghetto because that has been working /s   you make a store that makes a premium selling to the upper middle class and can afford to pay their workers more because of these better margins from their abnormally higher prices it does n't work in areas where cheap food is a necessity these kinds of stores ca n't sell in all economic classes so these stores giving living wages do n't solve any issues we have regarding wage gentrification does n't work so i do n't see why i keep seeing articles talk about trader joes suddenly solving our minimum wage debate if i see a company that rivals walmart in price yet can give a living wage while still being profitable then we have something costco is what comes to mind and to be honest it 's probably the best example we can take from a good business that is able to give a decent wage for unskilled labor while still being profitable the issue is not everyone can afford to spend $ 100 to buy 20 jars of to save 10 cents a jar to rival walmart 's savings

generally cashiers checks do not expire since they are like cash and fully funded at the time of issue however whether they can be cashed after a long period of time and also what the definition of long is depends on the bank eventually if left uncashed it probably would be to the state to wait for someone to claim it being that it 's been less than a year i expect it could be cashed by the payee written on the check without any issues if the payee is deceased then the check can be cashed by the estate as it should be considered the property of the estate the same way it would be if it had already been cashed and was now sitting in a bank account in your mother 's name under normal circumstances the estate in this case would go to your mother 's spouse first then to you and your siblings if you have any unless there is a will specifying otherwise the only way your aunt would be able to deposit the check on her own is if she was listed as an or on the check or if she is the executor of op 's mother 's estate it sounds like the second line of the check is indeed referring to your aunt however from your description of the check it sounds like the second line is simply a designation of what the check is for rather than an additional payee i bet a probate attorney in your state could easily tell by simply looking at the check

the government does n't borrow money it in fact simply prints it the bond market is used for an advanced way of controlling the demand for this printed money think about it logically take 2011 for example the govt spent $ 1.7 trillion more than it took in this is real money that get 's credited in to people 's bank accounts to purchase real goods and services now who purchases the majority of treasuries the primary dealers what are the primary dealers they are banks where do banks get their money from us   so now put two and two together when the govt spends $ 1.7 trillion and credits our bank accounts the banking system has $ 1.7 trillion more then that money flows in to pension funds gets spent in to corporation who then send that money to china for cheap products and eventually the money spent purchases up govt securities for investments we had to physically give china 1 trillion dollars for them to be able to purchase 1 trillion dollars in securities so it makes sense if you think about how the math works in the real world

the interest rate of 3 and 7.5 is for funds held in regular savings account that are denominated in rupee moving these funds back to us will require compliance with indian foreign exchange act if you are not intending to move funds back to us then this would be good move however you would still need to pay tax in us on the interest generated as personal tax in us requires one to pay tax on income world wide as also pointed out by others there is a risk of fx conversion the other option is to hold funds in nre or usd denominated where funds can be moved back to us without any and are held in usd however the interest rate on these accounts is similar to what one would get in us slightly better at best so you need to figure out if you need the funds back in us then i guess keeping it in us would be a good move however if you do not need the funds back in us then moving it to india would make sense

i personally believe if one average income could support the needs of a family nothing extravagant and the parents had options instead of only one of the parents having the ability to work for an income that supports a family it would be better at the micro view there would be less and more time for family i feel bad now bc i 'm stretched so thin i do n't even have time to watch a tv show with our kids during the week    in our situation my husband never finished school his mom let him drop out in the 7th grade so his work options are very limited he has had to work out of town jobs since before we started dating i graduated high school but due to having kids early i put off college because of the expense of daycare i stayed at home with the kids for about 5 years the plan is i get my degree next fall get a decent paying job to support the family   and he can figure out what he wants to do as a career and be able to pursue it without having the pressure of having to make an income to support a family i have been him to at least get an online high school diploma in the mean time but i think he is self conscious and scared he ca n't do it we are n't the keeping up with the jones kind of people i 'm just trying to reach some goals and be financially stable and not worry about if we have enough money in the bank for bills or if the car breaks down if we are screwed    a teacher 's job is very time consuming so it definitely will be a challenge if you do n't work a job that allows you to help out at my internship this summer the cfo was able to just leave and bring his daughter to work whenever he needed to that luxury is not afforded to many    also on a side when you have kids please make an effort to take your paternity leave if your job offers it you deserve it employees should n't feel bad for taking the benefits their company offers gender equality

you could pay off a portion of the debt and your minimum payments should also go down proportionately   your investment managers may be able to continue making returns in the markets in a sideways and a bear market so you have 24k contributing to your net worth and giving you a negative net worth at best you can bring this down to a negative 25k net worth or you can start and keep using some of the gains from your investment account to supplement your credit payments along with your income this is based on chance that your investment managers can continue making gains compared to paying down 24k and having possibly zero liquid savings now but having more of your salary to start saving and make the lowered minimum payments assuming you do n't borrow more those are the options i 've thought of i do n't see either option being necessarily quicker than the other

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

because retirement account usually are tax effective vehicles meaning you will pay less tax on any profits from your investments in a retirement account than you would outside for example in my country australia for someone on say $ 60,000 per annum if you make $ 10,000 profits on your investments that year you will end up paying tax or $ on that $ 10,000 profits if you made the same profits in a retirement account superannuation fund you would have only paid 15 tax or $ 1,500 on the $ 10,000 profit that 's less than half the tax and if you are on a higher income the savings would be even greater the reason why you ca n't take the money out of a retirement account is purely because the aim is to build up the funds for your retirement and not take it out at any time you want you are given the incentive to pay less tax on any investment profits in order for you to save and grow your funds so that you might have a more comfortable retirement a time when you might not be able to work any more for your money

think again     all prosperity ultimately comes from the generation -the of wealth     we create wealth out of the ether when we take a thing physical which is worth little and turn it into a thing that is worth more with the power of an idea and the application of labor   on a macro scale that translates into the manufacturing sector   the manufacturing sector in the us has changed it 's not gone   it 's spectacularly healthy in a of new ways while all the old ones have died off or are dying a slow death   the new manufacturing sector demands skill not just attendance   unskilled work is drying up because under current laws unskilled people cost more to employ than they can possibly produce but someone with a skill in trade can get a job in half a heartbeat especially if they are willing to move to where the job is   no nation of any size can prosper without the internal generation of real wealth   the idea that we can be a nation of bankers and managers is laughable and is precisely what got us into our current situation   the future is and will always be in making new things   labor is not a word and it does not equate to a second class existence as pay rates are currently demonstrating   it was geniuses working in the trades who were the innovators and entrepreneurs that built american industrial power thus economic power in the first place     it will be again

as joetaxpayer says there 's a lot you can do with just the stock price exploring that a bit stock prices are a combination of market sentiment and company fundamentals options are just a layer on top of that as such options are mostly which is why you have a hard time finding historical option data it 's just not that interesting technically mostly because there are known issues with the assumptions the black scholes formula makes it 's pretty good and importantly the market relies on it to determine fair option pricing option prices are determined by relationship of stock price to strike both distance and time to expiration dividends since dividend payments reduce the intrinsic value of a company the prospect of dividend payments during the life of a call option depresses the price of the option as all else equal without the payments the stock would be more likely to end up in the money reverse the logic for puts volatility interest rates but this effect is so tiny it 's safe to ignore 4 volatility is the everything else is known that 's why option trading is often considered volatility trading there are many ways to skin this cat but the result is that by using quoted historical values for the stock price and the dividend payments and if you like interest rates you can very closely determine what the price of the option would have been very closely depending on your volatility assumption you could calculate then historical volatility for each time period by figuring the average price swing in either direction for say the past year year before the date in question so you 'd do this each day walking forward read up on it and try various volatility approaches and see if your results are within a reasonable range re the black scholes formula   there 's a free spreadsheet downloadable from you might find it useful to grab the concept for coding it up yourself it 's vba but you can certainly use that info to translate in your language of choice or if you prefer to read perl has a good module with full source of course i find this approach easier than reading a calculus formula but i 'm a better developer than math geek

so let 's take a mortgage loan that allows prepayment without penalty say i have a 30 year mortgage and i have paid it for 15 years by the 16th year almost all the interest on the 30 year loan has been paid to the bank this is incorrect thinking   on a 30 year loan at year 15 about 2/3 's of the total interest to be paid has been paid and the principal is about 1/3 lower than the original loan amount   you may want to play with some amortization calculators that are freely available to see this in action    if you were to pay off the balance at that point you would avoid paying the remaining 1/3 of interest    consider a 100 k 30 year mortgage at 4.5 in month two the payment breaks down with $ 132 going to principal and $ going to interest   if in month one you had an extra $ 132 and directed it to principal you would save $ in interest   that is a great roi and why it is wonderful to get out of debt as soon as possible    the trouble with this is of course is that most people can barely afford the mortgage payment when it is new so lets look at the same situation in year 15 here $ would go to principal and $ 235 to interest   so you would have to come up with more money to save less interest   it is still a great roi but less dramatic    if you understand the magic of compounding interest then you can understand loans   it is just compounding interest in reverse   it works against you

it seems that you 're interested in an asset which you can hold that would go up when the gold price went down it seems like a good place to start would be an index fund which invests in the general stock market when the gold market falls this would mainly affect gold mining companies these do not make up a sizable portion of any index fund which is invested broadly in the market unfortunately in order to act on this you would also have to believe that the stock market was a good investment    to test this theory i looked at an etf index fund which tracks the s&p 500 and compared it to an etf which invests in gold   i found that the daily price movements of the stock market were positively correlated with the price of gold this result was statistically significant   the weekly price movements of the stock market were also correlated with the price of gold this result was also statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one month there was still a positive relationship between the stock market 's price moves and the price of gold this result was not statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one year there was a negative relationship between the price changes in the stock market and the price of gold   this result was not statistically significant either

whether or not you make money here depends on whether you are buying or selling the option when you open your position   you certainly would not make money in the scenario where you are buying options at the open   if fact you would end up loosing quite a lot of money you do not specify whether you are buying or selling the options so let 's assume that you are buying both the call and the put   we 'll look a profitable trade at the bottom of my answer buying an in the money call option with a strike price of $ 90 when the underlying asset price is $ 150 would cost you a small fraction over $ 6000 = 100 x $ 60 since the intrinsic value value of the option is $ 60   add to this cost any commission charged by your broker buying an out of the money put option with a strike price of $ 110 when the underlying asset price is $ 150 would cost you a small premium lets say a premium of something like $ 0.50   the option has no intrinsic value only time value and a volatility value so the exact cost would depend on the time to expiry and the implied volatility of the underlying asset since the strike price is well out of the money being about 27 below the underlying asset price the premium would be small   so assuming the premium of $ 0.50 you would pay $ 50 for the option plus any commission applicable the cash settlement on expiry with an underlying settlement price of $ 100 would be a premium of $ 10 for each of the two options so you would receive cash of 100 x $ 10 + $ 10 = $ 2000 less any commission applicable   however you have paid $ 6000 + $ 50 to purchase the options so you realise a net loss of $ $ 2000 = $ 4050 plus any commissions applicable thus you would make a profit on the put option but you would realise a very large loss on the call option on the other hand if you open your position by selling the call option and buying the put option then you would make money for the sale of the call option you would receive about $ 6000   for the purchase of the put option you would pay about $ 50 on settlement you would pay $ 1000 to buy back the call option and you would receive about $ 1000 when selling the put option thus you net profit would be about $ 6000 $ 1000 for the call position and $ 1000 $ 50 for the put position   the net profit would then total $ less an commissions payable

determine an investment strategy and that will likely answer this for you different people have different approaches and you need to determine for yourself what buy and sell criteria you want to have again depending on the strategy there can be a wide range here as some may trade index funds though this can backfire in some cases in others there can be a lot of buy and hold if one finds an index fund to hold forever which depending on the strategy is possible returns can vary widely as an index can be everything from buying gold stocks in russia to investing in short term treasuries as there are many different indices as any given market can have an index which could be stocks bonds a combination of the two or something else in some cases so please consider asset allocation types of accounts risk tolerance and time horizon in making decisions or consider using a financial planner to assist in drawing up a plan with allocations and how frequently you want to rebalance as my suggestion here

there are 2 primary ways to bet against a stock if you think it will decline the first is to short sell shares of that stock the second is to buy put options i would also add that selling naked call options would also be a bet against but i do n't believe that is as common as the other 2 mentioned methods the problem with short selling an ipo is that you first have to borrow the shares you are going to sell since the shares are privately held prior to the ipo that can be problematic even after the ipo you may have to wait a bit before shares become available to borrow   the problem with options either buying puts or seeking naked calls is similar options are traded on a different exchange than the stock and they have their own requirements that a stock must meet to have options traded both of these problems eventually correct themselves however not in time for you to catch the initial fall you seem to be looking for

because i feel the answers given do not represent the answer you are expecting i 'd like to re but include more information when you own stock in a company you own some of that company when that company makes profit you usually receive a dividend of those profits if you owned 1 of the company stock you should recieve 1 of the profits if your company is doing well someone might ask to buy your stock the price of that stock is supposed to be worth a value representative of the expected yield or how much of a dividend you 'd be getting   the worth of that is what you 're betting on when you buy the stock if you buy $ 100 worth of coca cola stock and they paid $ 10 as dividend you 'd be pretty happy with a 10 growth in your wealth especially if the banks are only playing 3 so maybe some other guy sees your 10 increase and thinks heck 10 is better than 3 if i buy your stocks even as much as 6 more than they are worth $ 106 i 'm still going to be better off by that extra 1 than i would be if i left it in the bank so he offers you $ 106 and you think awesome i can sell my $ 100 of cola shares now make a $ 6 profit and buy $ 100 worth of some other share i think will pay a good dividend then cola their profits and they only made 2 profit that guy that bought your shares for $ 106 only got a dividend of $ 2 since their worth is still $ 100 and effectively he lost $ 4 as a result he bet on a better than 10 profit and lost out when it did n't hit that now imho while the stock market was supposed to be about buying shares and getting dividends people brokers discovered that you could make far more money buying and selling shares for perceived value rather than waiting for dividends to show actual value especially if you were not the one doing the buying and selling and risk but instead making a 0.4 cut off the difference between each purchase broker fees so tl;dr   many people have lost money in the market to those who made money from them but only the traders and gamblers

i am not sure but probably it depends upon the cut the credit card company receives from the merchant for hotels such as dining etc the cut could be more again periodically many merchants join with the card company to launch promotions it could be part of such promotions apart from class of merchants these points also differ on class of cards e.g a premium card will earn more rewards than a simple classic card

one difference is the bid ask spread will cost you more in a lower cost stock than a higher cost one say you have two highly liquid stocks with tiny spreads if you wanted to buy say $ 2,000 of stock now imagine these are almost identical etfs tracking the s&p 500 index and extrapolate this to a trade of $ 2,000,000 and you can see there 's some cost savings in the higher priced stock as a practical example recently a popular s&p 500 etf vanguard 's voo did a reverse split to help investors minimize this oft missed cost

i like the answers others gave if it 's some substantial debt you definitely could go the bankruptcy route but it damages your future also it 's morally unethical to borrow all that money and not intend to pay second if you can pay off the entire balance and clear out the 23 interest than i 'd do that first one less bill to concern yourself with now let 's say you 've been making $ 100 payments monthly on each card my assumption for this examples sale now instead of paying $ 100 to the remaining cards balance each month and saving the other $ 100 pay $ 200 against the remaining credit cards balance by not taking home any money this way you are tackling the liability that is costing you money every month unless you have a great investment opportunity on that remaining $ 1000 or have n't created much of an emergency fund yet i 'd consider putting more of that money towards the debt gaining 0.01 on savings interest still means you 're eating in debt monthly if you 're able to i 'd venture out to open a zero interest card and do a balance transfer over to that new card there will be a minimal transfer fee but you may get some cash back out of it and also that zero interest for a year would help hold off more interest accruing while you 're tackling the balance

as michael pryor answered a bond fund is a mutual fund that invests in bonds i 'd also consider an etf based on bonds to be a bond fund but i 'm not sure that all investors would consider these as bond funds not all bond funds are the same just like stock funds you can classify bond funds based on the issuer of the bonds you can also classify funds based on the time to maturity in general bond funds have lower risk and lower expected return than stock funds sometimes bond funds have price movements that are not tightly correlated to the price movements in the equity markets this can make them a decent hedge against declines in your equity investments see pryor 's answer for some info on how you can get tax free treatment for your bond fund investments

all of this assumes that this relationship is n't as employer employee relationship which would require you to withhold taxes if you send them a small token of appreciation and you are unable to record it as a business expense or some other deductible expense you do n't have to be concerned about how they claim it they decide if they want to risk claiming it was a gift or if they want to record it as an expense even if you say some magic phrase that you think will impress the irs the recipient can still decide declare it as income to have any hope of being able to treat it as a gift they would have to be able to demonstrate that there is a non business relationship   if you can claim it as a business expense or a deductible expense   they will have to also claim it as income because your documentation could point the irs to their lack of documentation   giving them a check or sending the payment electronically will require them to claim it as an income since an audit could require them to explain every line on their bank statements

if you mortgage after the fact you will usually pay an extra .25 higher on the interest rate because a cash out refinance is treated as riskier than a new home purchase mortgage you might save enough on the purchase price of the home with a cash offer to make that higher interest rate worth it but in most cases if you are planning to hold the loan for a long time it 's best to get that mortgage at the time of purchase you might be able to get the same deal with an offer that says you will pay cash if there are any problems getting the loan approved

getting a mortgage for the interest write off is like buying packs of baseball cards for the gum that said i 'd refer you to the correct order of investing as much of that question really overlaps with this this question boils down to priorities the best use of the funds there are those who suggest that a mortgage brings risk of course it does just not for the borrower the risk is borne by the lender risk comes from lack of liquidity say your girlfriend buys the house with cash and leaves little reserve she loses her job and it 's great that she has no mortgage but she does have every other cost life brings including a tax bill that can turn into a house getting foreclosed on the details that you did n't disclose are those needed to look at the rest of the priorities list a fully funded 401(k with appropriate balance and no other debt and a 1 year emergency fund i would n't argue against buying the house with cash no real savings and passing on the 401(k matched deposit i 'd think carefully about the longterm impact of the cash purchase

as others have said doing a monthly budget is a great idea   i tried the tracking expenses method for years and it got me nowhere i think for these reasons if budgeting is n't your cup of tea try the pay yourself first method   here as soon as you get a paycheck take some substantial portion immediately and use it to pay down debt or put it in savings if you have no debt    doing this will force you to spend less money on impulse items and force you to really watch your spending   if you take this option be absolutely sure you do n't have any open credit accounts or you 'll just use them to make up the difference when you find yourself broke in the middle of the month the overall key here is to get yourself into a long term mind set   always ask yourself things like am i going to care that i did n't have this in 10 years 5 years 2 months 2 days even   and ask yourself things like would i this now or this later plus being 100 debt free and not having to worry if i have a steady paycheck    i think what finally kicked my butt and made me realize i needed a long term mind set was reading the millionaire next door by tom stanley   it made me realize that the rich get rich by constantly thinking in the long term and therefore being more frugal not by leveraging debt on real estate or something like 90 of the other books out there tell you

i have had pension programs with two companies   the first told you what your benefit would be if you retired at age x with y years of service each year of service got you a percentage of your final years salary there was a different formula for early retirement and there was an offset for social security they were responsible for putting enough money away each year to meet their obligations just before i left they did add a new feature you could get the funds in the account in a lump sum when you left if you left early you got the money in the account if you left at retirement age you got the money that was needed to produce the benefit you were promised which was based on current interest rates the second company had a plan where they published the funding formula you knew with every quarterly statement how much was in your account and what interest it had earned and what benefit they estimated you would receive if you stayed until retirement age this fund felt almost like a defined contribution because the formula was published if most people took the lump sum that was the only part that mattered both pension plans had a different set of formulas based on marriage status and survivor rules the interest rates are important because they are used to determine how much money is needed to produce the promised monthly benefit they are also used to determine how much they need to allocate each year to cover their obligations   if you ca n't make the math work you need to keep contacting hr you need to understand how much should be flowing into the account each month

thanks for the link to the financial consumer agency of canada it explained in clear terms that i can withdraw money from and transfer money to the line of credit any time i want the only monthly payment needed is the minimum payment and yes it may have a term after which all remaining principal + interest must be paid back in full similar to a credit card as you pay off your line of credit you can    draw on it again up to the limit you are allowed however a key    difference between a line of credit and a credit card is that with a    line of credit there is no interest free grace period you will have    to pay interest on the amount you borrow from the day you take the    money out you will receive a monthly statement that shows the amount that you    owe on your line of credit you must make at least a minimum payment    on that balance every month specific terms and conditions for lines of credit vary from institution to institution

invest in a high quality dividend paying group of stocks   look up stock   to find longterm quality stocks that have regularly increased their dividends for over is a safe period of time to invest in stocks   if you had bought stocks at their in 2007 and kept them through the 40 decline thru 2008 and 2009 and held on to them for 10 years until 2017 you would have earned a 40 increase from when you purchased them   that is pretty much a worst case   if you had invested in dividend paying stocks and had earned an additional 2.5 per year you would have exceeded your 5 goal the lifetime yearly return of the stock market is 10   time is the only downside but with ten years you are almost certainly immune

i can see where you are coming from but with that logic then apple spent all that time and money to develop and market the iphone 8 just to use it as an expensive marketing device and i do n't buy that if they did do that however it would have made more sense for them to increase the storage slightly and keep the price of the iphone 7 the same and then release the iphone x. that way they would have a little more profit from the 7 since cost of production is cheaper now that it is a year old and consumers can either have the newest iphone and shell out for it or have an iphone that still works great and now comes with more storage now if they called the iphone 8 the iphone i think there would n't be such a negative image about it in terms of it being a rather small upgrade because the s iteration usually is just a spec bump and no one would bat an eye at that but since it got the title of being the 8th iphone people expect more from it

yes that is not an unusual number in some states the state tax rate is fairly flat and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat the big issue is the federal number several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income and the taxes though the net check will get smaller keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer the tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same for those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck the average paycheck for the first part of the year this can put you in a higher bracket than you should be and result in a large refund when you file in the spring   you can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding

the exact percentages depend on many things not just location for example everyone needs food   if you have a low income the percentage of your income spent on food would be much higher than for someone that has a high income any budgeting guidelines that you find are just a starting point   you need to look at your own income and expenses and come up with your own spending plan start by listing all of the necessities that you have to spend on   for example your basic necessities might be fund those categories and any other fixed expenses that you have   whatever you have left is available for other things such as and anything else that you can think of to spend money on   if you can save money on some of the necessities above it will free up money on the discretionary categories below    because your income and priorities are different than everyone else your budget will be different than everyone else too   if you are new to budgeting you might find that the right budgeting software can make the task much easier   ynab everydollar or mvelopes are three popular choices

he offered a 15 stake   he showed willingness to move from his original position by moving to 20   this left the door open for further discussions but if the last shark was n't offering royalties or something else to sweeten the pot he was n't going to budge much more than maybe to 22.5   you give away too much too easily and a seasoned negotiator smells blood and goes for it   every round of negotiations needs to offer a bit more but less than the additional offered in the previous round and not without receiving something in return so after increasing by 5 to 20 he would not have added another 35 based on their arguments he would reason why an additional 2.5 would be the most he could offer without additional consideration if he jumped from 15 to say 40 too easily the other negotiator would be looking for an additional 20 after that   so he went from 15 to 20 in response to the 75 equity stake and did nothing to seem or unreasonable while setting the tone for the next and last negotiator   the last guy was n't willing to walk away and showed that he was n't going to be pushed into a bad deal so a deal got done   dunno if that makes sense but his assertions coupled with strong but fair negotiating skills and a product that at least one person saw value in or any negotiation would be pointless won the day

what you are suggesting will not work banks have strict guidelines about what they can and can not do with an fha loan property remember the fha is only an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan   the bank wo n't take the risk of violating their insurance policy and the government refusing to pay them off if you default instead consider doing a creative sale on your property maybe a rent to own deal or owner financing as long as you pay the mortgage the bank wo n't even know you do n't live there and you can rent the house out to someone who eventually will buy it after the timeframe expires meanwhile you can go and get a new home or condo either thru regular financing or owner the internet to see how to do this and you can use owner financing until you complete the sale of the first house otherwise just tough it out in the house you are in until the time expires and then sell you made no mention of the property value but i am assuming if you bought it 3 years ago that you may have a little equity note that if you sell at that time though you will likely have to come out of cash because your equity wo n't cover the realtor fee and closing cost but if you do the rent to own i suggested earlier you can sell at a slightly higher price making sure you can cover those cost i realize this answer is a little out the box but i deal with people who do n't want properties all day and i have completed transactions like this many times good luck and god bless

when you invest in a single index security you are completely exposed to the risk of that security diversification means spreading the investments so the losses on one side can be compensated by the gains on the other side what you are talking about is one thing called risk more formally known as risk tolerance risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand emphasis added this means that you are willing to accept some losses in order to get a potential bigger return fidelity has this graph   as you can see in the table above the higher the risk tolerance the bigger the difference between the best and worst values that is the variability the right most pie can be one example of an agressive diversified portfolio but this does not mean you should go and buy exactly that security high risk means playing with fire unless you are a professional playing with fire usually leaves people burnt in a financial context this usually means the money is gone recommended reading investopedia risk and diversification the risk reward tradeoff investopedia how to construct a high risk portfolio fidelity guide to diversification kpmg understanding and risk appetite pdf

let p denote the amount of the investment r the rate of return and i the rate of inflation   for simplicity assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned   thus at the end if the year the investment p has increased to and p is returned as the annuity payment if i = 0 the entire return can be paid out as the payment and thus p = that is at the end of the year when the dust settles after the return has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment p is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate r. we have p = p if i > 0 then at the end of the year after the dust settles we can not afford to have only p available as the investment for next year next year 's payment must be p*(1+i and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed   how much larger   well if the investment at the beginning of next year is p*(1+i it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments note   that we are assuming that r > i. if r < i a perpetuity can not be created   thus suppose that we choose p such that p = p*(1+i    multiplying this equation by we have p*(1+i = in words at the start of next year the investment is p*(1+i and the return less the increased payout of p*(1+i leaves an investment of for the following year   each year the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of solving p = p*(1+i for p we get   p = i   as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor each year   the initial investment is p and it also increases by a factor of each year in later years the investment is at the start of the year the payment is and the amount invested for the next year is this is the same result as obtained by the op but written in terms that i can understand that is without the financial jargon about discount rates pv fv and the like

whether or not you 'll be allowed to enter the uk is a topic for a different forum and really more a topic for a lawyer rather than strangers on the internet that being said as a non lawyer giving my opinion of the situation you should be granted access to the uk as the banks money lenders phone companies do n't have a relationship with border entry with regards to debts in the uk there is some precedent to debts being waived after a certain period of time but the minimum is 6 years for unsecured debt and the companies you owe money to can still chase you for payment but ca n't use legal proceedings to force you to pay however the big caveat to this is that this only applies to residents of england and wales   from the site what is out of date debt debts like these are covered by the limitation act 1980 which is a    statute of limitations that provides time scales as to how long a    creditor can chase you the debtor for an unpaid debt the limitation    act 1980 only applies when no acknowledgement of a debt has been made    between you and the creditor for six years for unsecured debts or 12    years for mortgage shortfalls and secured loans this law only applies    to residents of england and wales when does debt go out of date if the creditor fails to maintain contact with you for six years or    more you may be able to claim that the outstanding debt is statute    barred under the limitation act 1980 this means the creditor can not    use the legal system to enforce payment of the outstanding debt the    time limit starts from when you last acknowledged owing the debt or    made a payment to the account when can a creditor pursue an unsecured debt   you may think a creditor has written off your debt if you have n’t heard from them for    a long time the reality is that the debt still exists the creditor    can still contact you and they are entitled to chase the outstanding    debt even if the debt has been statute barred but they are unable to    use legal proceedings to force you to pay creditors can pursue an    unsecured debt if

yes eligibility for contributing to a roth ira is determined by your modified adjusted gross income magi which is based on your adjusted gross income agi now agi includes the net capital gains from your transactions and magi adds back in things that were subtracted off e.g. tuition deductions foreign earned income exclusion in arriving at the agi there is a worksheet in publication 590 that has the details you are always entitled to contribute to a traditional ira the magi affects how much of your contribution is tax deductible on that year 's tax return but not your eligibility to contribute   both the above paragraphs assume that you have enough compensation wages salary self employment income to contribute to an ira the contribution limit is $ 5500 or total compensation whichever is smaller if you earned only $ 2 k as wages you can contribute all of it not just your take home pay which is what is left after social security and medicare taxes federal taxes etc have been withheld from that $ 2 k if your entire income is from capital gains and stock dividends you can not contribute to any kind of ira at all

i would hold off on making that threat closing your account first because as others have said it 's not likely to help and second assuming you 're willing to make good on that threat you should only play that card as a final absolute last resort because if it fails and you close your account there is little to nothing else you can try to get what you want first talk one on one with a personal banker at your local ba branch you might be surprised at how helpful they can be next try talking to customer service on the phone after that you might try sending a letter to corporate hq a lot depends on the particular feature you are talking about and why they removed it it could be that 1 the bank finds the feature is just too costly provide for free 2 there may be a technical reason why they can no longer provide it 3 it could be as simple as that few to none of their customers excluding you are actually using the feature or 4 it could be that due to changing regulation or market forces no bank is offering that feature anymore also while they may not care specifically about your business the local branch has an incentive to not drive customers away if it can be reasonably avoided

thanks it has taken me some time to understand how all this works and there are still many gray areas i want to understand further   the fed interest rate is the rate charged by banks to loan to each other to balance overnight reserves but only using the reserves they hold at the fed that adds no new money to the system but increases the money multiplier a little since perhaps more loans can be made    basically one bank with excess reserves can loan to another bank that needs reserves the fed injects no money here only sets the rate for banks to do this with each other   when the fed buys securities that effectively adds that many more dollars into circulation which then gets hit by the money multiplier adding a lot of new liquidity   i think historically the latter tracks increases in the money supply much better than the former i think the st. louis fed has records online for all this dating back to the 1940 's or so

i do n't think anyone can give you a definitive answer without knowing all about your situation but some things to consider if you are on a 1099 you have to pay self employment tax while on a w-2 you do not that is social security tax is 12.4 of your income if you 're a 1099 you pay the full 12.4 if you 're w-2 you pay 6.2 and the employer pays 6.2 so if they offer you the same nominal rate of pay you 're 6.2 better off with the w-2 what sort of insurance could you get privately and what would it cost you i have no idea what the going rates for insurance are in california if you 're all in generally good health you might want to consider a high deductible policy then if no one gets seriously sick you 've saved a bunch of money on premiums if someone does get sick you might still pay less paying the deductible than you would have paid on higher premiums i wo n't go into further details as that 's getting off into another question even if the benefits are poor if there are any benefits at all it can be better than nothing the only advantage i see to going with a 1099 is that if you are legally an independent contractor then all your business expenses are deductible while if you are an employee there are sharp limits on deducting employee business expenses maybe others can think of other advantages if there is some reason to go the 1099 route i understand that setting up an llc is not that hard i 've never done it but i briefly looked into it once and it appeared to basically be a matter of filling out a form and paying a modest fee

you know what lowers wages   social safety nets   before you read that as advocating for the removal of social safety nets hear me out   a low wage service company would in the absence of any social safety net be required to pay employees far more   why   because employees would be required to cover all of their needs with their wage   no food stamps medicaid etc     what then would higher wages do   it would cut back on the need to spend on social safety nets   higher wages provide employees with the ability to cover more of their own needs with their labor income     unfortunately this is a chicken or egg problem   i would never cut social safety netting before advocating for higher wages because i would n't leave people out in the cold without needed assistance   so where do i stand   i advocate for higher wages first so that we can gradually decrease taxpayer funded social safety nets for working americans later

firstly well done on building a really sold base of savings an emergency fund needs to have two key characteristics be enough to get you through a typical emergency event often seen as approx ~6 salary in your style of situation assuming you have no dependents etc be liquid and available to you instantly if an emergency arises once you have decided how much you will need for 1 you then generally find the best interest available on an instant access savings account and leave it there it 's important to note that because you need it very liquid and very secure you will basically never make nor should   you expect to make any sizeable rate of interest on your emergency fund once this is done whatever left should be invested in an asset mix of assets that best fit your risk profile of which long term bonds are a completely legitimate option but it 's hard to say without knowing more about your long term aims liabilities job market etc

at the very least you should invest as much as you can that your employer will match as they are basically giving you free money for saving after that i would prioritize a roth ira as that offers similar tax benefits with more liquidity provided you have enough money available in your emergency fund and have plenty for everyday expenses i see no reason not to max out your 401k after that if you can afford it however if your emergency fund is lacking be sure to put some there other investments like a 529 may come into play if you have kids you plan on sending to college but it all depends on your situation

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

in general the goal of an s&p 500 index fund is to replicate the performance of the s&p 500 index   to do this the fund will buy the same stocks in the same proportions as the weighting of the index the s&p 500 index is free float capitalization weighted   this means that the higher capitalization stocks based on publicly traded shares only are more heavily weighted and factor into the index value more heavily than the smaller capitalization stocks or the stocks that have a smaller publicly traded value   for example companies like apple and microsoft have a much larger weight in the index value than smaller companies alternatively there are some s&p index funds that are equal weighted   in these funds the managers have chosen to purchase all 500 of the stocks in the index but in equal proportions instead of the weighted proportions of the index   these equal weighted funds will not as closely match the index price as the traditionally weighted index funds   instead they might do better or worse than the index depending on how the individual stocks do you 'll need to look at the prospectus of the index funds you are interested in to see which approach the fund is taking

another way to look at it is that deductibles are intended as incentives or subsidies to particular industries in this case the healthcare industry guaranteeing a decent standard of living and making sure everybody can meet the costs of necessities can be achieved much more easily by a low tax rate on the first of income and/or generic welfare benefits rather than any measure focused on making healthcare food or whatnot cheaper or free under certain conditions incidentally many countries do have different forms of benefits or tax breaks for accommodation related expenses

i do n't think you 're stupid evil bad or anything like that   i 'm sure in fact that you are an intelligent nice person who only wants the best for everyone   i just think that you are in a willful refusing to understand the difference between insurance and healthcare   it 's not that you are incapable it is that you simply refuse to do so   you are doing so to justify making the bad guy out of an industry whose goal is to make health care accessible to as many people as possible by spreading out the cost of health emergencies over time which is mis directed anger   i fully appreciate and understand that most health care is payed for via insurance   however this is entirely an artifact of business tax deductions which make it cheaper for individuals to accept part of their compensation in the form of health insurance benefits   health care and insurance are n't intrinsically they are bound together in the us due to the tax code     so what you should be arguing for is the removal of business health care tax deductions and direct financial assistance for the poor   this would make insurance and healthcare a more competitive market which would in turn drive costs down and by giving the money directly to the impoverished more of the benefit would reach them rather than creating some huge bureaucracy that it has to be filtered through first   but instead you are choosing to a industry for not handing out free health care which is misguided at best

@joetaxpayer 's answer outlines how to value it some other considerations as i understand it some public pensions may be tax free if you still live in the state that is paying the pension e.g. when a massachusetts teacher receives pension it is exempt from state taxes but if that person moves to vermont he will have to pay vermont income tax on those payments so if you plan to stay in the state post retirement this provides additional value pension payments are n't fully guaranteed by the pbgc and not all pension plans are fully funded depending on the political and economic environment when you hit retirement your retirement plan could suffer and if you are n't working you may not have a union vote any more when the other working members are voting on contract amendments that affect pensions i 'm not certain of all of the rules but i hear news reports from time to time that formulas like what you 've posted in the original question are changed through negotiation with the union if you make an employment decision using the formula in year x and then the formula changes in year your expected pension payment will change

the other answers assumed student loan debt and for that it 's rarely worth it unless your company only offers managed plans w/ really bad returns or the economy recovers to the point where banks are paying 5 again on money market accounts but if it 's high rate debt such as carrying a credit card debt and the current rate of returns on the 401k are n't that great at the time it would be worth doing the calculations to see if it 's better to pay them down instead if you 're carrying extremely high interest debt such as payday loans or similar it 's almost always going to be worth paying down that debt as quickly as possible even if it means forgoing matching 401k payments the other possible reason for not taking the matching funds are if the required contributions would put you in a significant bind if you 're barely scraping by and you ca n't squeeze enough savings out of your budget that you 'd risk default on a loan eg car or house or might take penalties for late fees on your utilities it might be preferable to save up for a bit before starting the contributions especially if you 've maxed your available credit so you ca n't just push stuff to credit cards as a last resort

this is a very interesting question   unfortunately in the way you wrote the question the answer is no   essentially you would be asking someone to give you a ~20 return for your cash on something that is almost guaranteed when holding your cash only gets them a < 1 return   would anyone take the other side of that deal interestingly though you can to some extent hedge surprises in health care costs   for instance investing in the healthcare industry as david rice suggests is a partial hedge   the prices of those industry stocks already has future expected cost increases included however if costs were to jump even higher than expected you would gain some of the added cost you would pay in healthcare back not that i recommend this strategy as you lose diversification but this is a valid and reasonable reason to slightly overweight american healthcare companies for someone in your situation    note that the wiki article you mention talks about hedging surprises as well   if at planting time the farmer sells a number of wheat futures contracts equivalent to his anticipated crop size he effectively locks in the price of wheat at that time   thinking that way you may actually be able to buy health insurance now for two or three years in the future essentially locking in expected price increases today   probably not the answer you were looking for but the best analogy for what financial hedging truly does

no it wo n't affect your score until your statement is posted paying your bill before your statement is posted is actually a good way to keep your credit utilization low if you 're worried about high credit utilization negatively affecting your credit score consider paying your bill several times a month to ensure that when your final monthly statement is posted your utilization is still low when my credit limit was very low while i was in college i did this almost every month and i 've seen other sites recommend this practice as well from creditkarma.com the easiest way to lower credit utilization is to make credit card payments more than once a month so that your balance never gets too high and consider making payments to creditors more than once each month otherwise if you put a major expense like a new appliance on a credit card even if you plan to pay it off your fico score may take a hit the reason is that credit scores are calculated as a snapshot in time so if that happens to be right after you charged a new $ 700 washing machine your utilization ratio will look high remember though that it 's best to have some balance on your card when your statement is posted assuming you pay it off in full each month because as the chart shows 0 utilization is about as bad as utilization > 31 40   also remember that credit utilization affects your credit score in real time so if you have high utilization one month but a lower utilization the next month the hit to your score will disappear once a statement with low utilization is posted

already a lot of great answers but since i ask myself this same question i thought i 'd share my 2 cents   as pointed out behavior is of the essence here if you 're like most recent grads this is probably the first time in your life you are getting serious about building wealth can you pay your loans down quickly and then have the discipline to invest just as much if not more than you were putting towards your loans most people are good at paying bills in full and on time yet many struggle to pay themselves in full and on time   as pointed out you can do both i find this makes a great deal of practical sense it helps form good behaviors boosts confidence and diversifies those dollars i have been paying double payments on my student loans while at the same time maxing out my ira hsa 401k i also have a rental property but that 's another can of worms i 'm getting on top and feeling confident in my finances habits etc and my loans are going down with each increase in pay i intend to pay the loans down faster than i invest until they 're paid off   again i like the idea of doing both

there is nothing conceptually wrong with it   if you like it that way go ahead the only thing to watch out for is bank policies that effectively penalize having many small accounts   for instance some banks charge you a fee for checking accounts with a balance below a certain minimum but will waive the fees for accounts with a higher balance   you may be able to avoid such fees by judicious management of your funds or by switching to a different bank but it 's something to be aware of   the interest rates on savings accounts also often vary with the balance making many small balances less efficient than one big balance   however right now at least in the us interest rates on savings accounts are so low that the difference here is likely to be minimal

you can group your like kind same symbol st lt stock positions just be sure that your totals match the total dollar amounts on the 1099   an will possibly result in a letter from irs to clarify so if you sold the 100 shares and they came from 7 different buys list it once   the sell price and date is known and for the buy price add all the buys and put various for the date if you have both long term and short term groups as part of those 7 buys split them into two groups and list them separately

the shortest hand yet most reliable metric is daily volume total shares outstanding   a security with a high turnover rate will be more efficient than a lower one ceteris paribus the practical impacts are tighter spread and lower average percentage change between trades   a security with a spread of 0 and an average change of 0 between trades is perfectly efficient

that 's pretty typical for stores closing   remember that once the stores are conducting their closing sales it 's no longer the company that 's in charge   it may say sears on the sign but it 's actually an outside liquidation company that 's operating the store   the is the one pricing the sales and applying the discounts   their job is to get rid of everything and get as much money for it as they can   will also sometimes bring in outside merchandise to closing stores in order to capitalize on the excitement of the going out of business sales   this news watch?v = shows a case where an outside brought in some to sell at a linens n things that was going out of business   linens n things never sold when it was a going concern but the brought them in complete with a sign saying what the price was and what the sale price is   once you realize that a closing sears store is n't actually sears anymore it all starts to fall into place

what 's the best strategy buy low and sell high now a lot of people try to do this a few are successful but for the most part people who try to time the market end up worse a far more successful strategy is to save over your entire lifetime put the money into a very low cost market fund and just let the average performance take you to retirement put another way if you think that there is an obvious no fail double your money due to a correction strategy you 're wrong otherwise everyone would do it and someone who tells you that there is such a strategy almost surely will be trying to separate you from a good amount of your money   in the end $ 80 k is n't a life altering never have to work again amount of money what i think you ought to do with it is pay off any credit card debts you may have pay a significant chunk of student loan or other personal loan debts you may have make sure you have a decent emergency fund set aside and then put the rest into diversified low cost mutual funds think of it as a nice leg up towards your retirement

well like a lot of stuff on there is not a simple answer but generally it is not a good thing take a look at the wikipedia entry on net operating loss basically the company is commenting that when they do make money they will receive preferential tax treatment on that income     so whether or not this is a positive or a negative depends on a couple of things nol does n't directly impact book value other than how the actual assets of the company changed over the previous quarter i believe there is a 1:1 correspondence to how the assets change and nol but i am sure someone could clarify that for me in another answer or as a comment

in my experience they charge you coming and going for example if a brokerage firm is advertising that their commissions are only $ then that means you pay money to buy the stock plus $ 7 to them and later on if you want to sell that stock you must pay $ 7 to get out of the deal   so if you want to make any money on a stock say priced at $ 10 you would have to sell it at a price above $ that kind of sale could take a few years to turn a profit however with flat rate fees like that it is advantageous to buy in bulk

h1b visas are not terrible and i am not against all h1b visas however it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1 if not only reason companies use them is to cut labor costs these companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region   i think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school like tokyo or london or paris or boston that is going to have the world 's best talent also if those people go back to their they do n't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or but rather the best ideas from all over the world   that is n't at all what is happening in technology there are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the usa out of work and some making six figures with a bs degree and 3 years experience but so many are out of work many of those jobs were outsourced but the talent used was so poor the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive that many companies brought back the jobs to the usa those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers but want them working in the usa for reasons i will spare here the usa talent pool is so full and jobs so scarce it drives down wages not actually because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for and demands 16 hour days 7 days a week for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun and entertainment and space and a gym on site etc   stopping h1b visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms large break rooms increase work life balance etc   stopping h1b visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives less this year than last year which is outrageous in the race to the bottom

this is not an answer to all of your questions but merely an on one of your comments are there any other areas in the uk that would return rental yields    much above 10 net    shares i could withdraw the money and buy shares for the dividend income but it is hard to choose shares that yield more than about 6 and they are volatile i wrote a post about using shares to invest a pension pot you may find it of some interest of course the investing would take place within the pension wrapper so you 'd only be paying tax on the income taken out each year the other alternatives you mention suggest paying for the expertise and time of an ifa would be a very economical decision £ 1,000 to best use £ 150,000 seems a bargain to me some of the avenues you mention seem very risky from my understanding so someone to determine your tolerances and propose a holistic solution is a good path forward best wishes

a good measurement would be to compare to index 's basically a good way to measure your self would be to ask if i put my money somewhere else how much better or worse would i have done mutual funds and hedge funds use the sp500 as a bench mark some funds actually wave their fee if they do not outperform the sp or only take a fee on the portion that has outperformed the sp500 in today 's economy i do nt know how to expect such a return the economy is not a good benchmark on what to expect from the stock market for example in 2009 by certain standards the economy was worse then today but in 2009 the market rallied a great deal so your returns should have reflected that you can use the sp500 as a quick reference to compare your returns this is also considered the standard for a quick comparison the way you compare your performance is also dependent on how you invest your money if you are outperforming the sp500 you are doing well many mutual funds do not outperform the sp500 edit additional info here is an article with more comprehensive information on how to gauge your performance in the article is a link to a free tool from morning star use the right benchmark to accurately measure investment performance

there is a technique called the elliott wave which explains these shocks the reversal directions you are questioning are part of the pattern it is known as corrections the elliott wave is an indicator based on psychology of investors think about it this way if you see a huge up trend what are you most likely to do sell and make profit or continue this is why there is a shock before it continues many people will sell to be safe especially after hearing the bad news they wo n't risk it by learning the elliott wave you 'll be able to make an educated decision on whether or not to stay or leave here are websites on the elliott wave the elliott wave is helpful in any time frame and works well with momentum hope this helps

if you 're into math do this thought experiment consider the outcome x of a random walk process a stock does n't behave this way but for understanding the question you asked this is useful on the first day x = some integer on each subsequent day x goes up or down by 1 with probability 1/2 let 's think of buying a call option on x. a european option with a strike price of s that expires on day n if held until that day and then exercised if profitable would yield a value y = 0 this has an expected value e[y that you could actually calculate should be related to the binomial distribution but my probability statistics hat is n't working too well today the market value of that option on day k where 1 < k < n should be = which you can also actually calculate on day n = y. the value is known an american option if held until day k and then exercised if profitable would yield a value = 0   for the moment forget about selling the option on the market so the choices are either exercise it on some day k or letting it expire let 's say it 's day k =   if > = in the money then you have two choices exercise today or exercise tomorrow if profitable the expected value is the same both are equal to so you might as well exercise it and make use of your money elsewhere if < = s-1 out of the money the expected value is 0 whether you exercise today when you know it 's worthless or if you wait until tomorrow when the best case is if and goes up to s so the option is still worthless but if = s at the money here 's where it gets interesting if you exercise today it 's worth 0 if wait until tomorrow there 's a 1/2 chance it 's worth 0 and a 1/2 chance it 's worth 1 so the expected value is 1/2 therefore you should wait until tomorrow now let 's say it 's day k =   similar situation but more choices if > = you can either sell it today in which case you know the value = or you can wait until tomorrow when the expected value is also again you might as well exercise it now if < = you know the option is worthless if = s-1 it 's worth 0 today whereas if you wait until tomorrow it 's either worth an expected value of 1/2 if it goes up or 0 if it goes down for a net expected value of 1/4 so you should wait if = s it 's worth 0 today whereas tomorrow it 's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up or 0 if it goes down > net expected value of 1/2 so you should wait if = it 's worth 1 today whereas tomorrow it 's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up or 1/2 if it goes down > net expected value of 1.25 so you should wait if it 's day k = and x[n-3 > = then e[y = and you should exercise it now or if x[n-3 < = then   but if x[n-3 = then there 's an expected value e[y of 3 + = if you wait until tomorrow vs. exercising it now with a value of 2 if x[n-3 = then e[y = 2 + = 1.25 vs. exercise value of 1 if x[n-3 = s then e[y = 1 + = 0.75 vs. exercise value of 0 if x[n-3 = s-1 then e[y = 0.5 + = 0.25 vs. exercise value of 0 if x[n-3 = then e[y = 0.25 + = vs. exercise value of 0 in all 5 cases wait until tomorrow you can keep this up the formula is = + for n k > d > k when you should wait and see or 0 for d < = k when it does n't matter and the option is worthless or d for d > = n k when you should exercise the option the market value of the option on day k should be the same as the expected value to someone who can either exercise it or wait it should be possible to show that the expected value of an american option on x is greater than the expected value of a european option on x. the intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money the option should be exercised early   or sold something a european option does n't allow whereas if it is nearly at the money the option should be held whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money the option is definitely worthless as far as real securities go they 're not random walks or at least the probabilities are time varying and more complex but there should be analogous situations and if there 's ever a high probability a stock will go down it 's time to exercise sell an in the money american option whereas you ca n't do that with a european option edit what do you know the computation i gave above for the random walk is n't too different conceptually from the binomial options pricing model

i think the answer to this question depends on how much you trust yourself most people are wonderful at deceiving themselves i 'd personally not trust myself i 'll use 's points for the pitfalls some people get into you can pay off your loans with summer internships and retain the initial cash you had for additional activities that make college enjoyable i.e clubs dinners and social nights   this is actually the risk i 've seen many people do they 'll blow their money in one semester under the assumption that they 'll just earn more in summer and keep it for expenses or the future another benefit to taking these loans would assist in building credit no credit in the usa is actually a good standing many sensible banks or credit unions will happily give people with no credit a loan this makes intuitive sense if you think about it imagine two people with the same income one owes money regularly to multiple sources and the other has no debt obligations which one are you loaning money to simplifying things a lot great credit is best followed by no credit then good credit and then bad credit the advantage of great credit over no credit is simply that some institutions in some sectors do n't have the policies in place to process no credit people no credit people plan to not apply for credit often for self explanatory reasons so this is a point

after a bit of rooting around the hmrc sites i found this page which says this one key difference is that products are classed as electronically supplied services for vat and customs duties these services are for vat purposes the place of supply of these services is the country in which the customer lives if you supply electronic services to a business customer in another european union eu country the customer accounts for any vat due in that country you should not charge uk vat if you supply electronic services to a consumer charity or government body in another eu country you have to account for uk vat if you supply electronic services to anyone in a country outside the eu you do n't pay any vat if as a uk business you buy electronic services from a company outside the uk you have to account for vat if i read this correctly i as the supplier of the website need to account for vat only if the sponsor is a consumer charity or government body in another eu country it is not covered in this site but i assume i must also account for vat for a customer based in the uk   so in answer to the original question a customer from canada which is currently outside the eu would account for the vat themselves and i would simply charge the gross amount

a falling exchange rate is an indication of falling confidence in a currency   countries like iran or venezuela with a managed exchange rate set their exchange rates at a higher value than the market accepts such market expectations may be influenced by poor government management interventions into markets such as businesses or general instability scarcity the governments act to manage that uncertainty by limiting the availability of foreign exchange and pegging the exchange rate    since there is an inadequate supply of trusted foreign currency people turn to informal exchanges in order to hedge their currency risk   this creates a negative feedback loop   people in government who have access to foreign exchange start to trade on informal markets pocketing the difference in the official and unofficial rates   the increasing gap between the two rates drives increasing informal market exchange and can result in speculative bubbles driving instability or economic contradiction is that the massive and increasing difference between the official and market exchange rates becomes a powerful form of rent for government officials this drives further state led rent seeking behaviour and causes the economy to become even more unstable if you 're interested in a more formal academic study of how such parallel markets in currency arise zimbabwe ’s black market for foreign exchange by albert at the university of is a useful source

the big difference is that you get your money earlier at the start suppose you start on a random day with payday on the last day of the month monthly or on every 2nd wednesday biweekly and it takes 3 days for payroll to ramp up ie if payday is within 3 days on your start date your next paycheck is not on the next payday but on the one after if we assume every month has 30 days to keep things simple it is an average of 4 + days until you get your first paycheck with monthly pay an average of days for weekly it is a bit trickier assuming you get hired at a random date here with being a time until you get paid an average of 10.5 days so you get your first pay an average of 8 days earlier later on that 3 day thing no longer occurs and now the company holds an average of 6.5 days of your pay due to you with biweekly paychecks and about 14.5 days with weekly paychecks if you have monthly pay so with monthly pay on average your bank account has 8 fewer days of   your pay in it at all times   this happens when   you are first hired and persists over the length of your employment now suppose you save that extra money on average suppose you have an investment at 4 after inflation   over 40 years those 8 days of pay invested at 4 grow to 38 days of pay a free month what more if the company has problems making payroll you 'll get a warning to say look for another job an average of 8 days sooner and/or have the money in your account   having someone owe you money is usually worse than having the money in your bank account

for a retail investor who is n't a physics or math major the beta of the stock is probably the best way to quantify risk   examples a beta of 1 means that a stock moves in line with the market over 1 means that you would expect the stock to move up or down faster than the market as a whole under 1 means that you would expect the stock to move slower than the market as a whole

ianal i am married to someone in your situation as a us citizen age 26 who has not had any contact with the irs you should most definitely be worried as a us citizen you are and always have been required to file a us tax return and pay any tax on all income no matter where earned and no matter where you reside   there are often but not always agreements between governments to reduce double taxation   the us rule as to whether a particular type of income is taxable will prevail as a us citizen with financial accounts chequing saving investment etc above a minimum balance abroad you are required to report information including the amounts in the account to the us government annually look up fbar   failure to file these forms carries harsh penalties a recent law fatca requires foreign financial institutions to report information on their us citizen clients to the us irrespective of any local banking privacy laws   it 's possible that your application triggered these reporting requirements you will not be allowed to renounce your us citizenship until you have paid all past us taxes and penalties good new   you are eligible in ten years or so to run for president do n't believe any of this or that nothing has been missed you must consult with a local tax expert specializing in us uk tax laws

there 's a few different types of investments you could do as mentioned you could split your money between the vanguard all world ex us and vanguard total stock market index a similar approach would be to invest in the vanguard total world stock etf you would n't have to track separate fund performances at the downside of not being able to allocate differential amounts to the us and non us markets vanguard will allocate them by market cap you could consider investing in country specific broad market indices like the s&p 500 and ftse 100 while not as diversified as the world indices they are more correlated with the country 's economic outlook other common investing are investing in companies which have historically paid out high dividends and companies that are under valued by the market but have good prospects for future growth this gets in the domain of value investing which an entire field by itself like andrew mentioned investing in a mutual fund is hassle free however mutual fees commissions and taxes can be higher somewhere in the range than index funds etf expense ratios typically < 0.50 so they would have to outperform the market by a bit to break even there are quite a few good books out there to read up about investing i 'd recommend the intelligent investor and millionaire teacher to understand the basics of long term investing but of course there are many other equally good books too

if the call is in the money and you believe the reason for the price jump was an overreaction with a on the horizon or you anticipate downward movement for other reasons i will roll sometimes for a strike closer to at the money as long as the trade results in a net credit    you already have the statistical edge trading covered calls over everyone who purchased stock at the same point in time   this is because covered calls reduce your cost basis and increase your probability of profit for people reading this who are not interested in the math behind probability of for covered calls you should be aware of why pop is higher for covered calls cc   with ccs you win when the stock price stays the same you win when it goes down slightly you win when the stock goes up   you have two more ways to win than someone who just buys stock therefore a higher probability of making a buck another option if your stock is going to be called at a loss or the strike you want to roll to results in a net debit or   your cash funds are short of owning 100x shares and you are familiar with the stock try writing a naked put for the price you want to buy at   at if the naked put is exercised your basis is reduced by the premium of the put you sold and you can write a covered call against the stock you now own   if it expires worthless you keep the premium   this is also another way to increase your pop

this is a tough question because it is something very specific to your situation and finances i personally started at a young age 17 with us$ 1,000 in scottrade i tried the stock market games at first but in retrospect they did nothing for me and turned out to be a waste of time i really started when i actually opened my brokerage account so step one would be to choose your discount broker for example scottrade ameritrade my current broker e trade charles schwab etc do n't worry about researching them too much as they all offer what you need to start out you can always switch later but this can be a little of a hassle for me once i opened my brokerage account i became that much more motivated to find a stock to invest in so the next step and the most important is research there are many good resources on the internet there can also be some pretty bad ones here 's a few i found useful investopedia they offer many useful easy to understand explanations and definitions i found myself visiting this site a lot cnbc that was my choice for business news i found them to be the most while being very informative fox business seems to be more political and just annoying to watch bloomberg news was just boring on cnbc jim cramer was a pretty useful resource his show mad money is entertaining and really does teach you to think like an investor i want to note though i do n't recommend buying the stocks he recommends specially the next day after he talks about them instead really pay attention to the reasons he gives for his recommendation it will teach you to think more like an investor and give you examples of what you should be looking for when you do research you can also use many online news organizations like marketwatch the motley fool yahoo finance has some pretty good resources and read editorial opinions articles with a grain of salt but again in each editorial they explain why they think the way they think

i agree that high volatility just means the underlying stock price fluctuates more and it does not imply if the stock is going up or down but a high volatility in the price of an underlying also means that there is a higher chance that the underlying price could reach extreme prices albeit in either direction however if you purchased a call option then if the underlying price reached an extremely high value then you will be rewarded but if the underlying price reached an extremely low value you wo n't lose any more than the initial premium that you paid there is no additional risk on your side it 's capped to the premium that you paid for the call option it 's this asymmetric outcome heads i win tails i do n't lose combined with high volatility that means that call options will increase in value when the underlying price becomes more volatile if the optionality was n't there then the price would n't be related to the volatility of the underlying but that would be called a future or a forward

if you want to invest in the stock market whether over a shorter period of 1 to 2 years or over a longer period of 10 or 20 years or longer you need to take some precautions and have a written investment plan with a risk management strategy incorporated in your plan others have said that 1 to 2 years is too short to invest in the stock market as the stock market can have a correction and fall by 50 but it does n't matter if you invest for 1 year or if you invest for 50 years the stock market can still fall by 50 just before you plan to withdraw your funds what you need to figure out is a way to get out before the market falls by 40 to 50 a simple way to do this is to use technical indicators to warn you when a market trend is starting to change and that it is time to get out of the market two simple indicators you can use on a market index are the rate of change roc indicator and the 100 week moving average ma below is a 10 year weekly chart of the s&p500 with these two indicators charted they show good times to get into the market and good times to get out   if you are using the 100 week ma you would buy in when the price crosses above the ma line and sell when the price crosses below the ma line if you are using the roc indicator you would buy in when the roc indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the roc indicator crosses below the zero line so your investment plan could be to buy an index etf representing the s&p500 when the roc moves above zero and sell when it crosses below zero you can also place a trailing stop loss of 10 to protect you in case of a sudden fall over a couple of days you can manage your investments in as little as 10 minutes per week by checking the chart once per week and adjusting your stop loss order   if you want to progressively add to your investment each month you could check the charts and only add any new funds if both the roc is above zero and sloping upwards another option for adding new funds could be if the price is above the ma and moving further away from the ma all these rules should be incorporated into your investment plan so that you are not basing your decisions based on emotions there are many other technical analysis indicators you could also learn about to make better educated decisions about your stock market investments however what i have provided here is enough for anyone to test over different indexes and time frames and do their own paper trading on to gain some confidence before placing any real money on the table

in the us a private company with less than 500 owners can dictate who can or ca n't become a shareholder this is true in general but i 'm sure there are loopholes    prior to google 's ipo i could not buy shares in google at any price    the reason google was forced to go public is the 500 shareholder rule    at a high level with 500 shareholders the company is forced to do some extra financial accounting and they no longer can control who owns a share of the company allowing me to purchase shares of google at that point   at that point it typically becomes in the companies best interest to go public see this article about google approaching the 500 shareholder limit in 2003 further is not quite correct that securities laws mandate that the company go public if by go public we mean list on a stock exchange available for general purchase    securities laws mandate what has to be reported in financial reporting and when you have to report it securities laws also can dictate restrictions on ownership of stock and if a company can impose their own restrictions a group of investors can not force a company onto a stock exchange    if shares of facebook are already for sale to anyone then having > 500 shareholders will force facebook to file more paperwork with the sec it wo n't force facebook onto the nyse or nasdaq    when that point is reached it may be in facebook 's best interest to have an ipo but they will not be required by law to do so update   cnn article discusses likely facebook ipo in 2012 when companies have more than 500    shareholders they 're required to make    significant financial disclosures    though they can choose to remain    private and keep their stock from    trading publicly however most    companies facing mandatory disclosures    opt to go public the securities and exchange commission    gives businesses lots of time to    prepare for that milestone companies    have until 120 days after the end of    the fiscal year in which they cross    the line to begin    making their disclosures if facebook    tips the scale this year that gives    it until april 2012 to start filing    financial reports

it is not wasted it bought you peace of mind perhaps you would have had peace of mind without it because of the particular industry you are in but people from any industry can get sick or give birth and not all industries are as as people think a number of my programmer colleagues now drive a truck or run a farm because new programming jobs were n't as easy to get as they once were like any insurance it ca n't be affordable if it is bought only by those who think they will need it the premiums you pay in addition to giving you peace of mind lower the premiums your neighbours pay that contributes to social harmony when your neighbours collect ei while looking for another job they are n't tempted to turn to crime or legal but not ways to earn money you probably like that too the fact they did n't get to choose whether or not to contribute means that they will be covered even if they are n't prudent and forward looking people which again is a benefit for you and btw employers pay $ 1.40 in premiums for every dollar you pay and we never collect it 's not for us but we pay it

am i wrong   yes the exchanges are most definitely not good ole boys clubs they provide a service a huge liquid and very fast market and they want to be paid for it additionally since direct participants in their system can cause serious and expensive disruptions they allow only organizations that know what they 're doing and can pay for any damages the cause is there a way to invest without an intermediary certainly but if you have to ask this question it 's the last thing you should do typically such offers are only superior to people who have large investments sums and know what they 're doing as an inexperienced investor chances are that you 'll end up losing everything to some fraudster honestly large exchanges have become so cheap e.g. xetra costs eur + per trade that if you 're actually investing then exchange fees are completely irrelevant the only exception may be if you want to use a dollar cost averaging strategy and do n't have a lot of cash every month fixed fees can be significant then many banks offer investments plans that cover this case

here is the answer from my brokerage regular equity monthly options expire on the 3rd friday of every month the last time to trade them is by market close at 4 pm eastern time the weekly options will expire on the friday of that week also with a last trading time of 4 pm eastern time options that expire in the money by .01 or more are automatically exercised if you are long an option that is out of the money at expiration it will expire worthless if you are short an option even if it expires out of the money you are still at risk for possible assignment since the long option holder always has the right to exercise an option prior to expiration

the idea that you should pay $ 5,000 up front to convert your shares and sell them to ultimately receive some larger amount is crazy if in fact the shares need to be converted unlikely they should be able to deduct the fees from the proceeds of your transaction and you would not be out of pocket anything at all you did n't provide much in numbers so i will make some up for example   if you have 2,000 shares valued at $ 10 each your account should be worth $ 20,000 if the liquidation cost is $ 5,000 they should be able to sell everything deduct the liquidation cost and send you a check for $ 15,000 you should not have to pay money up front to get your own money and that is a sure sign of a scam    if the liquidation cost is $ 5,000 they should be able to sell everything deduct the liquidation cost and send you a check for $ 15,000 you should not have to pay money up front to get your own money and that is a sure sign of a scam

security eugene kaspersky has declared cyber warfare as the internet 's greatest threat kaspersky believes that cyber warfare has over threats such as cyber crime and privacy issues to become the most dangerous issue facing the web he spoke at the australian convention about the potential damage of cyber super weapons and the future of internet security cyber weapons can damage a physical object as badly as a traditional weapon kaspersky was quoted as saying during his presentation in sydney it is a realistic scenario against any country because we all have the same systems all it takes is the wrong people with the right motives while both the public and private sector have been scrambling in recent years to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks experts have suggested that most hypothetical attacks would likely be limited in scope to a local or regional scale kaspersky argues that the only way to prevent a catastrophic series of attacks in the future would be for countries to come together and sign international against the use of cyber weapons i 'm afraid that there 's only one way that they can be protected and that 's international agreements against cyber weapons same as was done with nuclear weapons chemical weapons and biological weapons kaspersky said both china and the us showed positive signs for peace when they held cyber security earlier this year in a sign of solidarity during his speech kaspersky pointed to the stuxnet virus as a barometer for the power of cyber warfare the highly sophisticated virus successfully infected iran 's nuclear programme and is believed to have caused critical damage to uranium enrichment equipment

1 do n't trade individual stocks you expose yourself to unnecessary risk 2 pick a fund with low expenses that pays a dividend reinvest the dividend back into the fund   to quote einstein the greatest power on earth is compound interest   something is wrong with the software of the site it will not allow me to answer mark with another comment so i have to edit this answer to be able to answer him   no i am not hoping the price will go up the price is only relevant in comparison to the dividend it is the dividend that is important not the price the price is irrelevant if you never sell dividend paying securities are what you buy and hold then you reinvest the dividend and buy more of the security as i am buying the security with the dividend i am actually surprised when the price goes down when the price goes down but the dividend remains the same i am able to buy more shares of the security that dividend so if the price goes down and the dividend remains the same it is a good thing   again the site will not allow me to add another comment i profit from my investment without selling by receiving the dividend i used to be a speculator trying to get ahead of the market by buy low sell high but all that did was make money for the broker i lost as much as i gained trying to do that the broker made money on each transaction regardless if i did or not it took me decades to learn the lesson that buy and hold of dividend paying securities is the way to go do n't make my mistake i now get at least 5.5 yeald on my investment look at pgf which forms the backbone of my investments that is almost 0.5 per month each month that dividend is reinvested into pgf with no commission you ca n't beat that with a stick

the s&p 500 is an index this refers to a specific collection of securities which is held in perfect proportion the dollar value of an index is scaled arbitrarily and is based off of an arbitrary starting price side note this is why an index never has a split lets look at what assumptions are included in the pricing of an index all securities are held in perfect proportion this means that if you invest $ 100 in the index you will receive shares of ibm shares of general motors etc also if a security is added dropped from the list you are immediately rebalancing the remaining money zero commissions are charged when the index is calculated they are using the current price last trade of the underlying securities they are not actually purchasing them therefore it assumes that securities may be purchased without commission or other liquidity costs also closely related is the following the current price has full liquidity if the last quoted price is $ 20 for a security the index assumes that you can purchase an arbitrary amount of the security at that price with a counterparty that is willing to trade dividends are distributed immediately if you own 500 equities and most distributed dividends quarterly this means you will receive on average 4 dividends per day management is free all equities can be purchased with zero research and administrative costs there is no gains tax trading required by the assumptions above would change your holdings constantly and you are exempt from short term or long term capital gains taxes each one of these assumptions is of course invalid and the fund which endeavors to track the index must make several decisions in how to closely track the index while avoiding the problems costs caused by the assumptions these are shortcuts or each shortcut leads to performance which does not exactly match the index management fees fees are charged to the investor as load annual fees and/or redemptions securities are purchased at real prices if facebook were removed from the s&p 500 overnight tonight the fund would sell its shares at the price buyers are bidding the next market day at this could be significantly different than the price today which the index records securities are purchased in blocks rather than buying shares of general motors each time someone invests a dollar they wait for a few people and then buy a full share or a round lot securities are substituted with lots of analysis it may be determined that two stocks move in tandem the fund may purchase two shares of general motors rather than one of general motors and ford this halves transaction costs debt is used as part of substitution equities may be replaced by options option pricing shows that ownership of options is equivalent to holding an amount of debt other forms of leverage may also be employed to achieve desired market exposure see also beta   dividends are bundled vfinx the largest s&p 500 tracking fund pays dividends quarterly rather than immediately as earned the dividend money which is not paid to you is either deployed to buy other securities or put into a sinking fund for payment there are many reasons why you ca n't get the actual performance quoted in an index and for other more exotic indices like vix the volatility index even more so the best you can do is work with someone that has a good reputation and measure their performance

no the dividends ca n't be exploited like that dividends settlement are tied to an ex dividend date the ex dividend is the day that allows you to get a dividend if you own the stock since a buyer of the stock after this date wo n't get the dividend the price usually drop by the amount of the dividend in your case the price of a share would lose $ 2.65 and you will be credited by $ 2.65 in cash such that your portfolio wo n't change in value due to the dividend also you ca n't exploit the drop in price by short selling as you would be owing the dividend to the person lending you the stock for the short sale finally the price of the stock at the ex dividend will also be affected by the supply and demand such that you ca n't be precisely sure of the drop in price of the security

the answer to your question is no your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full   the fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating while the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance they are also not spending a lot of money on you nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts   the transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit   that is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer   they are happy with your arrangement the formula for credit rating computation is proprietary but we know what the factors are overall   making payments on time consistently is a positive not a negative factor   however they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt   for example if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage that could possibly be a negative   if you have opened some of those accounts recently it could be a negative   if you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good that could be a negative there are other things as well that could be bringing your score down   probably worth it to take a look if you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score i 'd encourage you to visit creditkarma.com or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating

yup it 's totally legit and it is not a money market account though interest rates are so low across the board this is about as high as savings accounts get and so it is called a high yield savings account a number of banks offer these there are different offerings nation wide versus local state i would use this compare tool at to find them and the blog is very good with updates and trends here are some well advertised accounts if you do n't already have a rewards checking account get one of those first will direct you to these as well a reasonable interest rate on rewards checking is 2.5 and up so much better the only catches are reasonable online statements direct deposit or autopay and use your debit card 10 or 12 times a month for any transaction amount groceries coffee gas easy the other major thing i would consider when opening any account is where you live and the current accounts you have if you have an amex card already just use their savings account that way you have unified accounts faster transfers your personal information is n't spread thinly around all different banks you have more leverage with the company as a long standing customer etc as far as using a bank in the state where you live it simplifies taxes two more things i would always choose a credit union over a bank and many have excellent rewards checking accounts if you use mint yodlee or other financial software make sure the potential new bank with that service

i switched to the buy side here is some things you should do   first of all you already had 6 interviews   i would say the hr people are going to be less helpful because its harder to differentiate yourself   if you are talking to an investment portfolio and they ask you any of type of   what are you interested in how did you get into this space   you better have multiple stock pitches lined up   for example on the the first question   i 'm interested in im because i was exposed at an early age by my parents   although i did n't know what i was doing i kept following stock 1 you 're first crack in the   more about your background stuff   in fact stock 1 turned out to be one of my best worst trades   i thought it was going here and it went there due to this and that and etc info about stock 1   now i like to look at names such as stock 2 5 because they are show this multiple or that yield or these depending on who you are talking to   that is how you get a job through an informational interview     as for how you get an informational interview   go run through linkedin   sort for investment management   any person you have a 2nd degree network or group network is fair game   just shoot your common friend an email hey what s up i saw you were friends with x i 'm really interested in his company can you put me in touch   although the end person may never respond the connection is like almost guaranteed to help assuming you 're a nice friendly person   recruiting for im is a full time job   even other industries as well   my roommate graduated business undergrad program top 3 in the country in two years not 2 letters and science + 2 business but 2 total years at 19 years old took him a full year of recruiting and paying his own way out to ny to meet people to land an banking job due to similar circumstances as he was fully out of school and was n't in the normal rotation   what really concerns me is you keep saying analysis   it makes me think that you have no clue what you want to do   tell me what analysis means   if you want to recruit for im you better be watching the markets everyday esp if you are unemployed have opinions on lots of companies etc

i find that when i have to justify why i want something to someone else i eliminate impulse buys because i have to think about it enough to explain to someone else why it is desirable simply going through that process in my own head in advance of a conversation to justify it i talk myself out of a lot of purchases i 'm married so i have these conversations with my wife she is very supportive of me buying things that i want if they will bring value if i was n't married and could n't control my spending i 'd find a good friend or relative that i trust and i would create a trust with me as the primary beneficiary and i would appoint a trustee who was willing to sign off on any purchase that i wanted to make after justifying it to them if i had no friends or relatives that i trusted in that role i 'd hire a financial adviser to fill the same role contractually i would want to be able to terminate the arrangement if it was not working but that would mean sacrificing the legal fees to alter the trust and appoint a new trustee

this line of thinking is wrong   you do n't control time you control place   the secret to winning is to always be out there   if you 're constantly 24/7 selling your wares you 're going to get lucky and make a few great sales   being at the right place at the right time means always being in new and different places until you hit the right time   this is why food trucks do so well   you travel until you hit the right place at the right time   you can call this luck   sure to some degree it is   but the real secret is just to work harder and longer than everyone else   that 's how you get lucky

yes if the deceased owned the policy the proceeds are considered part of the estate in the specific case where the estate is worth this year 2011 more than $ 5 m there may be estate taxes due and the insurance would be prorated to pay its portion of that estate tax bill   keep in mind the estate tax itself is subject to change i recall when it was a simple $ 1 m exemption and if i had a $ 1 m policy and just say $ 100 k in assets there would have been tax due on the $ 100k. in general if there 's any concern that one 's estate would have the potential to owe estate tax it 's best to have the insurance owned by the beneficiary and gift them the premium cost each year

the number one reason to borrow is quite simple when you have no other choice the primary reason to do this is when renovations or additions must be made in a timeframe that precludes you being able to save enough money to pay cash 's example of a kid on the way with no space to put him is a very good hypothetical disaster recovery is another insurance does n't cover everything and can sometimes be slow to pay out and even if the payoff will rebuild the house exactly the way it was these situations are good opportunities to improve on what you had since you already have to call in the contractors to demo and rebuild the cost to do that is sunk and the incremental cost of improvements or even additional square footage is relatively minor other acceptable reasons to borrow are when cost of capital is very cheap a typical amortized heloc is pretty expensive when paid on schedule but if you can pay it off very early i.e. when you sell the home next month or you get a good deal on the interest rate a subsidized disaster recovery loan perhaps you have to be careful with these as they 're not intended to turn a burnt down into a mcmansion the cost of borrowing can be acceptable even if you had cash savings for the project you have other uses for the cash that can offset cost of borrowing this generally requires the first point to be true as well as it 's a general rule that borrowing $ 10,000 costs you more than you would gain by investing $ 10,000 but there are situations in which the reverse can be true if you have $ 10k in oil or major tech stocks right now it would probably be a bad move to liquidate them for home improvements if you can get a heloc at less than 6 you can realize a net gain in home value from the reno these situations are rare in cases of an already livable home flippers which make their living on renovating homes for a profit generally choose homes with obvious but easy to fix problems that depress home value because they look worse than they are if you bought your home without any such problems you probably paid something close to market value at the time and so you 're probably behind the curve however if you or your family in the case of an estate transfer have owned the home for a long time long enough for things to fall way out of date then you can catch up a lot of market value with one renovation where if the home had had two or three renovations along the way a reno now would n't gain you as much value

the whole notion that a central banker must be independent of the government force is insane no this is precisely borne out as i posted above by dozens of economies over hundreds of years here is but one study from demonstrating this quite clearly unless you have some peer reviewed evidence then let 's note your opinion as such and move on   letting politicians dictate monetary policy has been terrible where it has been tried for the reasons i gave above letting a politician print money makes that politician get votes but leads to massive inflation and unemployment your ignorance of actual evidence and cries to nationalize the fed will most likely work out much worse than the current system as demonstrated many times in research including the above

hmm looking at the macro economy hoarding money will decrease the monetary supply so the fed will offset that with increases to the monetary supply to achieve target interest rates   which will lead to higher inflation hurting your savings minus debt   exactly what 's going on in the rest of the economy   for investment sake ca n't you find something with at least some sort of return rather than getting nothing with physical currency

the key word you forgot to include from slide 29 is free riding investopedia defines free riding as in the context of a brokerage firm a free rider problem refers to a situation where a client has been allowed to purchase shares without actually paying for them and then subsequently sells the shares ideally for profit the problem with this scenario is that the client if allowed to free ride can profit from a stock trade without actually using any of his or her own capital this is illegal i have not heard of any issues with this type of action being a problem with trading accounts in australia nor have i been able to find any such rules on the asx website or any of by brokers websites so i think this may be an issue in the usa but not australia you should check the rules in any other countries you wish to trade in

in my experience any kind of equity you may be offered by the company is just a carrot your offer may be written in such a way that your potential ownership represents say 1 of the company today but if the company goes for a round of financing your ownership percentage can get diluted if this happens a couple of times and the terms of financing are n't very favorable then your percentage can go from that 1 down to 0.001 making the equity worthless i 've known people who heard their company was being bought and thought they might get some kind of payoff come to find out the company had n't done all that well and there was n't anything to pay out after the main investors got some money back the main investors took a loss for obvious reasons management was n't keeping the staff up to date about the fact that they were operating in the red and their options were worthless some people about lawyers and filing lawsuits but at the end of the day there was n't any money to be won keep this in mind as to your question regarding what to look out for

a security is a class of financial instrument you can trade on the market   a share of stock is a kind of security for example as is a bond in the case of your mortgage what happens you take out a loan for $ 180k   the loan has two components a.   the payment stream meaning the principal and the interest from the loan b.   the servicing of the loan meaning the company who is responsible for accepting payments giving the resulting income to whomever owns it many originating banks such as my initial lender do neither of these things they sell the payment stream to a large bank or consortium often fannie mae and they also sell the servicing of the loan to another company the payment stream is the primary value here the servicing is worth essentially a tip off the top   the originating bank lends $ 180k of their own money   then they have something that is worth some amount say $ 450k total value $ 15k per year for 30 years and they sell it for however much they can get for it   the actual value of $ 15k year for 30 years is somewhere in between less than $ 450k more than $ 180k since there is risk involved and the present value is far less   the originating bank has the benefit of selling that they can then originate more mortgages and make money off the fees plus they can reduce their risk exposure then a security is created by the bigger bank where they take a bunch of mortgages of different risk levels and group them together to make something with a very predictable risk   very similar to insurance really except the other way around   one mortage will either default or not at some chance but it 's a one off thing any good statistician will tell you that you do n't do statistics on   one hundred mortgages each with some risk level will very consistently return a particular amount within a certain error and thus you have something that people are willing to pay money on the market for

based on your description of what you were given then you should not need to contact dmv dot however if you are not comfortable with that answer then contact visit the dealer you can ask them how long it normally takes and do you pick up the real plates at the dealer dmv or will they be mailed to you also call them if the temporary plates will run out in a few days to make sure everything is good to go one other note if the dealer is in one state and you live in another they can give you temporary plate for their state but may not be able to file for the real plates in your state once everything is finalized go online to dmv and make sure that the car registration is ok a few years ago the dealer gave me real plates they gave me a registration good for two years but the info sent to dmv was corrupted the vin was in the system but the description was wrong and the plates were listed as none this was only noticed when i tried to re register the car two years later in fact according to dmv the plates on the car were listed as never issued if i had ever been pulled over it would have taken hours to resolve

gt;how can one argue plastic 's inability to store value comes artificially by opinion   that 's backwards gold 's ability to store value is artificial plastic 's value is naturally determined by the market it 's cheap to produce and abundant therefore the market dictates it 's going to be cheap   gold is artificially priced because it still retains many of its characteristics as a store of value for things unrelated to itself people for example invest in gold bullion driving up the price it 's abundant though costly to produce yet its quantity and cost of production do n't determine its price investors do   you do n't see people investing in plastic bars

investopedia has this note where you 'd want the point the interest rate commonly about by the media has a wide and    varied impact upon the economy when it is raised the general effect    is a lessening of the amount of money in circulation which works to    keep inflation low it also makes borrowing money more expensive    which affects how consumers and businesses spend their money this    increases expenses for companies lowering earnings somewhat for those    with debt to pay finally it tends to make the stock market a    slightly less attractive place to investment as for evidence i 'd question that anyone could really take out all the other possible economic influences to prove a direct co relation between the federal funds rate and the stock market returns   for example of the dozens of indices that are stock related which ones would you want that evidence total market large cap small cap value stocks growth stocks tech utilities reits etc   this is without considering other possible investment choices such as direct real estate holdings compared to reits that is precious metals and collectibles that could also be used

i started looking at this yesterday after seeing a fb ad in reading the agreements it appears they are n't the fdic insured entity but rather they hold your money with an fdic bank who is their partner what i could n't tell is if they have one large account that they hold your money in commingled and i 'd suspect far exceeding the $ 250,000 fdic limit or if it 's individual accounts in your own name being held there and beam is the intermediary   what i 'm guessing is beam is actually owned by this partner bank and that bank is using this as a way to raise funds to fuel their loan growth in much higher rate areas such as commercial lending this is probably why they are capping the amount of new users so they can throttle the deposit influx until they 've lent it out the 2 rate paid to depositors is cheaper than going to the bond market

also vw has more brands i.e. is more diversified this is n't necessarily a good thing for investing   it makes the company less likely to go down but it limits your portfolio   for example say you think that hyundai is a good alternative to volkswagen vw but really like audi   if you buy vw you get some audi but a lot more of the rest of vw   then if you bought hyundai you 'd be in that segment of the market    audi may not be structured uniquely but it is still the only company selling audi brand cars   perhaps someone thinks that those models will do well   that person may think that audi will do exceptionally well in its niche    having many brands is n't necessarily great   general motors had something like sixteen brands before declaring bankruptcy   it only has twelve now    now it sounds like you feel the opposite about it   you do n't particularly like audi as a stock and like vw better   your reasons sound perfectly reasonable i know little about either company   it may even be that vw is the only one buying audi stock because everyone else has the same view as you
