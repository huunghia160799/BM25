there are specific cases where you are required to use ads required use of ads    you must use ads for the following property listed property used 50 or less in a qualified business use see chapter 5 for information on listed property any tangible property used predominantly outside the united states during the year any tax exempt use property any tax exempt bond financed property all property used predominantly in a farming business and placed in service in any tax year during which an election not to apply the    uniform capitalization rules to certain farming costs is in effect any property imported from a foreign country for which an executive order is in effect because the country maintains trade    restrictions or engages in other discriminatory acts see publication if none of those apply to your property you may elect ads why would you elect ads when you 're not required to use it if you ca n't think of a reason then do n't elect it for most people the shorter the depreciation period the more they can deduct or accumulate in passive losses each year and that is usually the desirable case if you plan on selling in 10 years keep in mind the depreciation recapture and consider whether the passive losses offsetting regular income are worth the extra tax in this case

gt it 's been years since my finance classes but it seems to me the best course of action after selling the property and paying corporate taxes would be to reinvest the money at the corporate level to then pay out dividends rather than pay each of the 3 shareholders out and have us then pay personal tax on a large amount   full disclaimer no one here is or is acting in capacity as a tax accountant or lawyer    my understanding is as follows assuming you 're in the us   1 the c corp owns the property if you sell the property the corporation will receive the proceeds of that sale if a capital gain is recognized the corporation will pay the appropriate tax rate that rate is apparently the same as normal income    2 if you then issue a dividend with the proceeds of that sale you are actually not reinvesting the proceeds you 're distributing them to shareholders shareholders will then need to pay tax on the dividends at their personal rates as income   if you reinvest the cash it will stay in the business it will not go directly to shareholders the cash will need to be invested somewhere else within the company you will get hit with taxes regardless at least once if you distribute to shareholders those proceeds will be taxed twice    example   both cases   sale proceeds $ 100   less corporate tax of 35 $ 35   after tax proceeds $ 65     if distributed   distributed to shareholders $ 65   less income taxes at 25 $   after tax distribution to shareholders $     if retained   no distributions   retained earnings + $ 65   cash + $ 65   book value of equity + $ 65   shareholder wealth increase $ 65

because stock markets do n't always go up sometimes they go down sometimes they go way down between 2007 and 2009 the s&p 500 lost over half its value so if in 2007 you thought you had just enough to retire on in 2009 you 'd suddenly find you had only half of what you needed of course over the next few years many of the stocks recovered value but if you had retired in 2008 and depended on a 401k that consisted entirely of stocks you 'd have been forced to sell a bunch of stocks near the bottom of the market to cover your retirement living expenses bonds go up and down too but usually not to the same extent as stocks and ideally you are n't selling the bonds for your living expenses just collecting the interest that 's due you for the year of course some companies and cities went bankrupt in the 2008 crisis too and they stopped making interest payments   another risk is that you may be forced to retire before you were actually planning to as you age you are at increasing risk for medical problems that may force an early retirement many businesses with the 2008 recession by laying off their older workers who were earning higher salaries it was n't an easy environment for older workers to find jobs in so many folks were forced into early retirement nothing is risk free so you need to make an effort to understand what the risks are and decide which ones you are comfortable with

chris this is an arbitrage question with a twist you can not treat the location you want to live objectively for example why not instead of texas yes 's expensive but what if you account for the weather this question is very interesting for me personally something i am going to focus on myself soon as well to the question at hand it 's very hard to get a close estimate of the price from a single source say a website the cost of a house is always negotiable and there 's no sticker price and there begins your problems however there are some publicly available information which websites aggregate see also some might help rent is at least as expensive as the monthly mortgage property taxes hoa fees etc smart people have told me this and this also makes sense to me as the landlord is in this business to make some money after all however there are also other hidden costs of home ownership that i am not aware of in details and which i in my etc above that could put a rental to be cheaper one example that comes to mind is you as a tenant get to complain if the washer dryer and demand the landlord get you a new one see how you would n't make a sound were you to own it however such a website to gauge rentals houses cost more where the median income is more again you can not be objective about this because smart people like to live around smart people and pay for the privilege turn again to to get this information better weather is more expensive than not so good weather in the article you linked notice the ratio of homes in california yes i know of people who sold off their family ranches in vancouver and seattle to buy homes in orange country in short there is a lot of information you would have to gather from multiple sources and even then never be sure that you did your best this also includes arbitrage as you would like to come out ahead and while you are doing your research and paying your rent you want to invest your savings in instruments where you earn more than what you would have saved in a mortgage etc i would very much like to be refuted on every point and my answer be edited and made better as i need the same answers as you do feel free to comment edit your question etc and i will act on feedback and help both of us and future readers out

one topic that i 've been trying to learn more about is the affects of the low interest rates on businesses and the economy from quantitative easing due to the amount of free money corporations have received over the last 5 years there has been a few interesting consequences there are several corporations that have borrowed money at little to no interest with the feds intentions of seeing it go back into the economy however instead corporations have used it to buy back stock which was not necessarily the plan in the first place you could definitely have a unique thesis written about something within that flow of funds if that makes no sense apologies stupid undergrad here

a specific strategy to make money on a potentially moderately decreasing stock price on a dividend paying stock is to write covered calls   there is a category on money se about covered call writing but in summary a covered call is a contract to sell the shares at a set price within a defined time range you gain a premium called the time value which when i 've done it can be up to an additional return on the position   with this strategy you 're collecting dividends and come out with the best return if the stock price stays in the middle if the price does not shoot up high enough that your option is called you still own the stock and made extra return if the price drops moderately you may still be positive

outstanding principal balance is the amount you owe at any given time not including the amount of interest you need to pay as soon as possible the capitalized interest shown is consistent with an average of 13.5 months between when each dollar is borrowed and when the repayment period begins suppose you borrow the first half of the money on september 1 2017 and the second half of the money on february 1 2017 5 months later   at that point half the money has been accruing interest for 5 months   on january 1 2018 half the money accrued interest for 16 months and half the money accrued interest for 11 months   the lender now expects you to start repaying the loan with the first payment due at the end of january 2018 or the beginning of february 2018   if you make the minimum payments on time the lender expects you to make 120 monthly payments   the last monthly payment would be at the end of december or the beginning of january the lender or the website should provide details about the actual payment plan grace periods provisions for handling inability to pay due to unemployment and other terms in the united states most installment loans pretend that for purposes of calculating interest every month has 30 days even february and july   each month 1/12 of the annual percentage rate apr is charged as interest   if you do the compounding a 6.8 percent apr corresponds to 1 + 1 = percent annual percentage yield apy also the apr is understated   the 6.8 percent applies to the full balance including the loan fees even though the borrower only gets the amount minus the loan fees   the 6.8 percent rate is useful for doing calculations after the loan fees have been charged though   these calculations include the capitalized interest and the monthly payment amounts a true calculation of the apr would take the loan fees into account and give a higher number than 6.8 percent   but the corrected apr would not be useful for calculating the capitalized interest nor for calculating the monthly payment amounts

in theory investing is not gambling because the expected outcome is not random people are expecting positive returns on average with some relationship to risk undertaken and economic reality more risk = more returns historically this is true on average that assets have positive returns and riskier assets have higher returns also it 's true that stock market gains roughly track economic growth valuation current price level relative to fundamentals matters reversion to the mean does exist over a long enough time given a 7 10 year horizon a lot of the variance in ending price level can be explained by valuation at the start of the period on average over time business profits have to vary around a curve that 's related to the overall economy and equity prices should reflect business profits the shorter the horizon the more random noise even 1 year is pretty short in this respect bubbles do exist as do irrational panics and forms of each investing is not like a coin flip because the current total number of heads and tails current valuation does affect the probability of future outcomes that said it 's pretty hard to predict the timing or the specific stocks that will do well etc rebalancing gives you an objective automated way to take advantage of all the noise around the long term trend rather than trying to use judgment to identify when to get in and out with rebalancing and dollar cost averaging you guarantee getting in a bit more when things are lower and getting out a bit more when things are higher you can make money from prices bouncing around even if they end up going nowhere and even if you ca n't predict the bouncing here are a couple old posts from my blog that talk about this a little more

one key point that other answers have n't covered is that many credit cards have a provision where if you pay it off every month you get a grace period on the interest   interest does n't accrue at all unless you rollover a non zero balance   but if you do you pay interest on the average balance not the rolled over balance for the entire month you have to ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with your credit history are you trying to maximize your buying power really leverage   or are you trying to make sure that you get the best terms on a moderately sized loan house mortgage car note as johnfx and already noted it 's in the banker 's best interest to maximize the profit they make off of you   of course that is not in your best interest keeping a credit card balance from month to month definitely feeds the greedy nature of the financing beast   and makes them willing to take more risks because the returns are also higher   but those returns cost you if you are planning to get sensible loans in the future that you can comfortably afford you wo n't need a maxed credit score   you wo n't get the largest loan amounts but because you are doing the sensible thing and making a large down payment the risk is also very low and you 'll find lenders willing to give you a low interest rate   because even though the reward is lower than the compulsive purchaser who pays an order of magnitude more in financing fees the return risk ratio is still very favorable to the bank do n't play the game that maximizes their return   that happens when you have a loan of maximum size high interest rate and struggle to make payments end up missing a couple and paying late fees or request forbearance which compounds the interest play to minimize risk

paying off a loan early is n't a bad thing   having a credit card for 6 months and then closing it is probably unneeded pay it off and then keep it as an emergency card    the key is debt available credit ratio   look at this article for example which explains the different elements the only one you 're affecting here is the second your debt load   if you 're not planning on asking for another loan in the next six months none of this really matters assuming you are paying it off for sure in six months your debt will be gone and your credit score recovered from any hit it takes and if you get a $ 1500 credit card and only put $ 300 on it it might actually improve your credit but having an open $ 1500 credit card with a 0 balance will probably improve your credit rating unless you have a really high amount of available credit   it will improve your debt credit ratio ie total $ you owe divided by total $ you could put on your ccs revolving credit this is all aside from the is it a good idea to borrow money for a 3 month vacation before starting working which the answer is well not exactly   that 's not from a credit perspective just from a living within your means perspective   if you have a firm job that will easily pay off the vacation it 's probably not a bad thing but definitely a certain number of people will take this and end up in spending bad habits that last their life   be aware of that and if you 're just loaning yourself money from the future make sure you understand the terms of that loan and are certain you can pay it off

no they do not stock funds and bonds funds collect income dividends in different    ways stock funds collect dividends   as well as any capital gains    that are realized from the underlying stocks   and incorporates these    into the funds’ net asset value or daily share price that ’s why a    stock fund ’s share price drops when the fund makes a distribution    the distribution comes out of the fund ’s total net assets with bond funds the internal accounting is different   dividends    accrue daily and are then paid out to shareholders every month or    quarter   bond funds collect the income from the underlying bonds and    keep it in a separate internal bucket   a bond fund calculates a    daily accrual rate for the shares outstanding and shareholders only    earn income for the days they actually hold the fund   for example if    you buy a bond fund two days before the fund ’s month end distribution    you would only receive two worth of income that month   on the    other hand if you sell a fund part way through the month you will    still receive a partial distribution at the end of the month    pro rated for the days you actually held the fund source   also via bogleheads most vanguard bond funds accrue interest to the share holders daily    here is a typical statement from a prospectus each fund distributes to shareholders virtually all of its net income    interest less expenses as well as any net capital gains realized    from the sale of its holdings the fund ’s income dividends accrue    daily and are distributed monthly the term accrue used in this sense    means that the income dividends are credited to your account each day    just like interest in a savings account that accrues daily since the    money set aside for your dividends is both an asset of the fund and a    liability it does not affect the calculated net asset value when the    fund distributes the income dividends at the end of the month the net    asset value does not change as both the assets and liabilities    decrease by exactly the same amount note that if you sell all of    your bond fund shares in the middle of the month you will receive as    proceeds the value of your shares calculated as number of shares    times net asset value plus a separate distribution of the accrued    income dividends

i have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term because on average they go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future it has also been wrong for 20 + year time periods during those last 100 years it 's an average and you can live your whole career at a loss there are many things to support the retention of the average over the next 100 years i think the is out of scope of your actual investment philosophy but basically there are many ways to lower your cost basis by reinvesting dividends selling options or contributing to your position at any price from a portion of your income and by inflation and by the growth of the world economy with a low enough cost basis then a smaller percentage gain in the index gives you a magnified profit

inflation refers to the money supply think of all money being air in a balloon inflation is what happens when you blow more air in the balloon deflation is what happens when you let air escape inflation may cause prices to go up however there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen for example at the same time of inflation there might be unemployment making consumers unable to pay higher prices or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons war has ended etc compensating for the money having less value   similarly peoples wages will tend to rise over time they have to otherwise everyone would be earning less due to inflation however again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation or rise much faster in fact over the past 40 years or so us wages have not been able to keep up with inflation making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago at its core inflation refers to the value of the money itself as all values of other products services assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value this can quickly become very complex most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average joe 's spending pattern however these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation the hidden inflation may come back later to bite us

i do n't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others it does n't really matter much whether a company has shares selling for $ 100 each or 10,000,000 shares selling for $ 10 each either way the total value is the same companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount they can like if the price was $ 10,000 per share than an investor with less than $ 10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market if it 's $ 10 then if someone wants $ 10 they can buy one share and if someone wants $ 10,000 they can buy 1000 shares as to why energy stocks are volatile i can think of several reasons one in our current world energy is highly susceptible to politics a lot of the world 's energy comes from the middle east which is a notoriously unstable region any time there 's conflict there energy supplies from the region become uncertain oil producing countries may embargo countries that they do n't like a war will at the very least interfere with transportation and shipping and may result in oil wells being destroyed etc two energy is consumed when you use it and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile so you 're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it so if demand goes down it is reflected immediately compare this to say clothing most people expect to keep the same clothes for years wearing them repeatedly hopefully washing them now and then so if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four this might not have any immediate impact on your buying it could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway there is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts but with energy if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4 your consumption goes down immediately within days three really adding to number two energy is highly perishable especially some forms of energy if a solar power station is capable of producing 10 but today there is only demand for 9 you ca n't save the unused for some future time when demand is higher it 's gone you can charge a battery with it but that 's pretty limited you can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it but you ca n't save the output of a power plant note numbers two and three also apply to food which is why food production is also very volatile

sure user data is valuable but valuable enough to be their business model the math does n't add up   if the data is that valuable then why even charge users in the first place letting people in free would certainly generate even more data definitely more than what they would have gotten at their $ 10 price point if they get twice as many people to jump in at the free price level not a far fetched assumption then they would make enough additional money to justify giving it away   and after a certain point additional data stops being statistically significant while costs continue to mount paying for all those additional tickets   furthermore the ceo has already said that their business model is to share the additional revenue with the theaters   i 'm not saying that they wo n't mine their data they would be fools not to and they will definitely be able to monetize it but it 's not possible for that alone to be their business model how can it every time they send someone to a new movie it costs them the full ticket price

anyone can walk into a bank say hi i 'm a messenger i have an endorsed check and a filled out deposit slip for joe blow who has an account here please deposit this check for him as he is straight deposit   they 'll fiddle on their computer to see if they can identify the deposit account definitively and if they can and the check looks legit thanks for taking care of our customer sir   of course getting a balance or cashback is out of the question since you are not authenticated as the customer i have done the same with balance transfer paperwork in that case the bank knew the customer and the balance transfer was his usual if the friend does not have an account there then s he should maybe open an account at an online bank that allows deposit by snapping photos on a phone or phone up a branch describe her his situation and see if they have any options   alternately s he could get a paypal account   or get one of those credit card swipe on your phone deals like square or paypal here which have fees very close to nil normally cards are swiped but you can hand enter the numbers    those are fairly easy to get even if you have troubles with creditworthiness   s he would need to return the check to the payer and ask the payer to pay her him one of those ways   the payer may not be able to e.g. if they are a large corporation a last possibility is if the check is from a large corporation with whom s he continues to do business with   for instance the electric company cashiers out your account after you terminate service at your old location but then you provision service at a new location and get a new bill you can send their check right back to them and say please apply this to my new account if s he is unable to get any of those because of more serious problems like being in the country illegally then lawful behavior has its privileges sorry there are lots of unbanked people and they pay through the nose for banking services at those check cashing places at least in america   i do n't have a good answer for how to get a check cashed in that situation

as always with investments it depends on your risk adversity i do n't want to repeat the content of hundreds of recommendations here so just the nutshell for qualified investments the more risk you are willing to take the more returns you 'll get the upper end is the mutual funds and share market where you have long term expectations of 8 10 and corresponding risks of maybe + 50 per year the lower end is a cd where you can expect little to no interest corresponding to little to no risk investing in shares funds is not better than investing in cds it is different not everybody likes financial roller and some people mainly consider the high risk which gives them sleepless nights while others just consider the expected high long term gains as all that counts find out what your personal risk adversity is and then pick accordingly

assuming that no one else has hit the ask and the asks are still there yes you will fill $ as long as you did n't exhaust that ask actually there is no current price at which the stock is exchanging hands in reality it is the last price traded the somebody who negotiated prices between buyers sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids asks   the real negotiation comes between bids asks and if they meet or cross a trade occurs it 's not that both bid ask should be $ it 's that they were to answer the title the reasons why the bid and ask even their midpoint move away from the last price are largely unknown but at least for the market makers if their sell inventory is going away people are buying heavily and they 're running out of inventory they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall so with stocks that means having a balanced inventory of longs shorts   they want to sometimes have to depending on the exchange accommodate the buying pressure but they do n't want to lose money so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen in fact yahoo finance is great about showing this there 's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask   take a look at bac 's limit book you can see that there are many bids and many asks   if one ask is exhausted the next in line is now the highest   the market maker who just sold at x will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at to get an 11 return on investment

the short answer probably not much   unless you have a controlling interest in the company   if at least of the shareholder votes are in favor of the dilution then it can be done   there are some sec rules that should protect against corporate looting and theft like what the side is trying to make it appear as happened however it would appear that did something stupid   he signed away all of his voting right to someone who would use them to make his rights basically worthless   had he kept his head in the game he could probably have saved himself   but he did n't if your average startup started issuing lots of stock and devaluing existing shares significantly then i would expect it would be harder to find investors willing to watch as their investment dwindled   but if you are issuing a limited amount stock to get leverage to grow bigger then it is worth it   in the .com bubble there were quite a few companies that just issued stock to buy other companies   eventually most of these companies got delisted because they diluted them selves to much when they were overvalued any company not just a startup can dilute its shares   many if not most major companies issue stock to raise capital   this capital is then generally used to build the business further and increase the value of all shares   most of the time this dilution is very minor < .1 and has little if any impact on the stock   there are rules that have to be followed as listed companies are regulated by the sec   there are less regulations with private corporations   it looks like the dilution was combined with the buyout of the florida company which probably contributed to the legality of the dilution      with options they are generally issued at a set price   this may be higher or lower than the reported sell price of the stock when the option is issued   the idea is over time the stock will increase in value so that those people who hold on to their options can buy the stock for the price listed on the option   i worked at an isp start up in the 90 's that made it pretty well   i left before the options were issued but i had friends still there that were issued an option at $ 16 a share the value of the stock at the time of the issue of the option was about 12   well the company diluted the shares and used them to acquire more isp 's unfortunately this was about the time that dsl and cable internet took off so the dial up market tanked   the value eventually fell to .10 they did a reverse split and when they did the called in all options   the options did not have a positive cash value at any time   had ever made it big then the options could have been worth millions   there are some people from ms and yahoo that were in early that made millions off of their options   this became a popular way for startups to attract great talent paying peanuts   they invested their time in the business hoping to strike gold   a lot of it people got burned so this is less popular among top talent as the primary compensation anymore

good number of reviews compared to a study of 100 though it is nt normalized or in an actual study format the thing to note is that if you compare the types of employees to another tech company like lets say google alphabet or facebook you have a different distribution in the type of people recruited and that might effect their experience as well as severely skew the sample amazon does a lot of retail support and call centers as compared to a lot of engineers with a more educated background both are people but there s definitely a difference in the type of person as well as their temperament you get if you go to lets say an urban wal mart as compared to an alphabet or facebook engineer

this is not a problem swift does not need the beneficiary account currency the settlement account or the instruction amount is of interest to the banks as i understand your agreement with client is they pay you x eur that is what would be specified on the swift along with your details as beneficiary account number etc once the funds are received by your bank in turkey they will get eur when they apply these funds to your account in usd they will convert using the standard rates unless you are a large customer and have special instructions like do not credit if funds are received in non usd or give me a special rate or call me and ask me what i want to do etc it typically takes 3 5 days for an international wire depending on the countries and currencies involved wait for few more days and then if not received you have to ask your client to mention to his bank that beneficiary is claiming non receipt of funds the bank that initiated the transfer can track the wire not the your bank which is supposed to receive the funds

according to us news renter 's insurance does cover liability as well as your own belongings   they list this as one of four myths often about renter 's insurance   this is backed up by which explicitly mentions property damage to others as covered   nationwide insurance says that renter 's insurance covers personal liability insurance for renters and personal umbrella liability insurance   those were the first three working links for what does renters insurance cover on google    in short while it is possible that you currently have a different kind of coverage this is not a limitation of renter 's insurance per se   it could be a limitation in your current coverage   you may be able to simply change your coverage with your current provider   or switch providers   or you may already be covered    note that renter 's insurance does not cover the building against general damage e.g. or a fire spreading from an adjacent building   it is specific to covering things that you caused   this may be the cause of the confusion as some sources say that it does n't cover anything in the building   that 's generally not true   it usually covers all your liability except for specific exceptions e.g. insurance is often extra

well i was trying to describe it very generally because i think if other people heard the idea especially on an business thread the idea would be taken easily and the idea came to me about a month ago and i guess i did n't explain well but i was wondering what kind of homework i need to research my intention was for people to give me an idea of where to start i 've already started to write out a business plan i just did n't know if there were places to go to find people to invest into it or not and i 'm totally fine with criticism and what not but the way he came out was actually humorous to me to call someone 's idea bad when you do n't know what it is is just silly snapchat seemed like a stupid idea in my opinion why would i only want to see someone 's picture for 10 seconds and it goes away forever but hey that turned into gold so you never know what can be successful and not these days and how are you supposed to find out without taking the risks and going for it so i guess a specific question is if i write a business plan what is my next step who do i show it to

i would hold off on making that threat closing your account first because as others have said it 's not likely to help and second assuming you 're willing to make good on that threat you should only play that card as a final absolute last resort because if it fails and you close your account there is little to nothing else you can try to get what you want first talk one on one with a personal banker at your local ba branch you might be surprised at how helpful they can be next try talking to customer service on the phone after that you might try sending a letter to corporate hq a lot depends on the particular feature you are talking about and why they removed it it could be that 1 the bank finds the feature is just too costly provide for free 2 there may be a technical reason why they can no longer provide it 3 it could be as simple as that few to none of their customers excluding you are actually using the feature or 4 it could be that due to changing regulation or market forces no bank is offering that feature anymore also while they may not care specifically about your business the local branch has an incentive to not drive customers away if it can be reasonably avoided

i guess the answer lies in your tax jurisdiction different countries tax capital gains and income differently and your particular tax situation if the price of the stock goes up or down between when you buy and sell then this counts for tax purposes as a capital gain or loss if you receive a dividend then this counts as income   so for instance if you pay tax on income but not on capital gains or perhaps at a lower rate on capital gains then it would pay you to sell immediately before the stock goes ex dividend and buy back immediately after thereby making a capital gain instead of receiving income

details as usual will depend on local culture and jurisdiction but in most jurisdictions there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something money parcel whatever you received in error usually it 's enough to notify the sender actually it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself what if you send it to the wrong account so you probably have done all you had to and can close your account without further delay however until the time specified by statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed usually a few years the company could ask you to return the money if they do ask be prepared to return it so do not spend it my recommendation would be then lean back and wait

first the good news based on the time involved and the amount of potential profits you will not owe any tax on the sale of the house no matter which option you pick now the details when determining if there are any capital gains the irs cares about the difference between the sale price and the purchase price the amount of the loan the final balance of the loan or the lack of loan do n't factor into the calculation to complicate matters the government does factor into the equation any improvements you have made to the house like a new deck and the cost of buying and selling the house real estate agents if a single person has less than 250 k in capital gains and has used the house as their main residence for 2 of the the previous 5 years their tax is zero for a couple the tax free gain is $ 500k. for your situation since the sale price is less than $ 250 k the capital gains will also be less than $ 250k. you do have one potential area of concern if the house is worth significantly more than $ 150 k the government could claim that the difference between what you charged your parents and what you could have charged was a gift assuming that there are no other factors that you did n't include in the original question it would appear that you will not face any taxes regarding your two options neither will impact the taxes though draining your savings or investments could make it difficult to meet an emergency during the time between the sending of the $ 95 k to the mortgage company and the closing on the deal with your parents if the money came from retirement account it could have an even greater impact on your taxes and retirement situation

i know i 'm late to the party but a couple of as a recent bitcoin advocate i may be out of place in this subreddit as i come from a primarily technological background not a financial one    gt is not a currency it 's a store of value because it is not widely accepted as tender by most people   bitcoin is not a currency yet but because it does not have widespread adoption like other revolutionary technologies there is an inflection bitcoin adoption price where adoption goes from hardly anyone to almost everyone very quickly example   gt;even as a store of value it 's not very good it 's volatile and the fact that there is a limited supply of bitcoin is not a good thing sure in the short run it results in speculation that drives up the price of a coin and makes it all the rage among gamblers but i do n't think anyone can explain how if used on a larger scale would n't lead to deflation in the price of goods   to me this is basic supply and demand and it would in theory become less volatile and more stable following mass adoption bitcoin has virtually no inflation and i agree that this could lead to the deflation of goods but only insofar as that valuation is determined in bitcoin for example milk is still $ 2 but as the value of bitcoin fluctuates i may pay .001 btc or btc for that milk it 's important to remember we 're dealing with a digital asset in an increasingly more world a point of sale device like we use for credit cards could certainly tackle that conversion in the future    gt;also at the end of the day fiat currencies are based on trust and accountability of the government how does bitcoin or any other online currency solve that problem there 's no accountability and it effectively acts as as an anti currency fueled by mistrust in the establishment   this is the best part of bitcoin understanding the incentives if you follow that supply and demand logic then it is in the best interest of everyone who uses bitcoin that the bitcoin software and the system itself be reliable and secure the software is open source so anyone can see how it works and where its flaws and weaknesses are and it is still standing strong after 8 years the biggest weakness so far has been in software updates and changes to the core protocol without any central structure i.e. accountability it can be slow to reach a democratic consensus is such a way that does n't split the blockchain or the network this has led to some of the recent extreme volatility    bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies have tremendous potential to disrupt existing financial institutions the private blockchains by banks are at this point just watch?v = = at some point these institutions will realize that they ca n't create their own facebook they need to find ways to become part of the new facebook market

bob should treat both positions as incomplete and explore a viewpoint which does a better job of separating value from volatility so we should start by recognizing that what bob is really doing is trading pieces of paper say stocks from fund 1 or bonds from fund 2 to pick historically volatile and non volatile instruments for pieces of paper   in the end this is a trade and should always be thought of as such   does bob value his stocks more than his bonds   then he should probably draw from fund 2   if he values his bonds more he should probably draw from fund 1 however both bob and his financial adviser demonstrate an assumption that an instrument whether stock bond or dollar bill has some intrinsic value which may raise over time   the issue is whether its perceived value is a good measure of its actual value or not from this perspective we can see the stock fund 1 as having an actual value that grows quickly 6.5 = and the bond fund 2 as having an actual value that grows slower 4.5 1.15 $ = $   now the perceived value of the stocks is highly volatile   the chairman of the fed and a high velocity trader drives a stock up or down at a rate that would give you this perspective aligns with the broker 's opinion   if the stocks are low it means their perceived value is artificially low and selling it would be a mistake because the market is those pieces of paper as being worth less than they actually are   in this case bob wins by keeping the stocks and selling bonds because the stocks are perceived as undervalued and thus are worth keeping until perceptions change on the other hand consider the assumption we carefully into the argument without any the assumption that the actual value of the stock aligns with its historical value   past performance does not predict future results   its entirely possible that the actual value of the stocks is actually much lower than the historical value and that it was the perceived value that was artificially higher   it may be continuing to do so who knows how overvalued the perceived value actually was   in this case bob wins by keeping the bonds   in this case the stocks may have underperformed to drive perceptions towards their actual value and bob has a great chance to get out from under this market the reality is somewhere between them   the actual values are moving and the perceived values are moving and the world mixes them up enough to make lottery tickets look like a decent investment instrument   so what can we do bob 's broker has a smart idea he 's just not fully explaining it because it is unprofessional to do so   historically speaking bobs who lost a bunch of money in the stock market are poor judges of where the stock market is going next arguably you should be talking to the joes who made a bunch of money they might have more of a clue   humans are emotional beings and we have an emotional instinct to cut ties when things start to go south   the market on emotional thinkers happily giving them what they want in exchange for taking some of their money   bob 's broker is quoting a well recognized phrase that is a polite way of saying you are being emotional in your judgement and here is a phrasing to suggest you should temper that judgement of course the broker may also not know what they 're doing   i 've seen arguments that they do n't   plenty of people listened to their brokers all the way to the great crash of 2008   brokers are human too they just put their emotions in different places   so now bob has no clear voice to listen to   sounds like a trap however there is a solution   bob should think about more than just simple dollars   bob should think about the rest of his life and where he would like the risk to appear   if bob draws from fund 1 liquidating stocks then bob has made a choice to realize any losses or gains early specifically now   he may win he may lose   however no matter what he will have a less volatile portfolio and thus he can rely on it more in the long run if bob draws from fund 2 liquidating bonds instead then bob has made a choice not to realize any losses or gains right away   he may win he may lose   however whether he wins or loses will not be clear perhaps until retirement when he needs to draw on that money and finds fund 1 is still under performing so he has to work a few more years before retirement   there is a magical assumption that the stock market will always continue rewarding risk takers but no one has quite been able to prove it once bob includes his life perspective in the mix and does n't look just at the cold hard dollars on the table bob can make a more educated decision   just to throw more options on the table bob might rationally choose to do any one of a number of other options which are not extremes in order to find a happy medium that best fits bob 's life needs i intentionally chose to label fund 1 as stocks and fund 2 as bonds even though this is a terribly crude assumption because i feel those words have an emotional attachment associated to them which 1 and 2 simply do not   given that part of the argument is that emotions play a part it seemed reasonable to dig into underlying emotional biases as part of my wording   feel free to replace words as you see fit to remove this bias if desired

i think you 're on the wrong track   getting more and more samples from the real world does not make your backtest more accurate it just confirms that your strategy can withstand one particular sample path of a stochastic process the reason why you find it simple to incorporate fees commissions taxes etc is because they 're a static and constant process well they might change over time but most definitely uncorrelated to the markets modelling overnight returns or the top levels of the order book the next day is serious work   first you have to select a suitable model that 's mostly theoretical work but experience can help a lot   then in order to do it data driven you 'd have to through thousands of days of sample data on a set of thousands of instruments to get a feeling aka significant model parameters    data mining i think excel might be the wrong tool for the job   data even just the first 10 levels is a massive   for example the nyse historical data weighs in at a massive 15 tb compressed 74 tb for the last 10 years and costs usd 200k   anyway as for other factors to take into account so how to account for all this in a backtest   personally i would put in some penalty terms as on a return basis for every factor you want to consider do n't them   you can then run a stress test by exploring these parameters i.e. assign some values in the range of 0 to whatever fits   explore them individually only set one penalty term at a time to get a feeling how the strategy might react to stress from that factor   then you can run the backtest with typical or observed combinations of penalty factors and slowly stress them altogether edit just to avoid confusion about terminology   a backtest in the strict sense had i implemented this strategy x years ago what would have happened wo n't benefit from any modelling simply because the real world does the sampling for us however to evaluate a strategy 's you should account for the additional factors and run some stress tests   if the strategy performs well in the real world or no stress scenario but produces losses once a tiny slippage occurs every now and again you could conclude that the strategy is very fragile   the key is to explore the maximum stress the strategy can handle by whatever measure if a lot you can call the strategy robust the latter is what i personally call a backtest the first procedure would go by the name extension towards the past or so some lightweight literature

i think the discrepancy you are seeing is in the detail of what happens once you pay off your student loan   if you take your monthly payment for your student loan and apply that to your mortgage once the student loan is payed off paying the highest interest loan will out ahead    if on the other hand you take your student loan payment and do something else with it not pay down your mortgage you would be better off paying on your mortgage   say you have $ 1000 to put towards either loan and there is 5 years to pay on the student loan and 25 years to pay on the mortgage   by paying on the student loan you are roughly saving 5 years of 5 interest on that $ 1000   by paying on the mortgage you are saving 25 years of 3 interest

first you need to figure out what your objectives for the money are   mostly this boils down to how soon you are going to need the money   if you are as you say very busy and you do n't need the money until retirement i 'd suggest putting your money in a single target date fund such as the blackrock fund   you figure out when you are going to retire and put your money in that fund   the fund will then pick a mix of stocks bonds and other investments adjusting the risk for your time horizon maybe your objectives are different and you want to become an trader   you value being able to say at a bbq oh i bought aapl at $ 20 or i think small caps are over valued   i 'd suggest you take your $ 50,000 and structure it so you invest $ 5,000 a year over 10 years   nothing teaches you about investing like making or losing a bit of money in the market   if you put it all in at once you risk losing it all well before you 've learned many valuable lessons which only the market can teach you i 'd suggest you study the efficient market hypothesis before studying specific markets or strategies

there are several reasons why credit cards are popular in the us on the other hand debit cards do not have any of these going for them   a debit card does n't make much money for the bank unless you overdraw or something so banks do n't have incentive to push you to use them as much   as a result they do n't offer rewards other benefits some people say the ability to spend more than you have is a downside of a credit card   but it 's really an upside   the behavior of doing that when it is n't needed is bad but that 's not the card 's fault it 's the users   you can get a credit card with a very small limit if this is an issue for you the question i find interesting is why debit cards are more popular in your home country   i ca n't think of any advantage they offer besides free cash back   but most people in the us do n't use cash much either   i have to think in your home country the banks have a different revenue model or perhaps your country is n't as eager to offer tons of easy credit to everyone as the us is

thing is it 's already explained in the letter in the end of the first paragraph tesla ’s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units by the end of next year emphasis mine   when i first saw the number i got excited but then i read the actual sentence realized what they meant and it 's still impressive but it 's not 3x increase in production yoy which would be absurd to expect esp when tesla 's trajectory has been just increases per year so far and into the mid term foreseeable future   then they explained it again on the cc elon said something like we 'll exit next year at a 100k rate but it 's hard to tell how steep the curve will be but we 'll probably have over 60k deliveries i think yeah probably   i emailed the author of this article and he still believes that tesla has unequivocally stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015 but that 's simply not correct   i have some people who know press contacts within tesla working on it out though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past   if tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $ 300 today up 30 50%+ instead of the 4 it did go up   but it did n't send it that high because that 's just not what 's happening   i 'm extraordinarily bullish on tesla but 100k in 2015 is just not what 's going to happen   100k+ in 2016 though sounds about right   and is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years including tesla themselves   so yeah this number is n't really news but it 's nice to see them reiterate it

a savings account and a checking account or a demand account or a transactional account have different regulations   for example fractional reserve requirements are 10 against checking accounts but 0 against savings accounts   the theory is that savings accounts are sticky while checking accounts are hot money so the fed wants to stop banks from creating accounts that are regulated as savings accounts but have the features of checking accounts   in the past this was done by banks to pay interest on checking accounts   they eliminated that rule back in the inflation years and instead imposed the rule that to qualify as a savings accounts for regulatory purposes banks must discourage you from using them as transactional accounts   for example by limiting the number of withdrawals per month that can be made from a savings account if the fed gave up on trying to enforce a distinction i suspect there would soon no longer be a distinction

ira contribution must be from your earned income in the sense that you can not contribute to ira more than you have in earned income if all your income is capital gains you can not contribute anything to ira once you 're within the income limit restriction it does n't matter what other money you have because as you said once in your account its all just money but what you 're describing is basically i deposit $ 850 from my salary into an ira and then go pay for my gas with the $ 850 i have from the capital gains so you 're not paying any less taxes here if it makes you feel any better you can describe it to yourself the way you did it does n't really matter

the rent payment is in principle taxable however you should be able to take advantage of the rent a room scheme and the proposed rent falls well under the £ tax threshold for that so no tax will be actually payable and you do n't have to formally declare it as long as you stay below that threshold you should also be fairly well legally protected in case you do split up in future and you want to remove her as you would be living there too she would just be a lodger not a tenant technically an excluded if you did want her to leave you would only need to give reasonable notice and would n't need a formal court order if you needed to force her to go as points out there have been court cases where domestic partners contributing to household expenses while the other partner paid the mortgage have later been able to claim that this implied joint ownership this was on the basis of a constructive trust being implicitly setup by the way they arranged their finances in your case if there 's a clear intention in writing for the money to be treated as rent rather than a contribution towards purchasing the property i think it should make it very hard to claim the contrary later i would also suggest you be clear about whether the rent includes a share of the utility bills and that things like groceries would be handled separately and split 50:50 or whatever as pointed out in a comment there are template agreements for you could use a starting point e.g. this one but it 's likely you 'd need to it to your circumstances another point made in another answer is that there 's potential upcoming legislation to give some rights to partners in the current draft those would kick in after three years or having children if the bill does come into effect you 'd also be able to sign an opt out but only after getting legal advice and it would still be possible though presumably hard to persuade a court to overturn an opt out overall that does create a small risk to you but not one that comes directly from your girlfriend paying rent it 's likely that if you are both on an equal financial footing and had always kept your finances separate that there would n't be any award made anyway and you ca n't run your entire life on hypothetical risks

people just love becoming more well off than they currently are and one of the ways they do it is with leverage leverage requires credit that desire is not exclusive to people who are not already well off for a well off person who wants to become more well off by expanding their real estate ventures paying cash for property is a terrible way to go about it the same goes for other types of business or market investment credit benefits the well off even more greatly than it benefits the poor or the middle class

as pointed out they usually mean libor or the ffr or for other countries the equivalent risk free rate of interest i will just like to add on to what everyone has said here and will like to explain how various interest rates you mentioned work out when the risk free rate moves for let 's denote the risk free rate by rf the savings account interest rate as rs a mortgage interest rate as and a term deposit rate with the bank as savings account interest rate when a central bank the overnight lending rate or the prime rate repo rate etc in some countries banks are not obliged to increase the savings account interest rate usually a downward revision will force them to lower it because they net they will be paying out = rf rs on the other hand if rf goes up and if one of the banks increases the rs then other banks may be forced to do so too under competitive pressure in some countries the central bank has the authority to revise rs without the overnight lending rate term deposits with the bank or certificates of deposit usually movements in these rates are more in sync with rf than rs is the chief difference is that savings account offer more liquidity than term deposits and hence banks can offer lower rates and still get deposits under them the higher interest rate offered by the term deposit as a liquidity risk premium generally interest rates paid by instruments of similar risk profile that offer similar liquidity will move in parallel otherwise there can be arbitrage sometimes these rates can move to anticipate a future change in rf mortgage loan rates or other interests that you pay to the bank if the risk free rate goes up banks will increase these rates to keep the net interest they earn over risk free (= = rf the same if rf drops and if banks are not obliged to decrease loan rates then they will only do so if one of the banks does it first wherever i have said they will do so when one of the banks does it first i am not referring to a but merely to the competitive market theory under such a theory the first one to cut down the profit margin usually has a strong business incentive to do so e.g. gain market share or eliminate competition by lowering profit margins etc others are forced to follow the trend

if your financial needs are n't complex and mostly limited to portfolio management consider looking into the thing called robo advisers proper term is automated investing services   the difference is that robo advisers use software to manage portfolios on a large scale generating big economy of scale and therefore offering a much cheaper services than personal advisor would and unless your financial needs are extremely complex the state of the art of scaled up portfolio management is at the point that a human advisor really does n't give you any value add and as other answers noted human advisor can easily bring in downsides such as conflict of interest and lack of fiduciary responsibility   disclaimer i indirectly derive my living from a company which derives a very small part of their income from a robo adviser therefore there 's a possible small conflict of interest in my answer

gt they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems   interest is likely quoted annually so it 's not 12 for 2 years but 12 for each year invested   gt that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong   extremely unlikely it 's inefficient and furthermore illogical and system breaking under that money just sits around wasting away from inflation as opposed to being invested what is much more likely is immediate or close to immediate investment    admin costs can be accounted for several ways but rest assured are almost certainly drawn out in relatively even payments at a set interval

close warning i may be off a bit here i 'm sure someone will correct me if so traditional 401k or ira money goes in pre tax so yes you avoid paying tax on it now grows untaxed taxes are due when you retire and start taking money back out of the account but your income including these withdrawals is likely to be lower than your peak earning years so your tax rate will be lower you do n't avoid all the tax but you delay it and hopefully reduce it and by doing so there 's more money in your account earning returns roth 401k or ira money goes in after taxes you do pay income tax now however all returns on the money are untaxed i believe and you pay no tax when you 're eligible to withdraw the funds   either or both kinds of 401k may be eligible for some percentage of matching funds from your employer there are some incentives for them to offer this benefit i believe that even if you 're doing a roth 401k the matching funds legally have to go in as traditional plan and yes as that implies it is possible to split your contribution between the two styles note the matching funds are free money if your plan offers a match it is highly recommended that you contribute enough to your 401k to capture the maximum match

aiui this is not terribly abnormal there are sometimes to as pending charges or holds and actual charges an authorisation reserves money but does n't actually take it normally what happens when you pay by card is that the merchant gets an authorisation immediately then some time later the authorisation is converted into an actual charge when the merchant takes the money sometimes merchants are slow in taking the actual charge either deliberately some merchants wo n't charge your card until they actually supply the goods to reduce the chance of having to process a refund or because of administrative somewhere when this happens the authorisation can time out before the actual charge is taken so you get the pattern you see first the authorisation appears then it times out and and finally the actual charge shows up

that price is the post tender price which already reflects arbitrage   it 's less than $ 65 on the market because that 's the highest offer out there and the market price reflects the risk that the $ 65 will not be paid   it also reflects the time value of money until the cash is disbursed including blows to liquidity in other words you are buying the stock burdened with the risk that it might rapidly deflate if the deal falls through or gets at a lower price or that your money might be better spent somewhere other than waiting for the i bank to release the tender offer amount to you two months ago traded around $ 55 and four months ago it traded around $ 50   if the deal fails then you could be stuck either taking a big loss to get out of the stock or waiting months or longer in the hope that another deal will come along and pay $ 65 which may leave you with npv loss from today   the market seems to think that risk is pretty small but it 's still there if the payout is $ 65 then you get a discount for time value and a discount for failed merger risk   that means the price is less than $ 65   you can still make money on it if the merger goes through   some investors believe they have a better way to make money and no doubt the tender offer of the merger of two publicly traded companies is already heavily arbitraged   but that said it may still pay off tender offer arbitrage is discussed in this article

without providing direct investment advice i can tell you that bond most assuredly are not recession proof   all investments have risk and each recession will impact asset classes slightly differently before getting started bonds are loans   you are loaning money   do n't ever think of them as anything but that bonds loans have two chief risks default risk and inflation risk    default risk is the most obvious risk this is when the person to whom you are loaning does not pay back   in a recession this can easily happen if the debtor is a company and the company goes bankrupt in the environment inflation risk is a more subtle risk and occurs when the fixed interest rate on your loan yields less than the inflation rate   this causes the real value of your investment to depreciate over time    the second risk is most pronounced when the bonds that you own are government bonds and the recession causes the government to be unable to pay back its debts   in these circumstances the government may print more money to pay back its creditors generating inflation

i think the key thing is flexibility the money is not tied in with the offset mortgage if you find a better investment you can always take some of it out and put it towards that instead once it matures if there is nothing good to reinvest in then it can go back into the offset mortgage once you have had money in the offset account even if you take it out you have already saved money on your mortgage right now you would be pressed to find an instant access isa with a rate higher than 1.5 so if you need immediate access then the offset account seems good on the other hand for retirement you might be saving longer term and then you can get an isa rate of 3 currently which may be better for a part of the money or perhaps the upcoming lifetime isa with 25 yearly bonus may make sense for part of the money if you do not need easy access to all of it as dilip says this assumes you want safe investments

in general there are two types of futures contract a put and call   both contract types have both common sides of a transaction a buyer and a seller   you can sell a put contract or sell a call contract also you 're just taking the other side of the agreement   if you 're selling it would commonly be called a sell to open meaning you 're opening your position by selling a contract which is different from simply selling an option that you currently own to close your position a put contract gives the buyer the right to sell shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to put the shares on someone else    a call contract gives the buyer the right to buy shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to call on someone for shares american options contracts allow the buyer can exercise their rights under the contract on or before the expiration date while european type contracts can only be exercised on the expiration date to address your example   typically for stock an option contract involves 100 shares of a stock   the value of these contracts fluctuates the same way other assets do   typically retail investors do n't actually exercise their contracts they just close a profitable position before the exercise deadline and let unprofitable positions expire worthless   if you were to buy a single call contract with an exercise price of $ 100 with a maturity date of august 1 for $ 1 per share the contract will have cost you $ 100   let 's say on august 1 the underlying shares are now available for $ 110 per share   you have two options option 1 on august 1 you can exercise your contract to buy 100 shares for $ 100 per share   you would exercise for $ 10,000 $ 100 times 100 shares then sell the shares for $ 10 profit per share less the cost of the contract and transaction costs option 2 your contract is now worth something closer to $ 10 per share up from $ 1 per share when you bought it   you can just sell your contract without ever exercising it to someone with an account large enough to exercise and/or an actual desire to receive the asset or commodity

to quote the answer you linked to perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement so if your business purchased the $ 1000 gift card for $ 800 you should see a $ 800 charge appearing on a business cc or bank statement you would therefore be able to deduct the $ 800 but not the full $ 1000 of items that you purchase with it side notes

in the us expense ratios are stated in the prospectus of the fund which you must acknowledge as having read before the fund will accept your money to invest you never acknowledged any such thing actually you did when you checked the box saying that you accept the terms of the agreement when you made the investment the expense ratio can be changed by vote of the board of directors of the fund but the change must be included in the revised prospectus of the fund and current investors must be informed of the change this can be a direct mailing or e mailing from the mutual fund or an invitation to read the new prospectus on the fund 's website for those who have elected to go paperless   so yes the expense ratio can be changed though not by the manager of the fund e.g. just because he she wants a bigger salary or a fancier company car as you think and not without notice to investors

no you capitalize all that and deduct as depreciation from the royalties what it means is that you can not deduct the expense when it is incurred but only when you started receiving income that the expense was used to derive this is similar to capitalizing building improvements which can only be deducted when you start getting rent or capitalizing software development expenses which can only be deducted once you start selling licensing the developed software in the case of book writing you capitalize the expenses and deduct them once you start receiving royalties the period over which you deduct the depreciation schedule depends on the type of the expense and the type of the income so you better get a guidance from a licensed tax accountant ea or cpa licensed in your state

the answer to your question depends on your answer to this question   would you be willing to take out a loan at that interest rate and invest that money straight into stocks that 's basically what you 're planning to do you leverage your stock investment which is a valid and often used way to improve returns better returns always come with more risk depending on your location there might be a tax advantage to a mortage which you can take into account

i would undoubtedly sell the investments if they are positive maybe even a little negative   that 's what non retirement investments are for building wealth to spend give etc flipping things may put it in perspective   would you borrow money or liquidate your emergency fund in order to invest in mutual funds if you can completely ignore risk then this may make sense let 's say if you could borrow money at 3.75 and had a guaranteed investment return of 7.5 and a guaranteed source of income job but mutual funds stocks bonds are n't even guaranteed to make money and they most definitely can lose and lose big also i hope your job is n't in any way tied to the oil industry on the other hand if you take a loan and fall on hard times you can liquidate your mutual funds to get out of the bind but you are at the mercy of the market and the worth of your investments at that point   so it may come down to whether you want to choose when to spend your investments when they are up or at some future date when they may be worth much less or much more

our problem is not that a few interest groups have favor our problem is that dividing the population by interest groups the governments focus in too many directions catering to many minute interests often away from the common good see hyper     this is good politics we do n't want a government that only extends the protection of the law to majority groups but this is also the exact reason why government can never be trusted with the distribution of goods and services when you cater to that one asshole that has to have it his way everyone else suffers why the fuck would you want that in charge of any part of the economy

imagine the following scenario you have a credit limit of $ 1000 and you want to by a tablet from a store it costs $ 600 you then walk next door and buy a tv for $ 600 you would expect that you would go over your limit and the second transaction will be rejected as long as that hold is in place you do n't have access to those blocked funds that makes sure that you ca n't promise to pay more than you have funds on the card holds can get in the way if you are close to your credit limit people run into this problem if they reserve a hotel room rent a car or purchase gasoline the hold is set at a specific level to make sure you have enough funds for the typical transaction this distance between vendors is not relevant the bank is blocking funds based on a request from a vendor they have to block the funds because you might use the multiple times in the same store it is possible that the card company might release the hold based on the request by the vendor but they generally do n't   if this is a debit card linked to a bank account the bank can have access to the overdraft system or a linked savings account if is is a credit card they can decide to to increase your credit limit and offer you what is essentially a loan plus they can hit you with fees but if the card is a prepaid debit card or gift card they do n't want to allow you to go beyond your limit   if this is a card that you plan on recharging you could put extra funds on the card to allow both the old hold and the new hold to co exist

for those who are looking to improve credit for the sake of being able to obtain future credit on better terms i think a rewards credit card is the best way to do that i recommend that you only use as many cards as you need to gain the best rewards i have one card that gives 6 back on grocery purchases and i have another card that gives 4 back on petrol and 2 back on dining out both of those cards give only 1 back on all other purchases so i use a third card that gives 1.5 back across the board for my other purchases i pay all of the cards in full each month if there was a card that did n't give me an advantage in making my purchases i would n't own it i 'm generally frugal so i know that there is no psychological disadvantage to paying with a card you have to consider your own spending discipline when deciding whether paying with cards is an advantage for you in the end you should only use debt when you can pay low interest rates or as in the case of the cards above no interest at all in the case of the low interest debt it should be allowing you to make an investment that will pay you more by having it sooner than the cost of interest you might need a car to get to work but you probably do n't need a new car borrow as little as you can and repay your loans as quickly as you can debt can be a tool for your advantage but only if used wisely do n't be in by the temptation of something new and shiny now that you can pay for later

netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows e.g. debits credits payments receipts income expense by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows creating one transaction    for example if you make two trades in one day with your broker one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 the transactions are netted meaning they will send you the net amount of $ 10 $ 110 inflow $ 100 outflow in a more general sense netting of instructions it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the net effect e.g. one step forward two steps back would combine to a net one step back   most likely it will apply to the exchange of money but it could be applied more broadly note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows you can also net multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows

let me start with a somewhat sarcastic statement there are probably as many things done to analyze a stock as there are people doing the analysis that said at a general level an analyst researches the historical performance of the company at a fairly detailed level operations within divisions of the company product development cycles within divisions expenses vs income trends for each division and product marketing costs customer acquisition costs etc gathers information about what the company is doing now and planning to do in the future often by a discussion with principles at the company establishes a view on related macro economic trends sector and industry trends demographic trends etc and combines it all to forecast a change in revenues margins free cash flow dividends etc over a period of time    they then apply statistics that relate those numbers to stock price in order to imply stock prices and price ranges over those same periods   finally depending on how those stock prices compare to the current stock price they 'll classify the stock as buy sell hold etc this sounds like alot of work    and it generally is if you get detailed about it which is what professionals or significant money managers are doing    however there are also lots of arm chair analysts posting their output on any number of financial sites seeking alpha motley fool etc if you 'd like to really explore the range of detail some people consider as a stock analysis   that sounds more negative than i intended it to be so let me clarify that i think some of these write ups are really quite good imo

its not just citi and bofa even barclays hsbc and other large banks are trading below book value in markets they are listed are there particular assets that are causing these two banks to be valued lower relative to their book values than the other banks there no particular assets given the current economic situation most banks are not making good returns i.e. expected returns of markets are around 10 12 and the returns getting generated are around 4 6 the overall slow down in various segments as well as regulations in most countries mean that banks have to at the business model in short term and generate more revenue the market believes that banks may loose money faster and hence the negative outlook and the trading below the book value note book value is derived in ideal conditions i.e. when the company is healthy if any company were to sell the assets in distress the actual funds raised would be quite a bit less than book value its also to be noted that typically banks would not close out and hence book value to an extent is just an indicator or is it a residual based on their being the biggest losers of 2008 that are still around today the 2008 has gone past this is more recent if you look most of these banks were doing quite well till last year and had recovered substantially after 2008

what prevents a company from doing secondary public stock offerings on regular basis the primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds that can be utilized for funding the business if no funding is needed i.e. company has sufficient funds or no expansion plans this funding creates a drag and existing shareholder including promoters loose value for example with the current 100 invested the company is able to generate say 125 25 as profit if additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering then with 200 the company should mark around 250 else it looses value so if the company took additional 100 and did not is not able to deploy in market on 200 they still make 25 as profit its bad there are other reasons i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc thus the reasons for company to do a secondary po are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders

companies are expected to make a profit otherwise there is no point to their existence and no motivation for investment that profit comes back to shareholders as growth and/or dividend if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to turn back into investment to facilitate increased future earnings it increases shareholder equity and share price if a company is doing well and has a healthy profit to pay out in dividend it makes the shares more attractive to investors which pushes the price up either way shares go up share prices drop when companies lose money or there are market affecting all companies recessions or when individual companies fail averaged over all companies over the long term decades stocks can be reasonably expected to go up

as @dilip suggested in the comments the problem is the accountability of the reimbursement plans in order for the reimbursement to be non taxable there has to be a reimbursement plan and policy set up by the employer it has to be done per receipt and accounted for correctly if the employer just cuts you a check the conditions may not be met and as such the reimbursement becomes taxable in your case it seems like the employer has not set up a proper accountable reimbursement plan thus your reimbursements are taxable pointed out that since the employer also does n't withhold taxes as he should you may have an unexpected tax bill on april 15 this article describes the distinction between the accountable and non accountable plans only with the accountable plans the reimbursements are non taxable

a mutual fund 's return or yield has nothing to do with what you receive from the mutual fund the annual percentage return is simply the percentage increase or decrease of the value of one share of the mutual fund from january 1 till december 31 the cash value of any distributions dividend income short term capital gains   long term capital gains might be reported separately or might be included in the annual return   what you receive from the mutual fund is the distributions which you have the option of taking in cash and spending on whatever you like or investing elsewhere or of re investing into the fund without ever actually touching the money regardless of whether you take a distribution as cash or re invest it in the mutual fund that amount is taxable income in most jurisdictions in the us long term capital gains are taxed at different lower rates than ordinary income and i believe that long term capital gains from mutual funds are not taxed at all in india you are not taxed on the increase in the value of your investment caused by an increase in the share price over the year nor do you get deduct the loss if the share price declined over the year it is only when you sell the mutual fund shares back to the mutual fund company that you have to pay taxes on the capital gains if you sold for a higher price or deduct the capital loss if you sold for a lower price than the purchase price of the shares be aware that different shares in the sale might have different purchase prices because they were bought at different times and thus have different gains and losses   so how do you calculate your personal return from the mutual fund investment if you have a money management program or a spreadsheet program it can calculate your return for you if you have online access to your mutual fund account on its website it will most likely have a tool called something like personal rate of return and this will provide you with the same calculations without your having to type in all the data by hand finally if you want to do it personally by hand i am sure that someone will soon post an answer writing out the gory details

i wrote a spreadsheet < < it may not be obvious this is a link to pull down the spreadsheet a while back that might help you you can start by putting your current salary next to your age adjust the percent of income saved 14 for you and put in the current total   the sheet basically shows that if one saves 15 from day one of working and averages an 8 return they are on track to save over 20x their final income and at the 4 withdrawal rate will replace 80 of their income remember if they save 15 and at retirement the 7.65 fica goes away so it 's 100 of what they had anyway for what it 's worth a 10 average return drops what you need to save down to 9 i say to a young person try to start at 15 better that when you 're 40 you realize you 're well ahead of schedule and can relax a bit than to assume that 8 9 is enough to save and find you need a large increase to catch up   to answer specifically here there are those who concluded that 4 is a safe withdrawal rate so by targeting 20x your final income as retirement savings you 'll be able to retire well   retirement spending needs are not the same for everyone when i cite an 80 replacement rate it 's a guess a rule of thumb that many point out is flawed the real number is your true spending need which of course can be far higher or lower the younger investor is going to have a far tougher time guessing this number than someone a decade away from retiring the 80 is just a target to get started it should shift to the real number in your 40s or 50s as that number becomes clear   next i see my original answer did n't address social security benefits the benefit is n't linear a lower wage earner can see a benefit of as much as 50 of what they earned each year while a very high earner would see far less as the benefit has a maximum a $ 90k earner will see 30 or less the social security site does a great job of giving you your projected benefit and you can adjust target savings accordingly   2016 update the prior 20 years returned cagr considering there were 2 crashes one of which was called a mini depression is pretty remarkable for what it 's worth my adult investing life started in 1984 and i 've seen a cagr of for forecasting purposes i think 8 long term is a conservative number   to answer member comment the 10 years from 2006 2015 had a cagr of time has a way of averaging that lost decade the 00 's to a more reasonable number

i 'll use similar logic to dave ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we 're talking about paying off any debt early   also consider this tweet and what it means for student loans to you they 're debt to the government they 're assets if you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost would you borrow money at interest rate to obtain a degree   put it in the housing way if you paid off your home would you pull out an equity loan line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings   i ca n't answer the question for you or anyone else as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either i can tell you two observations i 've made about this question it comes a lot with housing over time   first it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0 interest rate credit cards to buy stocks or float bills for a while   how quickly people forget what it feels and looks like when you see your financial assets drop 50 60   it 's not wall street that 's greedy it 's most average investors   second people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action as carnegie said concentration is the key to wealth and concentrating your financial energy on something instead of throwing it all over the place can simplify your life   this is one reason why lottery winners do n't keep their winnings their financial behavior was rotten before winning and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior   even if you get paid a lot or little that 's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else like money happiness peace of mind etc follows

i was involved with them a couple years back it seemed like a utopia but i could n't seem to get it off the ground i just recently found some disturbing info on the top tier of leaders that let me breath a sigh of relief that i am no longer involved although i would n't straight up tell you no i would ask that you really use some due diligence and make a very informed decision look up in google and browse there quite a few people that were successful had and do n't have very good things to say so it 's not shallow criticism they 're out quite a few of them were high enough up the ladder that i had even seen them do open meetings and seminars

gt that there are more jobs today is n't a convincing argument   you yourself said that automation means there is a net loss in jobs   if that were true there would be less jobs now than in 1900   but the opposite is true   products are more efficiently reaching the consumer   this means more people are buying more things   this means producers have to hire more people or buy more raw materials   lets go with a real classic example   lets say that you and myself make sewing needles   we both do it by hand because in this example we are at the dawn of the industrial revolution making a needle at a time   now lets say i figure out a way to make a machine that makes 100 needles in the time it took me to make 1 and because less of my time is going into each needle i can sell them cheaper   i am now able to reach more stores than before to sell my sewing needles   i have to hire some more people to make deliveries because i can only do so much by myself   now i also grow to the point of having to buy another machine because my business is booming   people love my sewing needles   but i ca n't man 2 machines so i hire in another person   now i have more people making deliveries and i no longer deliver myself because i am better at making needles than delivering them   the guys supplying me with the metal to make the needles also had to hire some people to keep up with my demand   and the people mining the metal for my needles also had to hire another miner   this may sound like a made up story but this sort of thing was going on at this time     the argument that automation kills jobs has been around since before the industrial revolution   how much would your cell phone be if we were still using horse and cart to deliver goods   would your mother sister girlfriend wife yourself if you are a girl be able to have a full time job if they did not have a washing machine iron vacuum cleaner other appliances   what kind of selection in the grocery store would you have if the tractor was never used

note this is a complicated topic i 've read the rules multiple times and i 'm still not sure i understand them perfectly so please take this with a pinch of salt and read the rules for yourself the at which a test is done against the lta are known as a benefit event bce there are 13 of these they 're numbered 1 9 with the addition of some extras numbered d. however the most important ones for those with defined contribution pensions are broadly the idea is that a bce occurs when you start taking money out of your pension and when you reach age 75 each time one happens the amount you are taking out gets compared against the lta and a certain percentage of your lta gets designated as being used does n't necessarily mean you actually receive the money immediately just that some of your money is switched into a mode where you can start receiving it in different ways the rules are designed to avoid double counting so broadly anything that was taken off your lta wo n't be taken off a second time the cumulative use of your lta is tracked as a percentage rather than an absolute amount to take account of any changes in the lta between the different times you crystallise money for example if you crystallise £ 100 k when the lta is £ 1mn that 's 10 of your lta gone if later on the lta has risen to £ and you take out £ 110 k that 's another 10 once you hit 100 you start paying a lta charge on any excess the really simple path here is if you just get an annuity with your entire pot before hitting age 75 and you do n't make any further pension contributions after then only bce 4 applies your pension pot all of which is being used to buy the annuity is compared with the lta after this point your entire pension pot is considered to be so no more will apply the tests at age 75 only apply if you still have money that you have n't taken out or used to buy an annuity the annuity payments themselves will be subject to income tax at your normal rate at the time you receive them i.e. 0 20 40 or 45 depending on how much other income you have in reality most people would want to take 25 of their pot as a lump sum at the same time as buying an annuity given that it 's tax free if you 're under the lta at this point bce 6 applies in addition to bce 4 but again the overall effect of the test is pretty simple look at the total pension pot lump sum + cost of annuity and if it 's under the lta you 're fine again at this point no more will apply as all the money is considered to have been fully distributed if you only use part of the money for an annuity lump sum then only that part of the money is compared against the lta and the rest stays in your pension and will be compared later the 25 limit for a tax free lump sum applies to the total you are taking out at that point if you have £ 200 k and are taking out £ 100 k you can take out £ 25 k as a tax free lump sum and use £ 75 k for the annuity the other £ 100 k stays in your pension many people see annuity rates as very low and will want to take on more risk and reward by using drawdown for at least part of their pension essentially you can designate part of your pension for drawdown and at that point bce 1 applies to the money you designate once designated you can start drawing the money out as income which will be taxed at your normal income tax rate at the time you receive it again you can take 25 as a lump sum at this point which will be subject to bce 6 there 's also an alternative route where you put everything into access drawdown without taking any lump sum immediately and then as you actually withdraw income 25 is tax free and the rest is taxed as income the overall effect is the same but it gives you more control over when you get the tax free bit however because with drawdown you can actually leave the money in your pension and growing tax free there 's a further test against the lta at age 75 under bce to avoid double counting prevention of overlap the amount left in the drawdown fund at that point is reduced by whatever was previously tested against bce 1 so if you put £ 150 k into drawdown initially and it 's grown to £ 200 k by age 75 then another £ 50 k will crystallise under bce i think that if you put £ 150 k into drawdown initially and it grows by £ 50 k but you take that out as income so that only £ 150 k or less remains at age 75 then the amount under bce is nil also when money is in drawdown you can choose to use it to buy an annuity bce 4 is applied at this point if before age 75 but as with bce this is reduced by anything that was previously under bce 1 if you only use some of it to buy an annuity the reduction is pro e.g. if you started out with £ 150 k moved into drawdown and later it has grown to £ 200 k and you use £ 100 k to buy an annuity then the reduction is £ 75 k so £ 25 k is considered to have under bce 4 once you reach age 75 as well as any money that 's still in drawdown anything you have n't yet at all gets tested against the lta under bce broadly once you go over the lta the charges are simple there 's never any explanation given for these two rates but i think it 's all based on trying to at least cancel out the benefit you got from using your pension on the assumption that so with the 25 charge + 20 income tax if you take out £ 100 you 'll end up with £ 75 gross income so £ 60 net income just the same as if you 'd originally paid 40 tax this ignores the effect of investment growth but if you would have saved the £ 60 in an isa the end result is the same if you had growth of say 50 over the time the money was in your pension it 'll be the same effect if you had £ 100 growing to £ 150 and now received 60 of it or if you had £ 60 growing to £ 90 untaxed in an isa the 55 lump sum charge is in case you are paying 40 tax when you take it out to make sure that it 's not a more attractive option than the tax if you have £ 100 either you get £ 45 tax free via a lump sum or you get £ 75 gross and hence £ 45 net i have n't covered lots of cases here defined benefit pensions roughly when you start receiving the pension 20x the initial income from the pension is deemed to crystallise under bce 2 and any lump sum you receive under bce 6 in the former case you could end up having to pay the lta charge with money you have n't actually got yet and you can ask the pension administrator to instead reduce your pension to pay it however there are lots of special cases for defined benefit pensions mostly for historical reasons so you should make sure you check with your pension administrator about this if you die before age 75 at which point the lta test is applied via either bce or bce 7 after paying the lta charge if any your dependents or whoever else you leave it to gets the remainder tax free transferring overseas bce 8) scheme pensions under bce 2 and bce 3 i think these are relatively uncommon some corner cases covered by regulations bce 9

have n't read this but will thanks   i would agree with you that there are certain aspects and forms of private equity that could be considered reprehensible first carried interest probably is n't the fairest thing in the world but that 's not going to last much longer i think you could also argue that some hostile takeovers approach the reprehensible an example off the top of my head would be carl icahn and i would argue on the whole however that most hostile takeovers are accretive in the sense that you 're taking out management that is either being tremendously negligent or destroying value all together    in both of those instances you can make succinct and well thought out arguments but this is n't what 's happening with bain on the whole i would disagree and argue that pe backed restructurings are accretive to the economy as a whole

one of the best things you can do for this purpose while getting a modest roi on a passive investment is invest in a company that profitably does whatever you want to see more of for example you could invest in a for profit company that sells needed goods to low income people at lower prices   something like wal mart which is one of the most effective anti poverty engines in the us   you might also say the same of something like aldi owner of aldi stores and trader joe 's which is a discount store chain   this is true even though a company like wal mart is seeking to make money first   its customer base tends to skew heavily towards low income consumers and historically to rural and elderly consumers   when wal mart is able to provide food clothing appliances and the like to poor people at a lower cost it is making it marginally less painful to have a low income peter can explain why wal mart is a humanitarian enterprise walmart ’s customer base is heavily concentrated in the bottom income quintile which spends heavily on food the bottom income quintile spends about 25 percent of income on food compared to just 3.5 percent for the top quintile so the benefits of walmart ’s substantially lower prices to the lowest earning cohort are huge especially on food as points out this view of wal mart dramatically lowering prices that low income people pay for food was by an obama adviser that 's just one company   you can pick the industry and company that best suits your personal preferences alternatively you could invest in something like whole foods a company with multiple missions to improve the planet and the community in addition to the more typical mission of being a prosperous retail chain of course as a general proposition a less than entirely altruistic charity inclined investment does n't need to be targeted at those with low incomes or at saving the planet   you could invest in almost anything you think is good yachts yo energy production industrial inputs music performances and the company will take care of making more of that good thing   you did n't say whether your goal was to help the poor the planet arts sciences knowledge community or whatever what i understand you to be saying is you are willing to accept a lower roi in exchange for some warm from your investment   that seems perfectly valid and reasonable to me but it makes it much more subjective and particular to your tastes   so you 'll need to pick something that 's meaningful to you   if you 're going to trade roi for positive feelings then you should pick whatever gives you your optimal blend of emotions and returns alternatively you could invest in something stable and predictable to beat inflation some sort of index or fund and then annually use some portion of those profits to simply give to the charity of your choice   your investment and your charity do not necessarily need to be the same vehicle

the response to this question will be different depending which of the investment you are using   value investors look at the situation the company is in and try to determine what the company is worth and what it will be worth in the future then they look at the current stock price and decide whether or not the stock is priced at a good deal or not if the stock price is priced lower than they believe the company is worth they would want to buy stock and if the price rises above what they believe to be the true value they would sell these types of investors are not looking at the history or trend of what the price has done in the past only what the current price is and where they believe the price should be in the future   technical analysis investors do something different it is their belief that as stock prices go up and down they generally follow patterns by looking at a chart of what a stock price has been in the past they try to predict where it is headed and buy or sell based on that prediction   in general value investors are longer term investors and technical analysis investors are short term investors   the advice you are considering makes a lot of sense if you are using technical analysis if you have a stock that is trending down your strategy probably tells you to sell buying more in the hopes of turning things around would be seen as a mistake it is like the gambler in vegas who keeps playing a game he is losing hoping that his luck changes   however for the value investor the historical price of a stock and even the amount you currently have gained or lost in the stock are essentially ignored all that matters is whether or not the stock price is above or below the true value determined by the investor for him if the stock price falls and he believes the company still has a high value it could be a signal to buy more the above advice does n't really apply for them   many investors do n't follow either of these strategies they believe that it is too difficult and risky to try to predict the future price of an individual stock instead they invest in many companies all at once using index mutual funds believing that the stock market as a whole always heads up over a long time frame those investors do n't care at all if the prices of stock are going up or down they simply keep investing each month and hold until they have another use for the money the above advice is n't useful for them at all   no matter which kind of investing you are doing the most important thing is to pick a strategy you believe in and follow the plan without emotion emotions can cause investors to make mistakes and start buying when their strategy tells them to sell   instead of trying to follow fortune cookie advice like do n't throw good money after bad choose an investment strategy make a plan test it and follow it cautiously after all it may be a bad plan for what it is worth i am the third type of investor listed above i do n't buy individual stocks and i do n't look at the stock prices when investing more each month your description of your own strategy as buy and hold suggests you might prefer the same approach

various types of corporate actions will a price adjustment   in the case of dividends the cash that will be paid out as a dividend to share holders forms part of a company 's equity   once the company pays a dividend that cash is no longer part of the company 's equity and the share price is adjusted accordingly for example if apple is trading at $ 101 per share at the close of business on the day prior to going ex dividend and a dividend of $ 1 per share has been declared then the closing price will be adjusted by $ 1 to give a closing quote of $ 100 although the dividend is not paid out until the dividend pay date the share price is adjusted at the close of business on the day prior to the ex dividend date since any new purchases on or after the ex dividend date are not entitled to receive the dividend distribution so in effect new purchases are buying on the basis of a reduced equity    it will be the exchange providing the quote that performs the price adjustment not google or yahoo   the exchange will perform the adjustment at the close prior to each ex dividend date so when you are looking at historical data you are looking at price data that includes each adjustment

gt you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work   i do n't have to prove anything when i 'm

claims   gt all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do

monopoly quasi state   you have no evidence to support this why are you reverting to this nonsense   gt   it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice   no it does not this is a straw man a voluntary society does n't preclude the possibility of people buying bad food or something like that it does n't even preclude the possibility of third party assurances to prevent bad food it just does n't have a built in monopoly on assurance services that you have to use in order to buy sell   gt so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then   no people buy and sell freely all of the time ever bought something from craigslist ebay silk road i 'd say those are pretty much free markets   gt you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right   you 're conveniently leaving out how kids worked people all day and still starved to death as the alternative up until industrialization allowed a better quality of life it 's not like they could have just passed a fucking law and mandated a 40 hour week and instantly had prosperity it was because they did grind their way through the industrial revolution that we 're able to live lives of leisure and prosperity if you think that government action can get people out of poverty by decree then tell it to the third world countries that are still developing i 'm sure they 'd be all ears   gt because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do   that they do it does n't mean that it could n't happen without the state on a voluntary basis the funding for all of these programs combined is easily less than what a quarter of the government 's budget if the people who made this same objection put their money where their mouth is there would be no shortage of funding people from the left and the right alike claim that they want these things so which is it are you telling me that there are just millions and millions of people who virtue signal about humanitarian efforts   gt this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum   actually i do n't think that immediately destroying governments will create the best outcomes as that usually happens violently and results in someone wanting to fill the roles performed by government instead i think that based upon history individuals are less likely to be violent when they are n't acting on behalf of governments and they can and will find alternatives to the state that will replace it over time if they are not violently stopped here are some examples   1 i would rather be entirely left alone by the state police agents and allowed to use my own private security i would not be taxed for state agents and would instead pay out of pocket this would likely lower the cost since they would be interested in preventing losses rather than busting people for parking tickets speeding tickets drug offenses civil asset forfeiture etc would you not agree that this is a superior model 2 i would rather have private large scale defense since it would not be involved in international wars of aggression i would not be taxed and would instead pay out of pocket all else equal this would be less expensive and less dangerous since resources would only be used for defense would you not agree that this is a superior model 3 i would rather have a private system of healthcare rather than a government one being free to not pay into medicare medicaid this along with eliminating certificates of need monopolization by the ama eliminating ip protections and the like would lower the cost more than nationalization would and would also allow providers to better align with my preferences would you not agree that this is a superior system   gt yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man   actually the purported left wing anarchists in spain did carry out what is called the red terror i put that in quotes because i do not agree with their methods or their ideology change must be done through the market not through violence   gt why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo   because appeals to tradition are not rational arguments and anarchists are not advocating for positive action against you statists are arguing that others be subject to their government if a person is trying to argue against his own he would n't have the burden of proof simply because he had been enslaved for some time   gt you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up   on the contrary i do have something to back it up the market responds better to consumer preferences on an individual level than governments do if you disagree with me on healthcare and want a collective system the market can put you with other like minded individuals and me with those who share my views a state can not   gt why do we have states right now   you 're conflating violence and efficiency that 's like saying if kids have such great ideas why are they still living under their parent 's rule it 's not because the ideas are bad it 's because the parents are keeping them there states do n't compete they rule with violence the notion of creating a market for violence to stop rule by violence is contradictory

we 're going through this at my company right now   the billing accounts receivable office near us has largely been automated and they are trying to find positions for all of the displaced employees   there are a few open positions in my office and if these employees can pass a skills test interview they will get to take one of our spots and stay with the company   if they are unable to pass the skills test excel and basic accounting concepts they will be laid off   some of these people have worked for our company for over 20 years but since they did n't bother to upgrade their skill sets over the years many of them will be out of work   my coworkers think i 'm crazy for continuing to obtain certifications and take classes but i 'm thinking towards the future

the globe and mail has an interesting article on what you can do with your rrsps be aware that the article is from early 2011 and rules change they describe holding your own mortgage inside your rrsp that is if you have $ 100,000 inside your rrsp already and your remaining mortgage is $ 100,000 you can use that money to pay off your mortgage then pay back the money at interest generating a tax deferred profit inside your rrsp that approach may be viable though you 'd want to talk to your accountant first i 'd be very cautious about loaning money to someone else for a second mortgage using my rrsp though second mortgages are inherently risky so this is a very speculative investment once you make an rrsp contribution that space is used up barring a couple of exceptions such as the life long learning plan so let 's say you used $ 100,000 of your rrsp to loan to someone for a second mortgage any interest payments should be sheltered inside the rrsp substantial benefit but if the person defaults on the second mortgage which you should expect to be a significant possibility you 've lost your entire $ 100,000 contribution room as well as obviously the $ 100,000 that you loaned out i ca n't tell you whether or not it makes sense to invest in risky second mortgage loans and i ca n't tell you whether if you choose to do so it definitely should be done inside an rrsp there are substantial risks in the loan and there are both costs and benefits to doing so inside an rrsp hopefully though i 've helped you understand the questions you should be asking yourself

i do n't believe it makes a difference at the federal level if you file taxes jointly gains losses and dividends appear on the joint tax account   if you file separately i assume the tax implications only appear on the owner 's tax return   then the benefits might outweigh the costs but only if you correctly predict market behavior and the behavior of your positions for example lets say you lose 30k in the market in one year and your spouse makes 30k   if you 're filing jointly the loss out the gain and you have no net taxes on the investment   if you 're filing separately you can claim 3k in loss the remaining in loss is banked to future tax years but your spouse pays taxes on 30k in gain where things get more interesting is at the state level   i live in a community property state where it does n't matter whether you have separate accounts or not   if i use community money to purchase a stock and make a million bucks that million bucks is shared by the two of us whether the account is in my name our in our name   income during the marriage is considered community property   however property you bring into the marriage is not   and inheritances are not community property until co not sure how it works in other states   i grew up in what 's called an equitable property state

being self employed your profit is calculated as all the bills you send out minus all business related cost that you have you will need a receipt for everything and there are different rules for things that last for long time long tools machinery   you can file your taxes yourself the hrs website will tell you how to and you can do it online it 's close to the same as your normal online tax return only thing is that you must keep receipts for all the cost that you claim   your tax assuming your gross salary is £ 25,000 and your profits are about £ 10,000 you will be paying 8 for national insurance and 20 income tax if you go above £ or thereabouts you pay 40 income tax on any income above that threshold instead of 20 but your national insurance payments stop

if i open and fill an isa then leave the account alone for an entire year will i then be able to add an additional £ insert isa limit here to the original money i put in the account   yes you can will the full sum of £ last years limit + £ this years limit that is in the account have interest paid on it yes it will will the account be closed at the end of the period regardless no the account would only be closed if you requested it to be closed otherwise it would sit there with the original balance in it earning interest at the stated rate the only way i can see an isa being of any worth is by building up a substantial amount this way but you would need so much cash laying around to max the isa year on year just think of an isa as like a completely normal savings account except that you do n't pay tax on the interest and there is a limit to how much you can deposit in any given year   right now while interest rates have been low for a while the savings rates on any account including isas are not desperately attractive additionally with the recent changes to how interest on normal savings accounts are taxed isas are not quite such a big deal as they used to be   if you look back to a time when interest rates were around 5 a higher rate tax payer with £ 50,000 in a normal savings account would earn £ 2500 interest in a year on which they would pay £ 1000 in tax that made an isa a very attractive option indeed

the point is that the bid and ask prices dictate what you can buy and sell at at market at least and the difference between the two or spread contributes implicitly to your gains or losses for example say your $ 1 stock actually had a bid of $ 0.90 and an ask of $ 1.10 i.e. say that $ 1 was the last price you would have to buy the stock at the ask price of $ 1.10 but now you can only sell that stock at the bid price of $ 0.90 thus you would need to make at least that $ 0.20 spread before you can make a profit

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

that sounds about right however and this is just a quibble it 's not 90 m notional of swap or at least i 've not heard it expressed quite that way for a total return instrument generally i hear the word exposure in this case the of shares purchased at a specific index level so 90 mm exposure in s&amp;p 500 at today 's closing price is = a swap on 37 shares   if you want to maintain the 90 mm exposure month to month you will structure the instrument with a variable notional at each reset the swap 's of shares will vary inversely with the index level to maintain the 90 mm exposure   you rightly point out that the financing is based on the 90 mm figure   as a final note the dealer may also guarantee some profit by quoting a spread between the swap 's initial index levels depending on whether the portfolio wants to go long or short the index

the fact that your ex is on the mortgage limits their ability to get more loans while you have been making the payments on time if you had any problems making those payments it would have also impacted their credit score it is understandable that they would like to be released from the mortgage the options that they have are limited you would have to refinance the mortgage lenders do n't just drop borrowers from a mortgage unless they have determined that the remaining people on the mortgage can make the payments besides the mortgage ownership documents were probably filed with the local government the refinancing process will require a signature by your ex unless the earlier agreement documents removed your ex as an owner and those were filed with the authorities regarding an exchange of funds it can be negotiated an attempt was done with the earlier agreement if the documents that were signed are proof of the agreement ca n't be determined by the internet how this is settled is outside the scope of this site it depends on what documents have been signed in the past the jurisdiction involved and the state of the relationship at the time of the purchase and at the time of the refinancing

you remind me a lot of myself as i was thinking about marriage luckily for me my wife was much smarter about all this than i was hopefully i can pass along some of her wisdom both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both do n't want to take money from each other in marriage there is no more financial independence do not think in those terms life can throw so many curve balls that you will regret it imagine sitting down with your new bride and running through the math she is to contribute $ x to the family each month and you are to contribute $ y. then next thing you know 6 months later she has cancer and has to undergo expensive and debilitating treatment there is no way she can contribute her $ x anymore you tell her that is okay and that you understand but the pressure weighs down on her every day because she feels like she is not meeting your expectations   or alternatively everything goes great with your $ x $ y plan a few years down the road your wife is pregnant so you revisit the plan readjust etc everything seems great when your child is born however the baby has a severe physical or mental handicap you and your wife decide that she will quit her job to raise your beautiful child but the whole time in the back of her mind she ca n't get out of her head that she is no longer financially independent and not living up to your expectations these stresses are not what you want in your marriage here is what we do in my family hopefully some of this will be helpful to you every year my wife and i sit down and determine what our financial goals are for the year how much do we want to be putting in retirement how much do we want to give to charity do we want to take any family vacations we set goals together on what we want to achieve with our money there is no my money or her money just ours does n't matter where it comes from at the beginning of every month we create a budget in a spreadsheet it has categories like food mortgage or rent transportation clothing utilities and we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those it also has categories for entertainment retirement charity cell phones internet and so on again we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those in the spreadsheet we also track how much income we expect that month and our totals income minus expenses if that value is positive we determine what to do with the remainder maybe we save some for a rainy day or for car repairs maybe we treat ourselves to an extra fancy dinner the point is every dollar should be accounted for if she wants to go to dinner with some friends we put that in the budget if i want a new video game we put that in the budget once a week we take all our receipts and tally up where we spent our money we then see how we are doing on our budget maybe we were a little high in one category and lower than expected in another we adjust we are flexible but we go over our finances often to make sure we are achieving our goals some specific goals i 'd recommend that the two of you consider in your first such yearly meeting you get out of life what you put into it and you will get out of your finances what the two of you put into them by being on the same page your marriage will be much happier money finances are one of the top causes of divorce if you two are working together on this you are much more likely to succeed

you have to understand what risk is and how much risk you want to take on and weight your portfolio accordingly   i think your 80/20 split based on wrong assumptions is the wrong way to look at it   it sounds like your risk appetite has changed risk is deviation from expected so risk is not bad and you can have cases where everyone would prefer the riskier asset    if you think the roulette table is too risky instead of betting $ 1 stick in your pocket and you changed the payoffs from $ 2 or 0 to or $ 1.50 if your risk appetite has changed change your risk exposure   if not then all you are saying is i bought the wrong stuff earlier now i should get out

ditto rocky also break the sale up over several tax years so that you do n't have a spike in your income pushing you into a higher tax bracket do n't sell it until you retire when you 're probably in a lower tax bracket if you 're 20 this may be impractical get some other deductions like medical expenses charity etc failing that maybe a couple of other ideas that neither of us thought of i think the real answer is suck it up and pay the taxes if there was a way to reduce your taxes just by checking the right box on a tax form or some such everybody would do it and the government would n't collect any taxes

you could end up with nothing yes   i imagine those that worked at enron years ago if their 401(k was all in company stock would have ended up with nothing to give an example here   however more likely is for you to end up with less than you thought as you see other choices as being better that with the benefit of hindsight you wish you had made different choices the strategies will vary as some people will want something similar to a set it and forget it kind of investment and there may be fund choices where a fund has a targeted retirement date some years out into the future   these can be useful for people that do n't want to do a lot of research and spend time deciding amongst various choices   other people may prefer something a bit more active   in this case you have to determine how much work do you want to do do you want to review fund reviews on places like morningstar and do periodic reviews of your investments etc   what works best for you is for you to resolve for yourself as for risks here are a few possible categories time how many hours a week do you want to spend on this   how much time learning this do you want to do in the beginning   while this does apply to everyone you have to figure out for yourself how much of a cost do you want to take here volatility some investments may fluctuate in value and this can cause issues for some people as it may change more than they would like   for example if you invest rather aggressively there may be times where you could have a -50 return in a year and that is n't really acceptable to some people inflation similarly to those investments that vary wildly there is also the risk that with time prices generally rise and thus there is something to be said for the purchasing power of your investment   if you want to consider this in more detail consider what $ 1,000,000 would have bought 30 years ago compared to now currency risk some investments may be in other currencies and thus there is a risk of how different denominations may impact a return fees how much do your fund 's charge in the form of annual expense ratio   are you aware of the charges being taken to manage your money here

this is second hand information as i am not a millionaire but i work with such people everyday and have an understanding of how they handle cash the wealthy people do n't simple definitely not if they do n't have to cash is a tool to them that they use only if they get benefit of it being a cash transaction one of my friends is a re seller and he gets a 10 discount from suppliers for settling lines using cash everything else they place on a line of credit for people who dislike credit cards and pay using atm or debit cards might actually have a very poor understanding of leverage i assure you the wealthy people have a very good understanding of it frankly wealthy people pay less for everything but they deserve it because of the extreme amount of leverage they have built for themselves their aprs are low their credit limits are insanely high they have longer billing periods and they get spoiled by credit card vendors all the time for example when you buy your groceries at walmart you pay at least a 4 markup because that 's the standardized cost of processing credit cards even if you paid in cash a wealthy person uses his credit card to pay for the same but earns the same percentage amount in cash back points and what not i am sure littleadv placed the car purchase on his credit card for similar reasons the even more wealthy have their groceries shipped to their houses and if they pay cash i wo n't be surprised if they actually end up paying much less for fresh organic vegetables than what equivalent produce at walmart would get them i apologize for not being able to provide citations for these points i make as they are personal observations

yes stock price is determined by the last trade price there are always going to be people who have put in a price to buy a stock called a bid price and people who have put in a price to sell a stock called an ask price based on your example if the last trade price for the stock was $ 1.23 then you might have the following bid prices and ask prices so if you put in a limit order to buy 100 shares at $ 100 you would buy the 40 shares at $ 1.23 the 15 shares at $ and the 45 shares $ 1.25   the price of the stock would go up to $ 1.25 conversely if you put in a limit order to sell 100 shares at $ 0.01 i do n't think any broker would allow a sell price of $ 0.00 you would sell 30 shares at $ 20 shares at $ and 50 shares at $ 1.20   the price of the stock would go down to $ 1.20

you can you can take out a conventional mortgage and keep the cash   a mortgage is nothing but a secured loan against your home you can open a heloc and treat it as a negative equity bank account note that both a mortgage and a heloc tend to have significant up front or administrative costs attached to them   it costs the loaning institution some money to ensure they are in a safe position and they will want to pass it on to you they do n't want you taking out such a loan and not using it on the other hand the interest rates on such a loan are often much lower than interest rates on other loans if you have a reliable source of significant income getting a completely unsecured line of credit may be possible with a rate only a few percentage points higher than a heloc without having to pay a cent in fees   the bank does n't have to appraise your home or ensure ownership before such a loan just assess income which is easy especially if you have a regular paycheck auto deposited into an account at the same branch toss in some signatures from your employer and good to go if that is feasible you could end up with a lower rate   withdraw from the line of credit pay off your other loans then work to repay the line of credit if an unsecured line of credit has a rate 1 3 higher than a secured one and you are borrowing 5000 $ against it and pay it off over 2 years the total interest you would save from a secured line is about note that in some jurisdictions your home is protected against loss from bankruptcy unless you have used it as collateral for a loan or it is easier to claim the home if you are insolvent if you have used it as collateral   determining what the consequences of securing your loan against the house could itself be expensive

this can be done and there have been many good suggestions on things to do and watch out for   but to my shock i do n't see anyone offering any words of caution about property managers whatever you do do n't assume they have your best interests at heart   do not assume that no news is good news and that if you are n't hearing of problems and are just collecting rent checks everything must be fine you can easily end up with tenants you would never have allowed yourself or tenants with pets that you would not have allowed etc   especially if the manager does n't want you to have a vacancy and potentially lose you as a client they may very well lower their standards just to get the place occupied   and a year or two or three later you may find yourself looking at a very large repair bill and wonder how on earth it could have happened when you supposedly had someone looking out for your property there are quality ethical property managers out there   they are not all bad to be certain   but whatever you do check up on them   and with multiple properties especially if in multiple areas states etc this can be nearly a full time job in itself   as the saying goes trust but verify   i have never found this to apply more than with rental properties and property management do n't leave anything significant to them 100   you ca n't even assume that a rule like all expenses over $ 50 must be cleared by me first as that can simply mean that they do n't bother to come to you for certain kinds of repairs that would cost more than that or that they just get them taken care of by their own person done poorly illegally etc and never tell you   never trust their choice of tenants blindly   visit the place yourself at least every few months a quick at a minimum or better if you can arrange a reason to walk through the house personally   check the back yard never assume that the front yard is indicative of anything else   never assume that a no pets rule will be followed or that tenants would n't lie to the management about having pets   never assume that the tenants wo n't move additional people into the property as well always expect a bare minimum of 1 month vacancy every year and an additional minimum of 1 month 's rental revenue in unexpected maintenance repairs every year   this is at a minimum   you might do much better than this and have a high quality tenant in place for years who costs next to nothing in extra maintenance   but do not count on it rental real estate investing looks so simple on paper where it 's just numbers   but reality has a very rude habit of surprising you when you least expect it after all no one expects the spanish good luck

there is a subtle difference   in an fdic insured bank account you are guaranteed to get all of your money back out if you put $ 1000 into your bank account you are guaranteed to be able to get at least $ 1000 back out when you want the value of the account in dollars can never go down for any reason   when you put money into a brokerage account cash is typically invested in a money market fund money market funds are considered very safe investments with low risk of loss and a corresponding low rate of return   however it is possible for the value of a money market fund to go down and sipc insurance does not cover that   what sipc does cover is any sort of shenanigans that a broker might play on you if they screw up and delete your account or give your money to someone else or close up shop and head to grand cayman sipc ensures that you will get your money back but it does not cover investment losses

broadly there 's a bunch of stuff you need to be accounting for that 's not reflected in the above which will impact the a d profile of an acquisition   consideration paid all cash on substantially the same terms is going to be more accretive than an all stock transaction because in the latter your denominator is much bigger   shares outstanding including repurchases in kind dividends and option exercise   financing interest expense   upside base downside case for all of your assumptions best to have a based on a choose function that will allow the user to easily between these   i 'm not sure what ebitda is getting you eps accretion dilution typically looks at earnings but you could also look at cash eps a d which measures shares outstanding   the point is this really depends on how back of the envelope you want the a d computation to be at a minimum you need an earnings schedule projected over the next 2 3 years and you need a schedule reflecting outstanding shares over the same time period   your earnings can have varying degrees of granularity you can project cost synergies over the forecast period which most obviously is going to affect your earnings but you can also drill down further financing transaction fees etc your and from your b s combination may result in certain deferred tax items that will affect your bottom line over the forecast period   your share schedule can also have varying degrees of complexity one way to do it is to just presume that the company will not issue any more shares and will not repurchase any shares and that there will be no options exercised over the forecast period this is a bad series of assumptions it is likely that as options vest if in the money they will be exercised resulting in dilution for existing shareholders it is also likely that certain preferred shareholders and are going to experience adjustments to the conversion prices based on provisions in their securities these may be but are not always disclosed in the 10k.   last point models are tools what are you trying to build an accretion dilution model for this will affect and determine the degree of granularity you 'll want to go into

while this question is old and i generally agree with the answers given i think there 's another angle that needs a little insurance if you go with an 84 month loan your car will likely be worth less than the amount owed for substantially all of the entire 84 month loan period this will be exacerbated if you put zero down and include the taxes and fees in the amount borrowed   your lender will require you to carry full comprehensive collision liability coverage likely with a low maximum deductible   while the car is underwater it will probably also be a good idea to carry gap insurance because the last thing you want to do is write a check to your lender to shore up the loan to value deficit if the thing is totaled   these long term car loans i 've seen as high as 96 months are a bear when it comes to depreciation and related insurance costs there is more to this decision than the interest calculation    obviously if you had the cash at the front of this decision presumably you 'll have the cash later to pay off the loan at your convenience   but while the loan is outstanding there are costs beyond interest to consider

you need to run awareness campaign on facebook even something like $ can have a huge impact on letting people know you exist then post frequently at least 1 daily picture of something for sale in the shop    second collect emails at the counter a simple pen and paper list works surprisingly well get a free email account and email coupons once a week in the beginning you 'll want strong offers as you are building the list do n't waste peoples time with lame or no offers come hard with a huge coupon or they will after the first email this might cost you some money but do n't think of it as selling something for a loss think of it as a marketing expense   try groupon you are desperate this is where desperate local businesses go make a smart offer limit how they can spend it i would suggest focusing it on the cold brew as that has enough margin   partner with local coffee cup cake shops pretty much any one who will have you and give them free shelf space and get them to market to their facebook ig twitter followers about your location and that they can buy stuff there also this is huge and you can capitalize your local market   finally get over the attitude of no one supports local people do n't owe your mom their business just because she 's local she has to compete on price service and selection just like anyone else even amazon so reevaluate your prices your profit margins and start talking to the customers to see what they want in the store

the standard interpretation of can i afford to retire is can i live on just the income from my savings never touching the principal to estimate that you need to make reasonable guesses about the return you expect the rate of inflation your real costs remember to allow for medical emergencies major house repairs and the like when determining you average needs not to mention taxes if this is n't all tax sheltered and then build in a safety factor you said liquid assets and that 's correct you do n't want to be forced into a reverse mortgage by anything short of a disaster an old rule of thumb was that properly invested you could expect about 4 real return after subtracting inflation that may or may not still be correct but it makes an easy starting point if we take your number of $ 50k year today 's dollars and assume you 've included all the tax and contingency amounts that means your nest egg needs to be or $ i 'm figuring i need at least $ 1.8 m liquid assets to retire the $ 1.5 m you gave would under this set of assumptions allow drawing up to $ 60k year which gives you some hope that your holdings would mot just maintain themselves but grow giving you additional buffer against emergencies later having said that some folks have suggested that given what the market is currently doing it might be wiser to assume smaller average returns or you may make different assumptions about inflation or want a larger emergency buffer that 's all judgement calls based on your best guesses about the economy in general and your investments in particular   a good financial advisor not a broker will have access to better tools for exploring this using techniques like monte carlo simulation to try to estimate both best and worst cases and can thus give you a somewhat more reliable answer than this rule of thumb approach but that 's still probabilities not promises another way to test it find out how much an insurance company would want as the price of an open ended inflation adjusted $ 50k a year annuity making these estimates is their business if they ca n't make a good guess nobody can admittedly they 're also factoring the odds of your dying early into the mix but on the other hand they 're also planning on making a profit from the deal so their number might be a reasonable one for self insuring too or might not or you might decide that it 's worth buying an annuity for part or all of this paying them to absorb the risk in the end ya pays yer money and takes yer

depends on what you mean by communism also whether or not a basic income is viable is another question i 'm not trying to say i know all the answers but i 've thought a lot about the future some worry that a basic income would basically make the masses slaves in a way because it would n't solve income inequality it would make people dependent on a government hand out    another option is to disperse labor instead of working 40 hours a week they work 30 20 or less but this solution might only be temporary until humans are simply not cost effective the question will be why are we working and why create machines to alleviate human labor and serve human life or to extract as much as possible from earth regardless of human life to horde a big pile of resources regardless of whether or not humans exist to use them

we ’re buying the home right over $ 200,000 so that means he will only need to put down as a roughly $ 7000 i 'm with the others do n't call this a gift unless it is a gift    i 'd have him check with the bank that previously refused him a mortgage if putting both of you on a mortgage would their concerns   your cash flow would be paying the mortgage payment and if you failed to do so then they could fall back on his   that may make more sense to them even if they would deny each of you a loan on your own   this works for them because either of you is responsible for the whole loan   it works for him because he was already willing to be responsible for the whole loan   and your alternative plan makes you responsible for the whole loan so this is just as good for you    at what percentage would you suggest splitting ownership and future expenses typically a cash financing partnership would be 50/50 but since it ’s only a 3.5 down payment instead of 20 is that still fair surprisingly enough a 3.5 down payment that accumulates is about half the equity of a 20 down payment   so your suggestion of a split makes sense if 20 would give a split    i expected it to be considerably lower   the way that i calculated it was to have his share increase by his equity share of the rent which i set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty year loan   with a 20 down payment this would give him 84 equity   with 3.5 about 40 equity   i 'm not sure why 84 equity should be the equivalent of a 50 share but it may be a side effect of other expenses   perhaps taking property taxes out would reduce the equity share    note that if you increase the down payment to 20 your mortgage payment will drop substantially   the difference in interest between 3.5 and 20 equity is a couple hundred dollars   also you 'll be able to eliminate any pmi payment at 20    it could be argued that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment that that would give him the same 50 equity stake on a 3.5 down payment as he would get with a 20 down payment   the problem there is that then he is effectively subsidizing your monthly payment   if he were to stop doing that for some reason you 'd have what is effectively a 50 increase in your rent   it would be safer for you to handle the monthly payment while he handles the down payment    if you could n't pay the mortgage it sounds like he is in a position to buy out your equity rent the property and take over the mortgage payment   if he stopped being able to pay his third of the mortgage it 's not evident that you 'd be able to pick up the slack from him much less buy him out   and it 's unlikely that you 'd find someone else willing to replace him under those terms   but your brother could construct things such that in the face of tragedy you 'd inherit his equity in the house   if you 're making the entire mortgage payment that 's a stable situation    he 's not at risk because he could take over the mortgage if necessary   you 're not at risk because you inherit his equity share and can afford the monthly payment   so even in the face of tragedy things can go on   and that 's important as otherwise you could lose your equity in the house

there 's two scenarios the loan accrues interest on the remaining balance or the total interest was computed ahead of time and your payments were averaged over x years so your payments are always the same the second scenarios is better for the bank so guess what you probably have in the first scenario i would pay it off to avoid paying interest unless there is a compelling reason to keep the cash available for something else and you do n't mind paying interest in the second case you 're going to pay interest over x years as computed when you bought the car no matter how quickly you pay it off so take your time if you pay it earlier it 's like paying interest that would not have actually accrued since you 're paying it off faster than necessary if you pay it off i 'm not sure if it would close the account your credit history might show the account as being paid which is a good thing

well i answered a very similar question credit card payment date where i showed that for a normal cycle the average charge is n't due for 40 days the range is 35 55 so if you want to feel good about the float just charge everything the day after the cycle closes and nothing else the rest of the month why is this so interesting it 's no trick and no secret   by the way this is n't likely to be of any use when you 're buying gas groceries or normal purchases but i suppose if you have a large purchase say a big tv $ 3000 this will buy you extra time to pay it would be of me to not clearly state that anyone who needs to take advantage of this trick is the same person who probably should n't use credit cards at all those who use cards are best served by charging what they can afford to pay at that moment and not base today 's charges on what paychecks will come in by the due date of the credit card bill

fixed   you are confirming the amount you are going t pay over the term of the loan variable over the total difference over the life of the loan comes to around $ 1200 that is the wrong way to calculate the variable portion the variable is primarily set with a margin over a certain benchmark i.e. fed rate assuming the fed rate does n't change over or only goes lower the variable rate is the one to go if it rises then your payment will increase and the margin they take over the benchmark rate may increase so the total amount you pay might increase too   i would assume a read through the t&cs should clarify that for you is it ever a good idea to choose a variable rate loan only if you think we are in a low interest rate environment i.e. the economy is in and the feds are trying to simulate the economy by decreasing the benchmark rates and you are sure that the lender is n't going to increase his margins if the rate remains low for quite a substantial amount of time and i might assume there will be penalties for paying off a loan quicker

let me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers   note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use not for renting out there 's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year 's cold rents it is considered rather expensive i do n't know how localized this rule of thumb is but i know it for germany which is apparently the op 's country too there are obviously differences between buying a house flat for yourself and in order to rent it out as others have said maintenance is a major factor for house owners and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs which is closely related to financial risk exposure e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day time job   this plays a crucial role for landlords i know they 're all small scale landlords and most of them do put in substantial work themselves i know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case i also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that nice kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants do n't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance    my personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment i.e. not for immediate or future personal use i 'd say that the exact circumstances are very important if you are based in a region where the buying to rental price ratio is favorable you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house then why not if this is not the case some other form of investing in real estate may be better on the other hand investing in further real estate where you live in your own house means increased lump risk you miss diversification into regions where the value of real estate may develop very differently   there is one important psychological point that may play a role with the observed relation between being rich and being landlord first of all remember that the median wealth without pensions for germany is about 51 k€ and someone owning a morgage free 150 k€ flat and nothing else is somewhere in the 7th of wealth to put it the other way round the question whether to invest 150 k€ into becoming a landlord is of practical relevance only for rich in terms of wealth people also asking this question is typically only relevant for people who already own the home they live in as buying for personal use will typically have a better return than buying in order to rent but already people who buy for personal use are on average wealthier or at least on the track to become more wealthy in case of fresh home owners than people who rent this is attributed to personal characteristics and the fact that the downpayment of the mortgage enforces saving behaviour which is typically kept up once the house is paid and is anyways found to be more pronounced than for non house owners in contrast many people who decide never to buy a home fall short of their initial savings investment plans e.g. putting the 150 k€ into an etf for the next 21 years and in the end spend considerably more money and this group of people rarely invests into directly becoming a landlord   assuming that you can read german here 's a relevant newspaper article and a related press release

you should be worried you have made the mistake of entering an investment on the recommendation of family friend the last think you should do is make another mistake of just leaving it and hoping it will go up again your stock has dropped from its high of $ that means it has to go up over 60 just to reach the high of $ you are correct this may never happen or if it does it could take a long long time to get up to its previous highs what is the company doing to turn its fortunes around take a look at some other examples airways   this stock reached a high of around $ 6 in late 2007 after a nice uptrend over a year and a half it then dropped drastically at the start of the gfc and has since kept falling and is now priced at just $ 1.15 reported its first ever loss earlier this year but its problems were evident much earlier aapl apple inc.   aapl reach a high of just over $ 700 in september 2013 then dropped to around $ 400 and has recovered a bit to about $ 525 still 25 below its highs and looks to be at the start of another downtrend how long will it take aapl to get back to $ 700 more than 33 from its current price ten network holdings limited   ten reached a high of $ in late 2004 after a nice uptrend during 2004 it then started a steep journey downwards and is still going down it is now priced at just $ 0.25 a whopping 94 below its high it will have to increase by 1600 just to reach its high of $ which i think will never happen can a stock come back from a drastic downtrend yes it can it does n't always happen but a company can turn around and can reach and even surpass it previous highs the question is how and when will this happen how long will you keep your capital tied up in a stock that is going nowhere and has every chance of going further down the most important thing with any investment is to protect your current capital if you lose all your capital you can not make any new investments until you build up more capital that is why it is so important to have a risk management strategy and decide what is your get out point if things go against you before you get into any new investment have a stop loss i would get out of your investment before you lose more capital if you had set a stop loss at 20 off the stock 's last highs you would have gotten out at about $ 28 higher than the current share price of $ if you do further analysis on this company and find that it is improving its prospects and the stock price breaks up through its current ranging band then you can always buy back in however do you still want to be in the stock if it breaks the range band on the downside in this case who knows how low it can continue to go this is my opinion as others would have theirs and what i would do in your current situation with this stock

everyone else seems to have focused rightly so on the negatives of credit cards high interest rates and why it is important to pay them off before interest starts accruing only 's answer briefly touched on rewards   to me this is the real purpose of credit cards in today 's age   most good rewards cards can get you anywhere from 1 2 cash back on all purchases and sometimes more on other categories   again assuming you can pay the balance in full each month and you are good at budgeting money using a credit card is an easy way to basically discount 1 2 of all of the spending you put on your card   again this only works to your advantage if you pay off the credit card in full using the above example of 20 interest that 's about 1.6 interest if the interest compounds monthly which wipes out your return on rewards if you just go one month without paying off the balance

etf creation and redemption process notes the process while etf trading occurs on an exchange like stocks the process by    which their shares are created is significantly different unless a    company decides to issue more shares the supply of shares of an    individual stock trading in the marketplace is finite when demand    increases for shares of an etf however authorized participants aps    have the ability to create additional shares on demand through an in kind transfer mechanism aps create etf units in the    primary market by delivering a basket of securities to the fund equal    to the current holdings of the etf in return they receive a large    block of etf shares typically 50,000 which are then available for    trading in the secondary market this etf creation and redemption    process helps keep etf supply and demand in continual balance and    provides a hidden layer of liquidity not evident by looking at    trading volumes alone this process also works in reverse if an investor wants to sell a    large block of shares of an etf even if there seems to be limited    liquidity in the secondary market aps can readily redeem a block of    etf shares by gathering enough shares of the etf to form a creation    unit and then exchanging the creation unit for the underlying    securities thus the in kind swap to the underlying securities is only done by aps so the outflow would be these individuals taking a large block of the etf and swapping it for the underlying securities   the aps would be taking advantage of the difference between what the etf 's trading value and the value of the underlying securities

i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

many european countires allow you to an account for non residents you have to appear in the bank personally to open it some of them even to get your own tax number for non residents from the local government   i 'm not sure if you get a visa chip card or you have to wait for like 3 months before being issued one i 've heard that getting a tax number for non residents and opening a bank account is easily done in one day in republic of they seem to have agile local bureaucracy and banks since many from non eu countries used to come there to open an eu bank account funds can be transfered via internet banking us banks have that do they swift and iban codes are used for international money transfer but it takes some time days for it to arrive to destination below $ 20000 per month or per transaction are considered normal but for above that the destination bank might ask you to explain the purpose to prove it is not illegal some of them accept the in writing they forward it to the regulator that tracks such large transfers some of them ask you to appear there in person for an interview and to sign a statement ca n't believe us banks are still issuing stripe cards like it 's still 1980s i 'd expect europe to be 10 years behind usa in technology but this seems to be a weird reverse i 've using internet banking with one time tokens and tan lists for almost 10 years and chip cards for over 5y ca n't the last time i 've seen mag stripe card only american express event the regular green one got the chip at least 5 years ago and it is accepted regularly in europe it 's more popular in europe although mastercard is a definite 1 with visa close to that that in usa

one possibility is to lock in gains by selling where a selling price can attempt to be optimized by initiating a trailing stop loss order you 'll have to look at the pros and cons of that kind of order to see if it is right for you another possibility is to begin hedging with options contracts if that security is puts with the appropriate delta will cost over time against future gains in the stock 's price but will protect your wealth if the stock price falls from this high point these possibilities depend on what your investment goals are for instance if you are buying no matter what price because you like the forward guidance of the company then it changes your capital growth and preservation decisions

i think it depends on your broker some brokers will not try to auto exercise in the money options others will try to do the exercise it if you have available funds your best bet if find yourself in that situation is to sell the option on the open market the day of or slightly before expiration put it on your calendar and do n't forget you could loose your profits its in the best interest of your broker to exercise because they get a commission i think they are used to this situation where there is a lack of funds its not like bouncing a check you will need to check with your broker on this i think many or most options traders never intend on buying the stock therefore no they do not always make sure there is enough funds to buy

this is a great idea and i ca n't think of any downside the best part about it is in the future when you have built up your emergency fund beyond the maximum contributions to the roth ira you can then move your roth funds into a higher yielding investment i might take it a step further in addition to this try to get a line of credit from your bank with no annual fee in case of emergency you can decide if you want to take the money from your roth or borrow from the line and pay some interest temporarily depending on the situation it may actually make sense to pay a little bit of interest and leave the money in the roth since over the long run the future earnings of that money could easily make you more than the interest you 'll pay for let 's hope a short amount of time to really hit home why your idea is fantastic

let 's pretend that the author of that article is not selling anything and is trying to help you succeed in life   i have nothing against sales but that author is throwing out a lot of nonsense to sell his stuff and is creating a state of urgency so that people adopt this mindset   it 's clever and it obviously works from a pure time perspective most people wo n't make enough money to run their own business and be as profitable as if they worked for a company   this is a reality that few want to acknowledge   if you invested in yourself and your career with the same discipline and urgency as an entrepreneur most people would be better off at a company when you consider the benefits and the fact that employees have a full 7.5 of social security paid by their employer entrepreneurs see the full 15 while employees do n't   why do i start here because this author is n't telling you that the more people take his advice the more their earnings will regress to the mean or below   in fact most of my entrepreneur friends have to go back to work when their reality fails after they burn through their savings 401ks are not a perfect system but there are more 401k millionaires now than ever before this and people who give the author 's advice are always looking to avoid doing what they need to do save for retirement   most people i know sadly realize this in their 50s when it 's too late and start trying to catch up   i do n't blame the author for this as he knows his article will appeal to younger people who do n't have the wisdom to see that his advice has n't been great for most   the reality is that for most people 401ks will provide tax advantaged savings that you can use when you 're older taxes will eat at your earnings so these accounts really help finally look at the article again especially the part you quote   he says inflation will carve out what you save yet inflation is less than 2   where is he getting this from   in the past decade we 've seen numerous deflationary and the market overall has come back from the fall in 2009   again this is n't good enough for this author so buy his stuff to learn how to succeed   there have been numerous decades that were much worse for investors than this past one

for a job doing that kind of stuff what is preferred is 4 year undergrad at ivy league school + 2 year mba at ivy league school and then several more years of experience which you can sort of get by interning while in school this will of course saddle you with debt which is counterintuitive to your plans basically the easy way up is percentage based compensation without knowing the right people you will get a piss poor salary regardless of what you do in the beginning so portfolio managers earn money by percentage based fees and can manage millions and billions real estate agents can earn money by percentage based commissions if they close a property and other business venture owners can do the same thing the problem with how to trade books is that they are outdated by the time they are published so you should just stick with literature that teaches a fundamental knowledge of the products you want to trade make money from ultimately regardless of how you get earn your initial capital you will still need to be an individual investor to grow your own capital this has nothing to do with being a portfolio manager even highly paid individuals on wall street are in debt to lavish expenditures and have zero capital for their own investments hope this helps you really need to be thinking in a certain way to just quickly deduce good ideas from bad ideas

the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

anthony russell i agree with johnfx petroleum is used in making many things such as asphalt road oil plastic jet fuel etc it 's also used in some forms of electricity generation and some electric cars use gasoline as a backup form of energy petrol is also used in electricity generation outside of cars source can be found here but to answer your question of why shares of electric car companies are not always negatively related to one another deals with supply and demand if investors feel positively about petroleum and petroleum related prospects then they are going to buy or attempt to buy shares of x petrol company this will cause the price of x petrol company to rise ceteris paribus just because the price of petroleum is high does n't mean investors are going to buy shares of an electric car company petrol prices could be high but numerous electric car companies could be doing poorly now with that being said you could argue that sales of electric cars may go up when petrol prices are high but there are numerous factors that come into play here i think it would be a good idea to do some more research if you are planning on investing also remember after a company goes public they no longer set the price of the shares of their stock the price of company x shares are determined by supply and demand which is inherently determined by investors attitudes and expectations ultimately defined by past company performance expectations of future performance earnings etc it could be that when the market is doing well it 's a good sign of other macroeconomic variables employment gdp incomes etc and all these factors power how often individuals travel vacation etc it also has to deal with the economy of the country producing the oil when you have opec countries selling petrol to the u.s. it is likely much cheaper per barrel than domestic produced and refined petrol because of the labor laws etc so a strong economy may be somewhat correlated with oil prices and a strong market but it 's not necessarily the case that strong oil prices drive the economy i think this is a great research topic that can not be answered in one post check this article here from here you can track down what research the fed of cleveland has done concerning this my advice to you is to not believe everything your peers tell you but to research everything your peers tell you with just a few clicks you can figure out the legitimacy of many things to at least some degree

the issue is that the lender used two peoples income debts and credit history to loan both of you money to purchase a house the only way to get a person off the loan is to get a new loan via refinancing the new loan will then be based on the income debt and credit history of one person there is no paperwork you can sign or the ex spouse can sign that will force the original lender to remove somebody from the loan there is one way that a exchange of money between the two of you could work the ex spouse will have to sign paperwork to prove that it is not a loan that you will have to payback i picked the number 20 k for a reason if the amount of the payment is above 14 k they will have to document for the irs that this is a gift and the amount above 14 k will be counted as part of their estate when they die if the amount of the payment is less than 14 k they do n't even have to tell the irs if the ex has or you have the multiple payments can be constructed to exceed the 14 k limit

in theory yes it makes sense to sell your current bonds in pursuit of higher yields in practice there are a lot of smart people out there who own bonds and the market is very efficient so you wo n't see opportunities to trade new bonds for old bonds with better yields from the same issuer if you do find someone willing to buy your old bond for a higher amount it probably points to a change in the contract that the new bonds were issued under see argentina for an example

diversification is one aspect to this question and dr fred touches on its relationship to risk   another aspect is leverage so it again comes down to your appetite for risk   a further factor is that if you are successfully renting out your property someone else is effectively buying that asset for you or at least paying the interest on the mortgage just bear in mind that if you get into a situation where you have 10 properties and the rent on them all falls at the same time as the property market crashes sound familiar then you can be left on the hook for a lot of interest payments and your assets may not cover your liabilities

employers are not supposed to give cash gifts to their employees even if you try to call it a gift for tax purposes presumably the reason your wife 's employer gave her cash was to be nice and save her taxes on that amount her employer already paid tax on that money so that your wife does n't have to if she plans to declare it anyway then she should instead give it back and ask for it to be added to the w2 as an end of year bonus this way her employer could then deduct the payment and pay her a larger amount of money the additional amount would be approximately their tax rate minus about for fica in fact if your wife 's tax rate is more than 15 lower than her employer 's then this is actually mathematically best for both parties

if the balance on the low rate loan is very high say an student loan at 6 that accumulates interest every year and the balance on the high rate loan say a cc at 18 is comparatively very small then you 'd want to make sure that you 've at least stopped the bleeding on the high balance loan before starting to pay off the cc

this was called financial by edward s. shaw and ronald i. from stanford financial is the situation when government is stealing from people who rely heavily on saving rather then on spending meaning that your saving rates will be a lot worse then inflation rate financial markets are artificially hot and interest rates artificially low average historical interest rate is 10 this could be a possible predictor state to hyper inflation

in my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now 100 of the time it is not true of course i ca n't guarantee that is universally the case but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later or tomorrow or next week it 's extremely likely that they 'll still take your money for the original price in fact sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the excellent offer most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a this price is only good right now pitch it ends up being because they do n't want you to go search the competition and read reviews in this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price sales is an art and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it this particular salesperson obviously you and/or you do n't have an easily vulnerability i would n't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase if you are worried about the scenario of someone else up the item consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you reflect and/or arrange for the funds

gt;many of you might think that ’s not a budget issue because individuals pay the premiums but keep in mind we are subsidizing either partially or completely 25 million people under the affordable care act and rising premiums for those people will indeed mean an increase in the deficit within a few years that could add $ 200 billion to the deficit   unless we figure out how to control healthcare costs     that was the initial thought it 's turning out to seriously not be the case more people than the initial cbo prediction are being subsidized and much more heavily    it 's no wonder that the insurance company 's enjoy aca it 's free money for them they can raise rates but their customers do n't receive higher bills just the government pays more

tax deducted at source is applicable to employee employer contract employee relations it was also made applicable for cases where an indian company pays for software products like ms word etc as the product is not sold but is licensed and is treated as royalty unlike sale of a consumer product that you have say car hence it depends on how your contract is worded with your india clients best is have it as a service agreement although services are also taxed however your contract should clearly specify that any tax in india would be borne by your indian client cross country taxation is an advanced area you will not find good advice free

as a buyer one of the easiest ways to save on closing costs is to avoid title insurance   this will only apply if you are a cash buyer as a mortgage writer will typically require title insurance    it is also one of the most ill advised ways to save money   you need title insurance    for the most part there is really no way to truly save on closing costs   wrapping costs into a loan saving on interest or taxes through timing do n't truly save money   sometimes you can obtain discounts on closing by using an targeted lender but that may cost you in higher interest rates    by paying points on your loan you may increase your costs at closing in order to save money on interest paid    certainly you ca n't discount required government imposed fees like doc stamps    you may be able to shop around and find a bit lower fees for appraisal credit reports title company fees and title insurance   however that is a lot of work for not a lot of return   title companies seem to be pretty tight about their fees    the best yield of your time is to get the other party in the transaction to pay your costs   the market or local tradition may not allow this   an additional way to lower your costs is to ask the realtors involved to discount their commissions   however they could always say no    the bottom line is transacting real estate is very expensive

legal tender is by law any denominations of money printed by the bank of canada   there is an exclusion to this in that it must also be acceptable to both parties of the transaction   see the following link from the bank of canada on legal tender and look at the answer to the question of what is legal tender the reason retailers may refuse the legal tender is in the case of counterfeit prevention   the stores that purchase the scanning machines are trying to be accommodating by deferring the decision to refuse the legal tender after verifying it checking if it is acceptable

this is somewhat of a non answer but i 'm not sure you 'll ever find a satisfying answer to this question because the premises on which the question is based on are flawed   money itself does not exist physically at least not in the same sense that a product you buy does it simply does not make sense to say that you physically own money you can build a product out of but you can not build a money out of if you could then you could print your own money actually you can try to print your own money but nobody would knowingly accept it and thus is it functionally to real money the paper has no intrinsic value its value is derived from the fact that other people perceive it as valuable and nowhere else ergo paper money is no different than electronic money it is for this reason that if i were you i would be okay with online forex trading

in my district it clearly hurts it there are highly incompetent teachers teaching because the only requirement for tenure is that you work for three years in the district since hiring people is a hugely cumbersome process in my district it is often easier to just keep a mediocre incompetent teacher than it is to hire somebody new this is even more true after they have received tenure   i understand the idea of due process that is talking about but it is so easy to receive tenure and so hard to fire tenured teachers that it does not actually cause that

i think what he was confused about is why ev is used if a company like apple is going to have an ev much less than its market cap his point was if ev was the only way to measure the value of a firm a company that hordes cash like appl should be more valuable than its ev indicates    i think he failed to take into account that hording cash means the company is n't reinvesting in itself like it should and therefore at the time of a transaction when the cash exits the balance sheet you get significantly less in terms of remaining value    i can definitely see why people might get confused on ev though

a lot of these firms consist of ex mckinsey consulting people that know how to evaluate operations efficiency etc   like any company operating plans are presented by mgmt to the board and implemented by management   the pe firm works with management to design the operating strategy and that may be done in house pe firm and/or with outside in the industry   operational performance is important but unfortunately a lot of pe firms really only engage in financial engineering   the more industry sector specific the pe the firm the more value they likely add as a generalization

pay off the highest interest loan rate first you must be doing something funky with how long your terms are if you give a bit more info about your loan 's such as the term and how much extra you have right now to spend it could be explained in detail why that would be the better choice using your numbers you have to make sure when you are analyzing your different loan options that you make sure you are comparing apples to apples ie make sure that you are either comparing the present value future value or amortization payments   edit using some of your numbers lets say you have 5000 dollars in your pocket you have 3 options excel makes these calculations easier do nothing in 80 months your student loan will be payed in full and you will have owing on your mortgage and 5000 in your no bank interest   for mortgage pay off student loan and allocate student loans amortization to mortgage in 80 months you will have $ owing on mortgage and student loan will be paid in full for mortgage pay 5000 on mortgage in 80 months student loan will be paid in full and you will have $ owing on mortgage for mortgage

corporations exist to generate profit and reduce risk for investors   this is a socially good and useful function that benefits us all   a corporation that did n't seek to lower its tax bill to the lowest legally allowed would be breaking the law   rather than show up at random times and whatever they could grab ahold of governments have discovered through trail and error that having clear consistent rules about how much they demand nets them more revenue   thus tax law and why it is important   over time governments have used tax law for social engineering purposes and as a mechanism for attempting to control their local economy because of this tax law has tended towards higher and higher complexity   throw territorial into the mix and tax law can be also used as a sort of economic weapon   all of this yields a complex tax code which mandates that businesses pay more and more attention to following it 's arcane rules if they want to remain in business   gaming the system is n't morally wrong it is what governments expect businesses to do otherwise they would n't spend so much time setting up such complex rules for business to follow   i suspect that there will be public outcry for more rules making the tax system even more complex because evil businesses are attempting to follow the rules   in a sane world governments would step back refrain from social and economic manipulation which they have shown themselves to be incompetent at anyway and create as simple a tax code as possible so that the tax code is no longer where businesses seek to gain advantage but rather focus their time and energy into creating better products services every dollar spent on tax lawyers accountants is a dollar not spent on making the business better   creating more rules to punish people for following the rules is insanity

according to this article with an all stock merger the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout the options on the bought out company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price but for a different number of shares normally one option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock for example company a buys company b exchanging 1/2 share of a for each share of b. options purchased on company b stock would change to options on company a with 50 shares of stock delivered if the option is exercised   this outcome strongly suggests that in general holders of options should cash out once the takeover is announced before the transactions takes place   since the acquiring company will typically offer a significant premium this will offer an opportunity for instant profits for call option holders while at the same time being a big negative for put option holders   however it is possible in some cases where the nominal price of the two companies favours the company ie the share prices of is lower than that of big the holder of a call option may wish to hold onto their options and possibly conversely for put option holders

generally i would say that you should pay it off if you have the money available why pay interest if you have the money that is of course if your money can earn you more than the interest you pay which can happen if you got a very low apr for your car loan but then you probably have excellent credit already and should n't care about the history of the loan on your report re the 7 years vs 2 years to the best of my knowledge its not true it will stay 7 years even if its closed during the first year
