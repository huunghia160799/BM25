there are no immediate tax related benefits to putting money into a roth ira you are investing after tax money in the hope that the rules wo n't change and you 'll be able to take out the money tax free when you retire under current rules you can take out your contributions at any time without penalties or taxes you ca n't take out earnings without penalties until you retire you said you do n't have any debt great so if you have cash that you do n't have other uses for and you do n't mind possibly tying it up for a long time you can put money into a roth ira i 'd argue that if you have say $ 25 50/month to put into long term savings it 's a good habit to start when you move into a job that gives you more disposable income you can increase this amount the earlier you start the lower the monthly amount you 'll need to contribute towards a comfortable retirement once you get started putting a little bit away you 'll never miss it

secret formulas are legal privileged information is not and that may be the whole point people are allowed to trade stocks profitably if doing so results only from their skill a secret formula for evaluating information is part of that skill but having privileged information is not considered skill it is considered an unfair illegal advantage because company officials and others with privileged information are 1 not permitted to trade stocks while that information is privileged and 2 are not allowed to share that information with others inevitably some do one or the other which is why they are prosecuted took the process to new highs or lows he not only dealt in privileged information he paid for it anything from a new car or house to $ 500,000 a year in cash in essence he had a bunch of strategically placed inside or close to corporations including one on the board of goldman sachs selling out their companies and thereby practicing a form of corporate treason

there are probably thousands of houses that you could buy if you want to buy a house it is very unlikely that the one you are renting right now is the best possible buy   usually people living in the houses they own are more interested in the quality of their property and the quality of their than people who are renting so i 'd say that you are generally better off finding a home to buy in an area where the majority own their homes

gt well they 've created what $ in the last few years   i agree with you technically but they control both the quantity and the quantity times velocity of money so they are also responsible for the lack of cashflow    the big thing i think you 're referring to is that they did this weird maneuver where they temporarily injected money into the banks basically so they could say they were solvent without actually being solvent because the were temporary the money never moved and was simply deposited at the fed if like adam smith you do n't consider money to really exist unless it moves they did not create effective money as you point out critically they did not create cashflow which is the appropriate macro definition of money the corresponding macro variable for this is ngdp   but actually the fed also controls ngdp as ben bernanke says every time the fomc makes its report they just choose not to increase it because they think that monetary policy is sufficiently i would agree with you that the present level of cashflow is inadequate but if the fed fixes it at the present level nothing will increase it this is called the critique was raising the issue to argue contra keynes that the multiplier on fiscal policy is 0 if you google it you can probably find someone to defend it better than me in any event this means it 's not very surprising that private spending and investment does n't lift ngdp nothing but the fed can lift ngdp because it can not create new cashflow on its own which it could under free banking this would be the advantage of free banking the market must now move to a new equilibrium ngdp level while it is saddled with a large number of contracts from before 2008 that were negotiated with respect to a higher expected ngdp level this deleveraging process is responsible for the present slump and the you describe

large of cash in the balance sheet with no debt means that you lack leverage and have an inefficient operating structure the argument being that i. the current market debt in germany is relatively cheap whole it is expensive in spain so my guess would be that they are trying to move the debt from the spanish unit where is it is becoming costly and dangerous to carry debt on the balance sheet to the german unit where there is still plenty of cash and thus debt to go around mind you this is a simplistic and limited interpretation of the article as i do not have the time to research this company and all it 's in depth

yes the distinction between how your funds are applied to principal vs interest is very important the interest amount charged each period probably monthly is not just one fixed sum calculated at the origination but rather is a dynamically calculated amount that changes each period relative to how much principal is remaining amount you owe   the picture you posted showing principal and interest assumes the payer always paid their minimum payment and never made any extra payments of principal take a look at the following graph and play around with the extra payment fields you will see some pretty drastic differences in the total interest paid green lines when extra payments are made

i 'm not familiar with the law and taxes in india but can provide guidance based on general accounting and tax principles you are right that receiving money as a loan is not income and is n't liable to income tax therefore i suggest you actually this loan through a written contract with your friend the contract should include all the usual elements of a loan amount interest even if preferential or zero principal term consequences of default and currency of loan you can then simply state the purpose of transfer as personal loan agreement if you have such a document and are questioned by tax authorities you can easily show that the inward remittance is from a loan and should therefore be treated like any commercial loan for tax purposes as long as you disclose the debt in your tax return if required in india and your friend discloses any interest received as income i think you 'll be above board and wo n't be liable for any income tax to make sure you might be better off having a quick consultation with an accountant or tax specialist in india to advise you and draft the loan agreement

the is from the merchant   to protect themselves a merchant requires payment before giving you your purchased item service that is why you are charged immediately   when getting a refund the same reason applies the merchant needs to ensure that you are returning the correct item or that it is still good or that you are not trying to defraud the merchant in some way once the merchant processes that refund it is all over for them and they have no recourse later if they find out they were cheated that is why they wait a while the delay gives them time to discover any problems

say the rate is 6 and the payment is $ 500/mo if the bank credits on the day received the .5 per month is $ 2.50 for the whole month in other words pulling in the payment by the full 30 days will save you about $ 2.50 the whole loan may be costing $ but you can only impact the amount one payment at a time   to be clear you need to find out exactly how they credit you some loans do not accept partial payments separate from the normal payment if a $ 500 payment is due that 's the time to prepay principal but they might not accept say $ 200 each week   as a side note mortgages typically do n't credit the way you 'd hope i have a standard 30 year mortgage and whether i send the payment a full 15 days early or 14 days late the next month shows a balance that i can pull from an amortization table assuming all payments are on the 1st of the month if i were you i 'd make a full payment 2 weeks early then check your balance and see what the impact was just to be sure

a reason to get an accountant is to avoid penalties for possible mistakes that is if you make a mistake the irs can impose penalties on you for negligence if the professional makes the same mistake the burden of proof for negligence shifts to the irs which probably means that you 'll pay more taxes and interest but no penalties hiring an accountant is prima evidence of not being negligent i would get an accountant since this the first time for you in the present situation when mistakes are most likely if you feel that s he did the same for you that you would have done for yourself then you might go back to doing your own taxes in later years

you 're absolutely right   that is why i eat at local restaurants instead of fast food   i get better food at a lower price   the real problem with fast food is institutional   typically you have a large public corporation with shareholders   i do not like shareholders   they usually want maximum returns but they do n't care about the business   they do n't have to work there and they do not make choices about the food or anything else   they only care about money   further most fast food chains are run by franchisees   they care more about the product but there 's still a lot of profit motive and they do n't have much if any control over corporate   so you end up with competing interests driven by profits and with that many people demanding money the product suffers and prices go up   i think this is a terrible model for delivering a quality product   all the forces at play are trying to things and increase profit   a small family run restaurant does n't have these problems   they know they need to make a good product at a fair price or they go out of business   without all the grasping hands that 's an easier and less expensive thing to do   which is why the small local restaurants get my business   they give me a better product at a lower price   i do n't think a company like mcdonald 's is capable of that unless they go private throw out their shit food and focus on delivering quality at a fair price   that 's just not possible with a shareholder franchise business model   it is not efficient

a couple of distinctions first if you were to invest in real estate were you planning to buy a home to live in or buy a home to rent out to someone else   buying a home as a primary residence really is n't investing in real estate per se   it 's buying a place to live rather than renting one   unless you rent a room out or get a multi family unit your primary residence wo n't be income producing   it will be income draining for the most part   i speak as a homeowner second if you are buying to rent out to someone else buying a single home is quite a bit different than buying an reit   the home is a lot less liquid the transaction costs are higher and all of your eggs are in one basket   having said that though if you buy one right and do your homework it can set you on the road for a very comfortable retirement

one of the main tax loopholes more readily available to the wealthy in the u.s. is the fact that long term capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate certainly people making less than $ can take advantage of this as well but the fact is that people making say $ likely have a much smaller proportion of their income available to invest in say indexed mutual funds or etfs you may wish to read wikipedia 's article on capital gains tax in the united states you can certainly make the argument that the preferential tax rate on capital gains is appropriate and the wikipedia article points out a number of these nevertheless this is one of the main mechanisms whereby people with higher wealth in the u.s. typically leverage the tax code to their advantage

is right you should put an hourly dollar value on your time   calculate a realistic number and keep it in the back of your mind then when you 're looking for a discount or a saving estimate the maximum amount that you 'd be able to save   this should be a realistic proportion of the value of the item   from those figures you can get the maximum amount of time that you should spend on looking for that discount spend any more than that amount of time and you lose money even if you get the discount   so then you can end up with a few rules of thumb like do n't spend more than x minutes of time per dollar of possible savings   then you can spend the spare time you 've created on looking for savings on big ticket items where the time is more efficiently used or on studying to upgrade your earning potential or on taking some time out to enjoy the world and sniff the flowers

i agree with all the people against working for free but i 'll also have a go at answering the question when do i see money related to that 5 is it only when they get    bought or is there some sort of quarterly payout of profits it 's up to the shareholders of the company whether and when it pays dividends a new startup will typically have a small number of people perhaps 1 3 who between them control any shareholder vote the and an investor if they 're offering you 5 chances are they 've made sure your vote will not matter but some companies an equity partnership springs to mind might be structured such that control is genuinely distributed you would want to check what the particular situation is in this company assuming the founders main investors have control those people or that person will decide whether to pay dividends so you can ask them their plans to realise money from the company it is very rare for startups to pay any dividends this is firstly because they 're rarely profitable but even when they are profitable the whole point of a startup is to grow so there are plenty of things to spend cash on other than payouts to shareholders paying anything out to shareholders is the opposite of receiving investment so unless you 're in the very unusual position of a startup that will quickly make so much money that it does n't need investment and is planning to pay out to shareholders rather than spend on growth then no it will not pay out one way for a shareholder to exit is to be bought out by other shareholders for example if they want to get rid of you then they might make you an offer for your 5 this can be any amount they think you 'll take given the situation at the time if you do n't take it there may be things they can do in future to reduce its value to you see below if you do take it then your 5 would pay you once when you leave if the company succeeds commonly it will be wholly or partly sold either privately or by ipo at this point if it 's wholly sold then the soon to be ex shareholders at the time will receive the proceeds of the sale if it 's partly sold then as with an investment round it 's up for negotiation what happens for example i believe the cash from an ipo of x% of the company could be taken into the company leaving the shareholders with no immediate direct payout but of shares in their names that they 're more or less free to sell or retain and receive future dividends alternatively if the company settles down as a small private business that 's no longer in startup mode it might start paying out without a sale if the company fails as most startups do it will never pay anything it 's very important to remember that it 's the shareholders at the time who receive money in proportion to their holding or as defined by the company articles if there are different classes of share just because you have 5 now does n't mean you 'll have 5 by that time because any new investment into the company in the mean time will dilute your shareholding it works like this note that i 've assumed for simplicity that the new investment comes in at equal value to the old investment this is n't necessarily the case it can be more or less according to the terms of the new investment voted for by the shareholders so the first line really is nominal value not necessarily the actual cash the founders put in therefore you should not think of your 5 as 5 of what you imagine a company like yours might eventually exit for at best think of it as 5 of what a company like yours might exit for if it receives no further investment whatsoever ah but wo n't the founders also have their holdings diluted and lose control of the company so they would n't do that well not necessarily look carefully at whether you 're being offered the same class of shares as the founders if not consider whether they can dilute your shares without diluting their own look also at whether a new investor could use the founders executive positions to give them new equity in the same way they gave you old equity without giving you any new equity look at whether the founders will themselves participate in future investment rounds using of cash that they own from other ventures when you ca n't afford to keep up look at whether new investors will receive a priority class of share that 's guaranteed at exit to pay out a certain multiple of the money invested before the older inferior classes of shares receive anything vcs like to do this at least in the uk look at any other tricks they can legally pull even if the founders are n't inclined to be tricky they may eventually be forced to consider pulling them by a future new investor and when i say look i mean get your lawyer to look if your shareholding survives until exit then it will pay out at exit but repeated and investors with priority classes of shares could mean that your holding does n't survive to exit even if the company does your 5 could turn into a nominal holding that has n't really survived that entitles you to 0.5 of any sale value over $ 100 million then if the company sells for $ 50 million you get $ 0 while other investors are getting a good return all of this is why you should not work for equity unless you can afford to work for free and even then you need to lawyer up now and during any future investment so your lawyer can explain

you want to take the hit now    there are tons of calculators out there but the rule of 70 should be enough to help convince you assume you can put an extra $ 10k in a 401k now or keep it   if you pay ~30 in taxes you   can have either a $ 7k now or b what $ 10 k will grow to in your 40 years till retirement less taxes at the end the rule of 70 is a quick dirty way to calculate compounded returns   it says that if you divide 70 by your assumed return you get the approximate number of years it will take to double your money    so let 's say you assume a 5 rate of return you can replace that with whatever you want 1 is 14 so you 'll double your $ 10k every 14 years 2 in 40 years you 'll double your money almost 3 times 3 that means you 'll end up with almost $ 80k before taxes 4 even if we assume the same tax rate at retirement of 30 odds are decent it 's lower since you 'll have less income presumably you still have $ 56k whatever you think inflation will be $ 56k later is a lot better than $ 7k now

money you need in the next year should not be invested it should be in a cash equivalent account such as a savings or money market account you might be able to construct a cd ladder but it probably wo n't be worth the effort if per the comments you do n't mind returning back to work sooner than a year then you could invest the money you could for instance invest in stocks bonds and mutual funds which are generally quite liquid and can be sold at a moment 's notice they could drop quite dramatically with little notice but still should be quickly salable however you should definitely still keep enough in liquid savings to cover the period before you started working again this includes the time to find a new job start and receive your first paycheck but it also includes whatever time would be needed to yourself from your current activity e.g. if you are traveling enough time to conclude your travels and get back to your home country you would have to regularly sell a portion of your investments in advance so that your liquid savings account always contains at least the minimum amount above

as you point out the main benefits of a pension retirement account over a traditional cash taxable account are the legal and tax benefits   most western countries establish a specific legal definition for an account which is often taxed less or not at all relative to taxable accounts and which contains some protection for the owner in case of a bankruptcy   the typical drawbacks for investing within such structures are limited investment choice limited withdrawal rights either in terms of age or rate of withdrawal and maximum contributions   the benefits are usually very clear and your decision whether or not to open a pension retirement account should depend on a careful weighing of the benefits and drawbacks as to whether you may end up with less than you started that depends on what you invest in   as with all of finance you must take more risk to get more return   although the choices inside a pension retirement account may be worded somewhat differently they are usually fundamentally no different than some of the most popular investments available for ordinary taxable accounts

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

yes you can deduct up to your adjusted gross income agi or your contribution limit whichever is lower note that this reduces your taxable income not your taxes   this is self employment income which is included as compensation for ira purposes    you still have to pay self employment taxes social security and medicare though   you pay those before calculating agi   so this wo n't entirely shield your 1099 income from taxes just from income taxes    note that if you have both w-2 and 1099-misc income you do n't get to pick which gets shielded from taxes   it all gets mixed together in the same bucket   there may be additional limitations if you are covered by a retirement plan at work

from your explanation the sole trader option is more appropriate and certainly easier to manage   there are many differences but the pertinent and most important ones are as follows the main difference in your case would be tax and administration   as a sole trader you would need to do a tax return once a year and if you earned less than £ you would n't have to pay any uk tax assuming you have no other income and are a standard tax payer   the current tax allowance is £ although this can change submitting your own tax return is relatively although you may want to consult an accountant   it is generally easier to run as sole trader versus a limited company ie less paperwork and if you go down the limited company route the company would be liable to pay corporation tax on any profits and this process is more complicated and you would probably need an accountant to do that for you which is likely to cost a few hundred pounds every year   you can do it yourself but the process is not as simple as doing your own income tax return also as a sole trader you can do what you like with any income you can spend it and treat it as your own wages   you ca n't do that if you set up a limited company as the income is owned by the company and so you would need to in effect pay yourself a wage from the company   in other words it 's more complex than if you are a sole trader the main advantage to a limited company is that it is easier to sell the business if you want to at a later date   there is nothing stopping you setting up a limited company later on after a sole trader if you want to   they can also be more tax efficient but this would not be relevant to your case if you are earning relatively small sums if your income increases then you may want to reconsider you can see more information here   i have been both a sole trader and also set up my own limited company

the concept of emergency fund is a matter of opinion i can tell you the consensus is that one should have 6 9 months worth of expenses kept as liquid cash this is meant to cover literally all bills that you might encounter during that time   that 's a lot of money there are levels of savings that are shy of this but still responsible not enough to cover too much in case of job loss but enough to cover the busted transmission the broken water heater etc this is still more than many people have saved up but it 's a worthy goal   the doctor visit is probably the lowest level even without insurance the clinic visit should be under $ 200 and this should n't cause you to have to carry that amount beyond the time the bill comes in   the point that should n't be ignored is that if you owe money at 18 on a credit card the emergency fund is costing you money and is a bit misguided i 'd send every cent i could to the highest rate card and not have more than a few hundred $ $ liquid until the cards were at zero   last $ 5 k $ 10 k in the emergency account is great unless you are foregoing matched 401(k dollars to do it all just my opinion others here whom i respect might disagree with parts of my answer and they 'd be right    edit regarding the consensus 6 9 months i suggest   from investopedia using the conservative recommendation to sock away eight    worth of living expenses the article strongly support my range for the fact that it both cites consensus yet disagrees with it   from money under 30 the more difficult you rank your ability to find a new job the more    we suggest you save up to a year ’s worth of expenses if you think    your income would be very difficult to replace from bank of america    i have no issue with those comfortable with less a dual income couple who is saving 30 of their income may very well survive one person losing a job with no need to tap savings and any emergency expense can come from next month 's income that couple may just need this month 's bills in their checking account

generally a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per share dividends paid by the company plus a fraction of the company 's assets net value in the event of liquidation   if one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts as time goes by the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid it will cease to contribute to the stock 's value because people are not they generally do n't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make   a sane price for a stock however may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments   if unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward the price of the stock should increase   if events cause estimates to be revised downward the price should fall in a sane marketplace if the price of a stock is below people 's estimates of its payouts current cash value people should buy the stock and push the price upward   if it is above people 's estimates they should sell the stock and push the price downward   note that in a sane marketplace rising prices are a red flag indicator for people to stop buying   unfortunately sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead   when that happens prices may soar through the roof but it 's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts   if that value is $ 10/share someone who buys a share for $ 50 basically gives the seller $ 40 that he was not entitled to and which the buyer will never get back   the buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him $ 60 for the share but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one $ 50 that he was n't entitled to either   if the price falls back to $ 10 calling that fall a market correction would n't be a but rather state a fact the share was worth $ 10 before people sold it for crazy prices and still worth $ 10 afterward   it was the market price that was in error the important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in   it 's not necessary to look only at present price earnings ratios since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year   what 's important however is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost

to summarize the money never existed the best example i can give is the housing bubble houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money when people could n't make their payments the house prices crashed   the boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended boom and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes bust   the real question that people should be asking is not where did all the money go but why is money issued by private banks   money is a social invention to facilitate trade should it not be like a public water utility counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized all natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters degrees etc money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest we essentially pay rent on all money that and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created once again at interest this is why economists generally say some inflation is good finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality money is just an iou that requires no such interest payment for it 's issue   interest should be made if a loan is issued against savings but not for the simple issuance of money there should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment you can read more about this from reading about arthur in this way the public controls the value of it 's money not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class   if you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt read the work of it 's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least wealth is subject to the laws of while debt is an invention of the human will debt never rots or with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest nothing in the natural world does this

rebalancing a portfolio helps you reduce risk sell high and buy low i 'll use international stocks and large cap us stocks   they both have ups and downs and they do n't always track with each other international might be up while large cap us stocks are down and vice versa if you started with 50 international and 50 large cap stocks and 1 year later you have 75 international and 25 large cap stocks that means that international stocks are doing relatively well to large cap stocks     comparing only those two categories large cap stocks are on sale relative to international stocks    now move so you have 50 in each category and you 've realized some of the gains from your international investment sell high and added to your large cap stocks buy low the reason to rebalance is to lower risk    you are spreading your investments across multiple categories to manage risk    if you do n't rebalance you could end up with 95 in one category and 5 in another which means 95 of your portfolio is tied to the performance of a single asset category i try to rebalance every 12 months and usually get it done by every 18 months   i like being a hands off long term investor and this has proven often enough to beat the s&p500

gt;there was a good quote in the article about how google apple and amazon combined employ fewer than 1/3 the people that gm did in 1980   yeah that was from the blogs steve   first that is only a total of their direct employees numbers from wikipedia on each company   amazon = apple = facebook = 3,000 google =   so that is not including indirect employees including any and all subcontractors to wit   amazon sells lots of stuff but lets just think of the books alone there are lots of authors publishers printing industry people etc who are not direct employees of amazon nor even indirect contract   employees but whom amazon 's business model has helped to increase total sales of their products and then of course there are all of the amazon affiliates   apple sells stuff but basically no longer manufactures anything at all so comparing it to gm would only be valid if one looked only at gm 's engineering and sales personnel and ignored it 's manufacturing people or if gm had likewise all of its manufacturing to say toyota just about everything that apple sells is made by subcontract overseas manufacturers like foxconn which employed over 900,000 people in china in 2010 and of course that is not including the component manufacturers   and of course this is also ignoring the entire software industry that has built up around apple 's products mac and developers   facebook amp google likewise there are a lot of indirect non employees who nonetheless are in many senses laboring for these companies and be compensated by them whether app developers affiliates etc   i find it very notable that entirely ignored firms like microsoft + direct employees and dozens amp even hundreds of others software companies like adobe systems 9,000 + etc not to mention countless thousands of consulting companies   at it 's absolute peak employment in 1970 gm had a little under 400,000 employees   if you add in microsoft adobe and a handful of cad software companies then high tech employs at least that number add in the domestic sub contract employees the consultants affiliates and on and they employ far more people even domestically than not only gm but gm + ford + chrysler combined   add in the worldwide employment and there is no comparison at   and even then all of it is beside the point   yes you can not eat software or an ipod but likewise you can not eat a car   what is chiefly critical is whether a nation can feed itself and the us production of has never been higher nor on a long term comparison basis have food or energy costs ever been lower even with all of the disastrous effects of monetary inflation   the us 's current problem is is domestic employment and that is mainly a result of various trade monetary and taxation policies it certainly is n't the direct fault of private industry and definitely not the fault of technology   i mean good god how many times does the luddite meme need to be proven false

for smaller trades i 'm not sure you can beat a large dedicated fx trading shop with extremely tight spreads and a micro account that you can open for as little as $ their main offering has a minimum account size of $ 2k us but recommends an account   size of $ 10k or more but they also have a micro account which can be opened for as little as $ 25 with a $ 500 or higher recommended size i have n't used them personally but they 're well known in the discount fx space    one strong positive indicator in my opinion is that they sell an online fx training course for $ 19.99   why is that positive   it means that their margins on your activity are small and they 're not trying to get you hooked   if that were not the case they 'd give the course away since they 'd be able to afford to and they would expect to make so much of your subsequent activity    they do have some free online materials too but not the video stuff another plus is that they encourage you to use less leverage than they allow   this does potentially serve their interests by getting more of your deposits with them but a lot of fx shops advertise the leverage to appeal to users hope to make more faster which is n't a great sign in my opinion note that the micro account has no human support you can only get support via email on the other hand the cost to test them out is close to nil you can literally open an account for $ 25

you can infer some of the answers to your questions from the bats exchange 's market data page and its associated help page   i 'm pretty sure a page like this exists on each stock exchange 's website bats just happens to be the one i 'm used to looking at the matched volume section refers to all trades on a given date that took place on lit exchanges that is where a public protected us stock exchange 's matching engine helped a buyer and a seller find each other   because there are exactly 11 such exchanges in existence it 's easy to show 100 of the matched volume broken down into 11 rows the finra volume section refers to all trades on a given date that took place on non lit exchanges   these types of trades include dark pool volume and any other trade that is not required to take place in public but is required to be reported the r in to finra   there are three venues via which these trades may be reported to finra nasdaq 's nyse 's and finra 's own   they 're all operated under the of finra so the fact that they 're located at nasdaq or nyse is a red herring   for example from the volume data it 's clear that the nasdaq facility does not only handle nasdaq listed tape c securities nor does the nyse facility only handle nyse listed tape a securities or anything like that the number of institutions reporting to each of the is large many more than the 11 public exchanges so the data is not broken down further   also i think the whole point of the is to report in secret   i do n't know enough details to say why the has always handled more reporting volume than the other two facilities   of course since we ca n't see inside the reporting anyway it 's sort of a moot point

sort of yes sort of no all teslas actually claim to be completely out of charge while there is actually still a bit of juice in the battery they do this because fully draining the battery damages it and its life span significantly but that 's just a few percent of full battery capacity and not what 's being discussed in this article   the thing being discussed in this article is that tesla used to sell one specific model that had about 15 of it 's normal battery capacity artificially locked away you could pay tesla a bit extra at any time and they would unlock the full potential of the battery via a remote software update that particular model sold pretty poorly unclear if it 's because customers did n't like the artificial restriction or if the range on that model was simply too short but either way tesla stopped selling it not long after introducing it

i 'm pretty sure you already know this so i 'm probably just wasting time you know i ca n't think of a better analogy to the whole global warming debate than this 97 number a misleading statistic that means nothing is used to mislead the public the origin of this number was a survey of over 10,000 earth scientists in climate related fields a few years back first it was a non scientific survey and only 3000 people bothered to respond the two questions were   the first when compared with levels do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen fallen or remained relatively constant few would be expected to dispute this the planet began out of the little ice age in the middle 19th century the industrial revolution that was the period since the last real ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago 97 of skeptics would answer yes to this   the 2nd do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures so what constitutes significant does changing include both cooling and warming and for both better and worse and which contributions does this include land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation once again many skeptics would answer yes   surprisingly of the 3000 respondents only 82 answered yes to both questions so there is your real consensus well this was n't acceptable of course so they through the 3000 and found 79 that they classified as climate scientists 76 of 79 responded yes to the first question what the heck we have real published scientists who do n't even think the earth has warmed so then 2 of the 3 who answered no to the first question did n't answer the second question i think it is fair to say that if they think there was no warming then they did n't feel that mankind had contributed but for the survey they just reported 75 of 77 97 plus responded yes to the 2nd question so even using their own picking of a subset of 3000 that got the answer they wanted they still cheated and reported the 97 statistic since the honest 95 answer did n't sound good enough to them now that 's the true origin of the statistic and you could probably get 90 of skeptics to agree to the two questions   and none of the questions address the real thing being debated what is the real feedback going to be from co2 warming you ca n't even get a consensus on whether it will be positive or negative

it is possible but unlikely securities firms would prefer never to settle externally rather they prefer to wait until the liabilities can be netted   they are forced to make and take payment in three business days the reason why is because settlement is costly in the same way as any other business would prefer to build trade credit instead of taking or making payment rapidly the only circumstance where a financial firm would wish to take full delivery is when a counterparty is no longer trusted to be solvent

the last column in the source data is volume the number of stocks that was exchanged during the day and it also has a value of zero for that day meaning that nobody bought or sold the stocks on that day and since the prices are prices of transactions the first and the last one on a particular day and the ones with the highest lowest price the prices can not be established and are irrelevant as there was not a single transaction on that day only the close price is assumed equal to its previous day counterpart because this is the most important value serving as a basis to determine the daily price change and we assume no change in this case continuous line charts also use this single value bar and candle charts usually display a blank space for a day where no trade occurred

essentially your question is lump sum vs dca and your tags reflect that in the long run lump sum say a jan 2 deposit each year will beat dca by about 1/2 the average annual market return $ 12,000 will see a 10 return vs $ 1,000/month over the year seeing 6 what hurts is when the market tanks in the first half of the year and you think dca would have helped this is a feeling issue not a math problem   but by the time you have $ 100 k invested the difference of dca vs lump sum with new money fades as new deposits are small compared to the funds invested   by then you need to know your target allocation and deposit to keep that allocation with new money

  gt this strategy is not for everyone borrowing against your home is psychologically difficult and if the investments do n't yield expected returns this strategy could yield negative results by re borrowing the equity in your home you are also removing your cushion of safety if the real estate or investment markets take a turn for the worse by creating an income producing portfolio in an unregistered account there can also be additional tax consequences so always consult with a professional financial advisor to determine whether this strategy is for you and if it is have it tailor made to you and your family 's personal financial situation

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

a quitclaim deed says in essence whatever ownership i have in this property i give to you contrast that with a warranty deed in which the grantor guarantees that he has good title that he has the right to convey the property that it is free of all liens and and that he will warrant and defend your title in the event of a breach obviously the warranty deed gives you more protection to the extent that the grantor has the wherewithal to back it up regardless the trend today is to buy title insurance and let the title company deal with those complications

in the strictest sense of the words freehold and leasehold mean what you think they do freehold is that you own it outright and leasehold is a rental situation that being said there are scenarios like what peter k. mentioned in his comment where you 're purchasing the building and business outright but the land it sits on is actually being leased from a separate land owner   you may also be seeing the business itself being offered as freehold or leasehold in this case you may be purchasing the business of the pub from a pub company but the building the pub resides in is leased from a property owner the pub would be the business plan decor alcohol partnerships etc but not the physical structure in which it resides   you should really look into hiring an estate agent to help you find what you 're looking for they will be able to assist in narrowing down your list and may know of opportunities you 're not seeing in ads

one wonders where the author thinks the monies for the generous boomer pension payouts will come from   and of course they utterly ignore the fact that things like 401k 's and ira 's require that a person begin at a progressive rate after one hits age 70 1/2   yes post retirement fund sales minus the taxes on the proceeds of course which taxes are not to be ignored these people could turn the entire remainder of those monies back around and then re invest them back into the stock market as non tax deferred retail stock purchasers but that is pretty unlikely to happen   in addition the boomers as a generation have become accustomed to a far higher lifestyle newer cars larger amp fancier homes more vacations etc than the previous and so just as with many other things where boomers broke the mold relying the the data from those generations as an economic model of how much wealth retirees tend to cash in and how they spend versus what they sit on and hoard for their heirs may be rather foolish somewhat akin to building an economic model on 20 years of data that americans do n't default on their mortgages yeah that turned out to not be very wise   and then finally i wonder if this author really the meaning of the phrase at the margin after all everyone in a neighborhood does n't have to default on their mortgage to drive house prices down in fact all it takes is a lack of buyers and prices can not be sustained   so the problem with the boomer en masse retirement is not just the possibility that they will all sell everything at the same time but rather that the demographic bulge will at a certain tipping point change from buyer hoarders to sellers and that inevitably will have a major affect on the float and thus the prices of stocks and just as inevitably at some stage of that change herd behavior even panicked herd behavior will take over   it really does n't take much to drive a stock down nor even an entire stock market if the authors wisdom were true would we ever have had any stock market crashes in the first place

i do n't think it makes sense to allow accounting numbers that you are not sure how to interpret as being a sell sign   if you know why the numbers are weird and you feel that the reason for it ill about the future and if you think there 's a reason this has not been accounted for by the market then you might think about selling   the stock 's performance will depend on what happens in the future financials just document the past and are subject to all kinds of seasonality and manipulation you might benefit from posting a link to where you got your financials   whenever one computes something like a dividend payout ratio one must select a time period over which to measure   if the company had a rough quarter in terms of earnings but chose not to reduce dividends because they do n't expect the future to be rough that would explain a crazy high dividend ratio   or if they were changing their capital structure   or one of many other potentially benign things    accounting numbers summarize a ton of complex workings of the company and many ratios we look at could be defined in several different ways   i 'm afraid that the answer to your question about how to interpret things is in the details and we are not looking at the same details you are

many of my friends turn to me for financial advice and here 's what i always tell them because it 's super effective for me 1 i opened an online bank account with scottrade for which i did not request a card or checks i set up direct deposit straight to that account it would be a complicated pain to take money out of that savings the only time i did so was to buy my house which was the purpose of the savings and it involved a wire transfer and printing of the form to fill out and it in etc i have continued to use the account to save for my second house i basically completely forget that the account is even there or that i am missing a large chunk of my money 2 it is very important to actually budget for spending money to continue to spend on impulse items basically allow yourself to spend money on yourself but in a controlled way decide a specific amount that you want to put in a separate account that is just for you to spend to your hearts content and have it direct deposit i find and dave ramsey also encourages this that when i know how much money i am going to blow i feel much more in control and it causes me to not get carried away and blow more than i realized take this a step further decide specifically what you want to buy for yourself and label the account accordingly for example i decided back in march that i wanted to buy an xbox one for when star wars comes out this november i calculated exactly how much money i would need at that time figured how many paychecks i would receive until then and did the math to determine exactly how much i need to direct deposit into an account just for saving to buy the xbox and game i use and i can actually rename the account as it is displayed so i called it xbox fund seeing that title a reminder of what i really want encourages me to not touch it what is your goal behind wanting to save money better what are you saving for label your account accordingly so you do n't just see it as money but as progress

coming from someone who has worked a in the account servicing department of an actual bank in the us other answers are right this is probably a scam the phone number on the letter is probably ringing to a fraudulent call center these are very well managed and sound professional and you must independently locate and dial the true contact number to us bank now tell them what happened reporting is critical securing your money is critical every piece of information you provided the bank when you called needs to be changed or worked around account numbers passwords usernames card numbers get changed tax id numbers get de prioritized as an authentication mechanism even if the government wo n't change them the true bank probably wo n't transfer you to the branch if the front line call center says they will ask the person on the phone what the branch can do that they can not information is your friend they will probably transfer you to a special department that handles these reports apparently union bank 's call center transfers you to the branch then has the branch make this transfer maybe their front line call center team is empowered to handle it like i was either way plug your phone in if the call takes less than 5 minutes they did n't actually do everything 5 to 8 minutes per department is more likely plus hold time there 's a lot of forms they 're filling out what if that office is closed because of time differences go online and ask for an atm limit increase start doing cash advances at local banks if your card allows it just get that money out of that account before it 's in a fraudsters account keep receipts even if the machine declines the transaction either way get cash on hand while you wait for a new debit card and checks for the new account you 're going to open what if this was fraud you draw your us bank account down to zero $ 800 at a time and you do n't close it or change passwords is it over no then your account will get closed and you will owe everything that the fraudsters rack up these charges can put your account far in the negative from this point forward this is called participation in a scam in your depository agreement because you fell victim to it did n't report and the info used was voluntarily given you will also lose any of your money that they spend what if us bank really is closing your account then they owe you every penny you had in it minus any fees allowed in the depository agreement this closure can happen several days after the date on the warning so being able to withdraw does n't mean you 're safe banks usually ship an official check shipped to the last known address they had for you why would a bank within the united states close my account when it 's not below the minimum balance probably because your non resident alien registration from when you were in school has expired and federal law prohibits them from doing business with you now these need renewed at least every three years renewing federally is not enough the bank must be aware of the updated expiration date how do i find out why my account is being closed you ask the real us bank they might find that it 's not being closed good news follow the scam reporting procedure open a new account with us bank if you want or elsewhere and close the old one if it is being closed by the bank they 'll tell you why and they 'll tell you what your next options are ask what can be done other commenters are right that bitcoin activity may have flagged it that activity might actually be against your depository agreement or it set off a detection system or many other reasons the bank who services your account is the only place that knows for sure if i offer them $ 500 per year will they likely keep the account opened otherwise i got to go to singapore open another account legitimate financial institutions in the united states do n't work this way if there is a legal problem with your tax status in the us money to the bank wo n't solve it let 's call the folks you 've talked to and the real because until confirms we have no reason to believe that the letter is real   will ask for money do n't give it do n't give them any further information gather up as much information from them as possible instead where to send it for example then report that to wo n't have a way to charge $ 500/year to you only if they offer a type of account to everyone that costs $ 500 ask for the truth in savings act disclosures banks are legally required to provide these upon request then read them do n't put or keep your money anywhere you do n't understand

one important issue that has yet to be covered is the cost to you in terms of paperwork lost time and phone calls that you have to make to claim the insurance   such insurance claims often are very low priority on their customer service queues for obvious reasons since they have already made the sale therefore you might have to spend up to a few hours of your time calling or writing emails to claim the warranty which may often not be much   therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account    therefore many people end up not claiming the warranty during the hassle much like non scam mail in rebates more often than not you would either forget to or decide it is not worth your time to claim the warranty before buying such policies other than the obvious cost benefit calculations you should also take this additional factor into account

i contend that there is great value in over paying during the year and reaping a bigger refund   i 'm an engineer and understand the concept interest earned blah blah but for most of us this is n't reality the reality is that we spend what we earn plus a little more   at the end of each month if the typical american has money left over we spend it we do n't faithfully put that money that we would have payed into taxes to good use such as savings or paying off that credit card   getting that big refund at the end of the year tends encourage us to make that one time large payment to that high interest account or to purchase that item that we otherwise would n't have saved for or purchased with a credit card   i say give uncle sam the free interest you 'll have wasted that money during the year anyway and enjoy a nice healthy refund that you can put to use for something you enjoy   life is just too short   edit for the nose that ca n't think beyond the possibility of a different perspective post

ultimately you are as stuck as all other investors with low returns which get taxed however there are a few possible you can put up to 15k p.a into a normal isa either cash or stocks shares or a combination if your target is to generate the over 5 years you should maximise the amount you put in an isa then when you come to buy you cash in that part needed to top up your other savings for a deposit i.e. keep the rest in for long term savings the help to buy isa might be helpful but yes there is a limit on the purchase price which in london will restrict you several banks are offering good interest on limited sums in current accounts santander is probably the best you can get 3 taxed on up to 20 k this is a good safe return just open a 123 account arrange to pay out a couple of dds and pay in £ 500 a month you can take the £ 500 straight out again i think lloyds and tsb also offer similar but on much smaller be warned this strategy taken to the limit will involve some complexity checking your various accounts each month after that you will end up trading better returns for greater risk by using more volatile stock market investments rather than cash deposits

debt is nominal which means when inflation happens the value of the money owed goes down   this is great for the borrower and bad for the lender investing can mean a lot of different things   frequently it is used to describe buying common stock which is an ownership claim on a company   a company is not a nominally fixed asset by which i mean if there was a bunch of inflation and nothing else happened i.e. the inflation was not the cause or result of some other economic change then the nominal value of the company will go up along with the prices of other things based on the above i 'd say you are incorrect to treat debt and investment returns the same way with respect to inflation   when we say equity returns 9 we mean it returns a real 7 plus 2 inflation or whatever   if the rate of inflation increased to 10 and nothing else happened in the economy the same equity would be expected to return 17   in fact the company 's nominally fixed debts would be worth less increasing the real value of the company at the expense of their debt holders on the other hand if we entered a period of high inflation your debt liability would go way down and you would have benefited greatly from borrowing and investing at the same time    if you are expecting inflation in the abstract sense then borrowing and investing in common stock is a great idea inflation is frequently the result or cause of a period of economic trouble so please be aware that the above makes sense if we treat inflation as the only thing that changed   if inflation came about because opec makes oil crazy expensive millennials just stop working all of our factories got bombed to or trade wars have shut down international commerce then the value of stocks would most definitely be affected   in that case it 's not really inflation that affected the stock returns though

great question there are several reasons i 'm going to list the few that i can think of off the top of my head right now first even if institutional bank holdings in such a term account are covered by deposit insurance this as well as the amount covered varies geographically the amount covered is generally trivial when seen in the context of bank holdings an individual might have on the order of $ 1,000 $ 10,000 in such an account for a bank that 's basically chump change and you are looking more at numbers in the millions of dollars range sometimes a lot more than that for a large bank even hundreds of millions of dollars might be a relatively small portion of their holdings the 2011 goldman sachs annual report i just pulled a big bank out of thin air here no affiliation with them that i know of states that as of december 2011 their excess liquidity was million us dollars over 170 billion dollars with a bottom line total assets of $ million a shade under a trillion dollars book value good luck finding a bank that will pay you 4 interest on even a fraction of such an amount gs income before tax in 2011 was a shade under 6.2 billion dollars 4 on 170 billion dollars is 6.8 billion dollars that is the interest payments at such a rate on their excess liquidity alone would have cost more than they themselves made in the entire year which is completely unsustainable government bonds are as guaranteed as deposit insurance covered bank accounts it 'll be the government that steps in and pays the guaranteed amount quite possibly issuing bonds to cover the cost but assuming the country does not default on its debt which happens from time to time you will get back the entire amount plus interest for a deposit insured bank account of any kind you are only guaranteed to the extent that one can guarantee anything the maximum amount in the country 's bank deposit insurance i believe in most countries this is at best on the order of $ 100,000 if the bank where the money is kept goes bankrupt for holdings on the order of what banks deal with you would be extremely lucky to recover even a few percent of the principal government bonds are also generally accepted as collateral for the bank 's own loans which can make a difference when you need to raise more money in short order because a large customer decided to withdraw a big pile of cash from their account maybe to buy stocks or bonds themselves government bonds are generally liquid that is they are n't just issued by the government held to maturity while paying interest and then returned electronically these days in return for their face value in cash government bonds are bought and sold on the secondary market as well where they are traded in very much the same way as public company stocks if banks started simply depositing money with each other all else aside then what would happen keep in mind that the interest rate is basically the price of money supply and demand would dictate that if you get a huge inflow of capital you can lower the interest rate paid on that capital banks do n't pay high interest and certainly would n't do so to each other because of their good will they pay high interest because they can not secure capital funding at lower rates this is a large reason why the large banks will generally pay much lower interest rates than smaller niche banks the larger banks are seen as more reliable in the bond market so are able to get funding more cheaply by issuing bonds individuals will often buy bonds for the perceived safety depending on how much money you are dealing with sold a large house recently it is quite possible even for individuals to hit the ceiling on deposit insurance and for any of a number of reasons they might not feel comfortable putting the money in the stock market buying government bonds then becomes a relatively attractive option you get a slightly lower return than you might be able to get in a high interest savings account but you are virtually guaranteed return of the entire principal if the bond is held to maturity on the other hand it might not be the case that you will get the entire principal back if the bank paying the high interest gets into financial trouble or even bankruptcy some people have personal or systemic objections toward banks limiting their willingness to deposit large amounts of money with them and of course in some cases such as for example retirement savings it might not even be possible to simply stash the money in a savings account in which case bonds of some kind is your only option if you want a purely interest bearing investment

gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting while it does have some simple budgeting features they 're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the expense categories accounts and seeing how close one is to a limit that 's been set because the point of gnucash is accounting there 's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously you can split a transaction across multiple categories to have a grocery store purchase of $ 150 be split across $ 100 food and $ 50 phone minutes or whatever but not have a $ 150 purchase be tracked as $ 150 food and $ 150 household expenses because that 's not how double entry accounting works the closest way to do what i think you 're looking for is to take advantage of the account structure and repeat as needed for example this would allow you to see household expenses vs. vacation expenses and still see what it got spent on reporting on all food purchases if you want to do so is slightly more tricky as you 'd need to select all those food categories separately in your report but it 's possible you speak about wanting to track expenses multiple ways so i think that this would allow you to record data sufficient to track it but the point of tracking any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion so if you have more specific reporting requirements you might want to ask about that as well

no spdr etfs are not a good fit for a novice investor with a low level of financial literacy   in fact there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner not even a savings account   an absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account leading to fees and collections i would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works   a savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research   even after 0 hours of research however a savings account is still better than a sock drawer money market accounts through a bank certificates of deposit through a bank and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand   this could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner equities corporate bonds and government bonds are another step up in complexity and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try   equity or bond mutual funds or the etf versions of those which is what you asked about are another level after that also important to understand along the way are the financial institutions and market infrastructure that exist to provide these products   banks credit unions public corporations brokerages stock exchanges bond exchanges mutual fund providers etf providers etc

no i understood your question perfectly   i 'm just saying that sort of situation is generally rare    a quick google search yields this article which responds to the question which funding method should i choose with the answer often you will not have a choice     that is exactly what i 'm saying   the status and stage of your business dictates what sort of financing is even available to you   most often you do n't even have a choice between one or the other   if you want a formula the other people responding mentioned wacc which is the standard that finance professionals typically use   you generally will want a wacc that is similar to other successful companies of your similar size and industry   the actual mechanics of adjusting your wacc will involve either issuing or repurchasing equity or debt   regardless what you are asking is not generally practical nor does it come into practice in 99 out of 100 financing situations   wacc is important to understand and consider but people do n't issue equity or debt just to balance their wacc      think about this another way how easy is it to raise debt   probably fairly easy as usually you can go to commercial banks or go to an investment bank if you 're raising enough debt   companies borrow all of the time they 're constantly paying off loans or taking new ones with different interest rates   there are revolving lines of credit secured loans factoring borrowing against receivables fixed interest debt variable interest debt mezzanine debt etc etc   how easy is it to issue equity   pretty amazingly difficult sure you have your ipos but that happens once in a company 's lifetime   you might have secondary offerings or follow ons but those are incredibly rare i mean you 've probably never even heard of them right   you do n't hear about apple or boeing doing those every quarter do you   you 'll hear about private equity companies buying up firms and you 'll hear about mergers all of the time but again those are once in a lifetime events     so now that you 've read that how often is a company really going to be deciding between debt and equity   not very often

you can move money from a 403b to a 401k plan but the question you should ask yourself is whether it is a wise decision unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employer 's 401k e.g. you can buy your employer 's stock at discounted rates within the 401k and this is a good investment according to your friends neighbors and brothers in law you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an ira where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs e.g. mutual fund fees than in a typical employer 's 401k plan on the other hand 401k assets are better protected than ira assets in case you are sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages the plaintiff can not come after the 401k assets if you can not pay   to answer the question of how you need to talk to the hr people at your current employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a roll over from another tax deferred plan not all plans are agreeable to do this and get any paperwork from them especially making sure that you find out where the check is to be sent and to whom it should be payable then talk to your previous employer 's hr people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money into the 401k plan of your new employer fill out the paperwork make sure they know to whom to cut the check to and where it is to be sent etc in my personal experience i was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new ira account and i had to send it on to the custodian my 403b people refused to send the check directly to the new custodian the following january you will receive a 1099-r form from your 403b plan showing the amount transferred to the new custodian with hopefully the correct code letter indicating that the money was rolled over into another tax deferred account

congratulations   you see the problem   you ca n't get away from unstable currencies the other problem is that the us will shut down anything that appears to be providing a replacement for the us dollar   once a token or medallion or gift certificate or whatever starts being used outside the of one business or one network of businesses it will be shut down quickly   it happened with las vegas gambling tokens   another more recent attempt was with the liberty dollar gold and silver coins and certificates that not only had precious metal backing but whose proponents encouraged taking them to retailers and paying with them as if they were us dollars   there were other problems with this idea but it was the competitive of the liberty dollar that got the headquarters raided and the main site shut down basically all signs point toward dealing with currencies and their state of being systematically eroded over time   if you do find one that appears to exist be wary because the rules can change at any time and the money will be nowhere near as liquid as a proper currency

i do n't think you can compare savings accounts and peer to peer lending the former is a liquid way of stashing some money away iow you can get at it pretty much any time you want whereas the latter is extremely illiquid you only get your money back if and when the loan has been repaid also as mentioned by the other posters there is a risk attached to p2p lending even if the borrowers are vetted by the p2p lending platform you 're essentially taking the same risks that a bank would take when writing a couple of personal loans and that 's quite far removed from a safe haven for your cash if you have enough money to invest not save invest then it might be worth putting a small amount into p2p lending but it 's anything but an alternative to a savings account

after hours trading and alternate venues allow one to trade outside of regular market hours however there are a few reasons why you would not want to the purpose of an exchange is to improve liquidity by gathering all buyers and sellers in the same place at the same time if trading was 24/7 not all market participants would be trading at the same time some markets including nasdaq depend on market makers or specialists to help liquidity these exchanges are able to mandate that the market maker actively make a market in a security during a meaningful percentage of the trading day requiring 24/7 active market making may not be reasonable trading systems meaning both exchange infrastructure and market participant infrastructure need maintenance time it 's nice to have the evenings and weekends for scheduled work post trade clearing and settlement procedures are still somewhat manual at times you need staff around to handle these processes

and the weird shit is that it 's actually kind of good thing for the banks to do that   if there is lot 's of money around on people it means they can invest it on something that investment helps new businesses to emerge and employ more people   if there would be less money around the rich dudes would still invest but there could not be so much competition in investing so they could ask for higher interests    this would mean that the system is rewarding someone more not because he is taking bigger risks or because he is driving the economy into efficient direction but because there just happens to be shortage of money   does more money imply that more people will invest yes because of inflation they have to invest not to lose actually that 's why governments maintain inflation so that people are forced to invest

banks ca n't simply make loans in the void this is how the cash flow works generally   1 add cash into the bank the bank now has cash 10 of that cash is held on reserve per law this cash is held on the balance sheet as an asset cash and a liability demand deposits    2 someone requests a loan the loan is funded from the non reserved cash of these deposits this results in a lessening of an asset cash and the creation of a new asset loan   3 traditionally as the debtor pays back the loan the interest is distributed in some sort of split between the bank and the depositors this means cash in from the loan and interest and a liability deposits also go up   4 alternatively while the above still happens the bank can securitize the loan and sell that to investors investors then get access to the loan and its income and the bank collects a fee however this means more cash on hand for the bank to originate additional loans without going near the reserve requirement    if a bank extends too many loans and its reserve is threatened it must borrow either from the fed or from other banks these loans must be paid back

i would not claim to be a personal expert in rental property i do have friends and family and acquaintances who run rental units for additional income and/or make a full time living at the rental business   as joetaxpayer points out rentals are a cash eating business you need to have enough liquid funds to endure uncertainty with maintenance and vacancy costs often a leveraged rental will show high roi or cagr but that must be balanced by your overall risk and liquidity position i have been told that a good rule of thumb is to buy in cash with a target roi of 10 of course ymmv and might not be realistic for your market it may require you to do some serious bargain hunting which seems reasonable based on the stagnant market you described some examples the main point here is assessing the risk associated with financing real estate the roi or cagr of a financed property looks great but consider the net income a few expensive maintenance events or vacancies will quickly get you to a negative cash flow multiply this by a few rentals and your risk exposure is multiplied too   note that i did not factor in appreciation based on op information cash purchase with some very rough estimates based on op example net income = rent tax = $ per year finance purchase rough estimate with 20 down net income = rent tax = $ 7500 per year

to answer your question as far as what 's available in addition to your 401(k at work most financial types will say to contribute up to the match first you may qualify for a roth ira qualification is based on income if not then you may have to go with a traditional ira   you and your husband can each have one and contribute up to the limit each year   after that you could get just a straight up mutual fund and/or contribute up to limit on your 401(k my two cents this may sound counter intuitive and i 'm sure some folks will disagree but instead of contributing to your 401(k now take whatever that amount is and use it to pay extra on the car loan   also take the extra being paid on the mortgage and pay it on the car loan too   once the car loan is paid off then set aside 15 of your gross income and use that amount to start your retirement investing    any additional money beyond this can then go into the mortgage   once it 's paid off then you can take the extra you were paying plus the mortgage and invest that amount into mutual funds you may want to check out chris 's retire inspired book or podcast as well

since there was no sale where does the money actually come from from the refinancing bank it 's a new loan how does a bank profit from this i.e. why would they willingly help someone lower their mortgage payments because they sell a new loan big banks usually sell the mortgage loans to the institutional investors and only service them so by creating a new loan they create another product they can sell the one they previously sold already brought them profits and they do n't care about it the investors wo n't get the interest they could have gotten had the loan been held the whole term but they spread the investments so that each refi does n't affect them significantly credit unions usually do n't sell their mortgages but they actually do have the interest to help you reduce your payments you 're their shareholder in any case the bank that does n't sell the mortgages can continue making profits because with the money released the paid off loan they can service another borrower

is this legal why not but you might have trouble deducting losses on your taxes especially if you sell to someone related to you in some way which is indeed what you 're doing see the added portion below regarding dealing with related person which a sibling is the state of maryland has a transfer tax of 1.5 for each the buyer and seller would this be computed on the appraised or sale value you should check with the state in california property taxes are assessed based on sale value but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate since you 're selling to family the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to fair market value on the transaction but again check the local law will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing likely banks will be suspicious since you 're giving a discount to your sibling it will likely not cause a problem for financing if it was an unrelated person getting such a discount it would likely to have raised some questions would i be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return as i said it may be a problem if the transaction is between related people likely not otherwise not sure check with a professional tax adviser ea or cpa licensed in maryland you mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling irs publication has a list of what is considered related person and that includes siblings so the short answer is no you will not be able to deduct the loss the tax treatment is not trivial in this case and i suggest to have a professional tax adviser guide you on how to proceed here 's the definition of related person from the irs pub members of a family including only brothers sisters half brothers half sisters spouse ancestors parents grandparents    etc and lineal descendants children grandchildren etc an individual and a corporation if the individual directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the    corporation two corporations that are members of the same controlled group as defined in section of the internal revenue code a trust fiduciary and a corporation if the trust or the grantor of the trust directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the    outstanding stock of the corporation a grantor and fiduciary and the fiduciary and beneficiary of any trust fiduciaries of two different trusts and the fiduciary and beneficiary of two different trusts if the same person is the grantor    of both trusts a tax exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls the organization or a member of    that person 's family a corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than    50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the partnership two s corporations if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation two corporations one of which is an s corporation if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each    corporation an executor and a beneficiary of an estate unless the sale or exchange is in satisfaction of a bequest two partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own more than 50 of the capital interests or profits interests in both    partnerships a person and a partnership if the person directly or indirectly owns more than 50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the    partnership

there are 3 options option 2 may not be available to you when you invest 18,000 in a traditional 401k you do n't pay taxes on the 18k the year you invest but you pay taxes as you withdraw   there 's a required minimum distribution required after age 70   if your income is low enough you wo n't pay taxes on your withdrawals   otherwise you pay as if it is income   however you do n't pay payroll tax social security medicare on the withdrawals   you pay no tax until you withdraw when you invest 18,000 in a roth 401k you pay income tax on the 18,000 in the year it 's invested but you pay nothing after that when you invest 18,000 in a taxable investment account you pay income tax on that 18,000 in the year it 's invested you pay tax on dividends even if they 're re invested and then you pay capital gains tax when you withdraw but remember tax rules and tax rates are only good so long as congress does n't change the applicable laws

whatever you choose for a remedy my first impulse is to suggest bankruptcy you should protect your retirement plans   these are immune from most collection actions the exception being govt debts e.g. taxes and student loans   the sad part is that the student loans wo n't go away except by paying them off   miss one payment and it will you for 10 years   bankruptcy will stop you from getting a home loan for only two years   unless you have the discipline to live like a monk for a decade it sounds like you 're headed for a train wreck   the kids will have to cut back to junior college or some other method of reducing costs and as hard as it sounds do n't cosign for any more student loans kids are more resilient than you think and they 'll probably come up with their own solutions like scholarships work study and off campus jobs   i hate to keep beating the bankruptcy horse but at least that way you could still keep your house and car   otherwise you risk losing either or both from missed payments   i actually hope that you can avoid bankruptcy so i suggest first you talk to a financial adviser or bankruptcy attorney to see if this is in fact right for you but if it 's just the shame of the letter b then consider that pride does n't keep a roof over your head or food in your belly

withdraw in cash bank reports it to irs no matter what would this    affect my tax filing in the coming year no and no the bank does n't report to the irs in the us the bank will probably report to fincen it has nothing to do with your tax return withdraw in check bank does not seem to report it is this correct does n't have to still might if they think it is a suspicious irregular activity wire transfer to another person 's account would this always be    slapped with a gift tax if this is a gift it would regardless of how you transfer the money is it answers to your follow up questions in the us what documents do we need to prepare in case our large sum    withdraw from the bank triggers a flag in relevant government local    and/or federal divisions and they decide to investigate depending on what the investigators request fincen would investigate money laundering the irs would investigate tax evasion the fbi would investigate terrorism sponsorship etc depending on who 's investigating and what the suspicions are different documents may be required but the bottom line is that you should be able to explain the source of the funds and the destination for example i found $ 1 m in cash and sent it to some drug lord because he 's such a good friend of mine will probably not fly does the local federal government care if we stash our money in    cash or check under our mattress if we purchase foreign properties    taxable documents needed for proof or if we give it away to    individuals or organizations individual a gift tax organization    tax the government cares about taxes and illegal activities stashing money under a mattress is not illegal but earning cash and not paying income tax on it usually is in many cases money stashed under the mattress was obtained illegally and/or income taxes were not paid it seems that no matter what we do except spreading thin our assets    to multiple accounts in multiple banks the government will always be    notified of any large bank transaction and we would be forever flagged    since is this correct yes reportable transactions will be reported also spreading around in multiple accounts transactions to avoid reporting is called structuring and is on its own a crime this is for cash cash equivalent transactions only of course not sure about the forever flagged since that part is probably sourced in your imagination

how is the business organized if as a general partnership or llc that reports as a partnership you will be getting distributed to you each year your ownership of the earnings or loss but note this is a paperwork transfer on the form k-1 which must then carryover to your tax return it does not require the transfer of cash to you if organized as an s corp you should be holding shares of the company that you may sell back to the s corp generally as outlined in the original articles of incorporation the annual dividend earnings remaining after all expenses are paid should be distributed to you in proportion to the shares you hold if a c corp and there is only one class of stock that you also hold a percentage of the only profits that must be distributed proportionally to you are declared dividends by the board of directors most family run business are loosely formed with not much attention paid to the details of partnership agreements or articles of incorporation and so do n't handle family ownership disputes very well from my experience trying to find an settlement is the best and least expensive approach to separation from the business but if this ca n't be done or there is a sizable value to the business you may have to get your own legal counsel

dividend yields can also reflect important information about the company 's status for example a company that has never lowered or stopped paying dividends is a strong company because it has the cash earnings power to maintain its dividend regardless of the market ideally a company should pay dividends for at least 10 years for an investor to consider the company as a consistent payer furthermore when a company pays dividend it generally means that it has more cash than it can profitably reinvest in the business so companies that pay dividends tend to be older but more stable an important exception is reit 's and their ilk to avoid taxation these types of funds must distribute 90 of their earnings to their shareholders so they pay very high dividends just look at stocks like or to get an idea the issue here however is two fold so a high dividend can be great if it has been paid consistently or risky if the company is new or has a short payment history and dividends can also tell us about what the company 's status is   lastly taxation on dividend income is higher than taxation on capital gains but by reinvesting dividends you can avoid this tax and lower your potential capital gain amount thus limiting taxes   is an excellent paper on dividend yields and investing

brokerage firms must settle funds promptly but there 's no explicit definition for this in u.s. federal law see for example this article on settling trades in three days wikipedia also has a good write up on t+3 it is common practice however it takes approximately three days for the funds to be available to me in my canadian brokerage account that said the software itself prevents me from using funds which are not available and i 'm rather surprised yours does not you want to be careful not to be labelled a pattern day trader if that is not your intention others can better fill you in on the consequences of this i believe it will not apply to you unless you are using a margin account all but certainly the terms of service that you agreed to with this brokerage will specify the conditions under which they can lock you out of your account and when they can charge interest if they are selling your stock at times you have not authorised via explicit instruction or via a stop loss order you should file a complaint with the and with sufficient documentation you will need to ensure your cancel stop loss order actually went through though and the stock was sold anyway it could simply be that it takes a full business day to cancel such an order

there is a strategy called merger arbitrage where you buy the stock of the acquired company when it sells for less than the final acquisition price usually the price will rise to about the acquisition price fairly rapidly after the merge is announced so you have to move fast the danger is that the merger gets called off regulatory reasons the acquired company board votes no and you get left holding shares bought at a price higher than the price after the merger collapses this is kind of an advanced strategy and a tough one to back test since each deal is unique

you 're right about your suspicions i 'm not a professional i suggest you talk to a real one a one with cpa ea or attorney credentials and license in your state but i would be very cautious in this case the irs will look at all the facts and circumstances to make a claim but my guess would be that the initial claim would be for this to be taxable income for your husband he 'd have to prove it to be otherwise it does seem to be related to his performance and i doubt that had they not known him through his employment they 'd give him such a gift i may be wrong so may be an irs revenue officer but i 'd bet he 'd think the same did they give gifts like that to anyone else if they did was it to other employees or they gave similar gifts to all their friends and family did those who gave your husband a gift file a gift tax return had they paid the gift tax were they principles in the partnership or they were limited partners i.e. not the ones with authority to make any decision was your husband instrumental in making their extraordinary profit or his job was not related to the profits these people made these questions are about the facts and circumstances of the transaction based on what he can find out and other potential information your husband will have to decide whether he can reasonably claim that it was a gift beware unreasonable claims lead to equally unreasonable penalties and charges irs and your state will definitely want to know more about this transaction its not an amount to slide under the radar this is not a matter where you can rely on a free opinions written by amateurs who do n't know the whole story you or rather your husband are highly encouraged to hire a paid professional a cpa ea enrolled agent or tax attorney with enough experience in fighting gift vs income characterization issues against the irs and the state do n't forget your state an experienced professional may be able to identify something in the facts and the circumstances of the situation that would lead to reducing the tax bill or shifting it to the partners but it is not something you do on your own

did n't see it mentioned so far but depending on modified agi you may be prevented from a tax deduction for your contribution to a traditional ira if you or your spouse are offered a retirement plan at work even if you do n't participate in it   see the irs page here for the details of deduction in my opinion because i heavily favor all the benefits of the roth i 'd contribute first to a roth ira and then to the roth 401(k    the former first because it puts the money in a place where you have more control over fees and how it is invested    the latter because the contribution limits are much higher than the ira and the money grows tax free and incurs no taxes on withdrawal

you have to check your contract to be sure what is it you 're paying for typically you get some of the following features which can be unavailable to you in banks which do n't charge a monthly fee arguably these expenses could be paid by the interest rates your money earn to the bank notice how banks which do n't charge a fee usually require you to have a minimum amount of cash in your account or a minimum monthly cash flow when you pay for your bank 's services in cash there 's no such restrictions i 'm not sure if typical banks in the uk would take away your credit card if you lose your job and do n't qualify for that kind of card any more but i do know banks who would the choice is yours and while it 's indeed sad that you do n't have this kind of choice in canada it 's also not like you 're paying solely for the privilege of letting them invest your money behind your back

buy products that can be stored for a long time or require thorough thermal processing for example you can buy frozen chicken meat in two pounds packs it can be stored in a freezer for half a year then you roast it and after it cools down you can put it into a fridge and it will last for up to ten days just about anything that you 've roasted or boiled for several dozens minutes can be stored in a fridge for at least five days its taste will get slightly worse over time but it still preserves nutrition value and is safe to eat

let 's simplify things by assuming you only own 2 stocks by owning voo and vti you 're overweight on and mid cap stocks relative to the market composition likewise by owning vti and vt you 're overweight on u.s. stocks conversely by owning and vt you 're overweight on non u.s. stocks these are all perfectly fine positions to take if that 's what you intend and have justification for for example if you 're in the u.s. it may be a good idea to hold more u.s. stocks than vt because of currency risk but 4 equity index etfs is probably things it is perfectly fine to hold only vti and because these funds comprise thousands of stocks and thus give you sufficient diversification i would recommend holding those 2 etfs based on a domestic international allocation that makes sense to you vanguard recommends 40 of your stock allocation to be international and if for some reason you want to be overweight in and mid cap companies throw in voo you can use morningstar x ray to look at your proposed portfolio and find your optimal mix of geographic and stock style allocation

that is very true   i should have used the qualifier that they basically only do domestic travel   i have never tried to red eye with them but i guess they do n't do it much if at all   however if you have freedom they are awesome due to their policies on   changing tickets no fees just fair difference and you keep the credit until you use it even when you buy the cheap fair   they do n't fuck around with 24 hour cancellation policy if you decide to cancel no question pressure they just refund the money    their rewards program is arguably the best if not one of the business best worst frequent flier programs   they do n't charge to check bags    their boarding process get people on the plane in 15 mins instead of 30 or 45 mins my favorite part of sw after recently flying aa after like 10 sw flight   they are the most on time airline in the on time lifestyle travel tech airlines jet blue    and they give away drink tickets like candy on halloween

gt;every single grocery store is consumerist i 've been shopping at whole foods for almost 30 years and the reason is because whole foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me and then delivering the experience of shopping in a safeway 's or the like is ugly uncomfortable cold and smelly they are too big and take forever to get from one item i want to another they are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious   and they 've tricked you into thinking they are n't   i mean if your biggest problem in life is the appearance of your store fine but underneath all the faux wood and fake ass decor designed to make you think it 's rustic and natural every last trick in the retail book is being used on you   they do sell junk it 's just packed differently    gt;what makes you think whole foods is in any way more deceptive than walmart publix costco etc because they responded to a market that wanted quality food that could be traced back to it 's source why would n't they respond to that    because despite being pretty much the same thing they make a lot of noise about not being the same so they can charge you a premium   i could trace back food in just about any store i go into why should wf get a cookie for this   the packages come with labels and even if they do n't the case that held those items did which means that knowing where your food came from never gets more complicated than asking the staff   to me those things are deceptive because they 're marketing things that everyone does as though it 's a unique selling point   even walmart has farm to table sourcing   it 's in a code on their salads      gt;i'm thrilled that it is that means i can access food that i want and enjoy and it costs less than it would otherwise i can buy sugar free bacon at whole foods yay i feel great about that i ca n't get that at safeway    ever read the label on bacon   there 's not a lot of sugar there to start with    gt;do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets do n't collectively far whole foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce that they do n't sacrifice quality for profits    not really i think whole foods has a whole bunch of millennials into believing the hype that just because they have a farmers market decor that somehow they 're better and more pure than other stores   almost every business in a capitalist economy sacrifices quality for profits   that 's how it works   i do n't like whole foods because they 're tricking gullible people like you into thinking that they give a single shit about you or your health   they do n't they care about the money in your wallet   it 's all commercial food it comes from the same fields

the first and most important thing to consider is that this is a business transaction and needs to be treated as such nail down absolutely all the details specifically including what happens if either of you decides it 's time to move and wants to sell off your share of the property get at least one lawyer involved in drawing up that contract perhaps two so there 's no risk of conflict of interest what 's your recourse or his if the other stops making their share of the payments who 's responsible for repairs and upkeep if you make renovations how does that affect the ownership percentage and what kind of approval do you need from him first and how do you get it and how quickly does he have to respond if he wants to do something to maintain his investment such as how does he negotiate that with you especially if it 's something that requires access to the inside of the house who is the insurance paid by or will each of you be insuring it separately what are the tax implications consider every possible outcome the fact that you 're friends now does n't matter and in fact arguments over money are one of the classic things that kill friendships i 'd be careful making this deal with a relative though in fact i did loan my brother a sizable chunk of change to help him bridge between his old house and new house and that 's registered as a mortgage to formalize it i 'd insist on who owns what even with a spouse since marriages do n't always last with someone who 's just a co worker and casual friend it 's business and only business and needs to be both evaluated and contracted as such to protect both of you if you ca n't make an agreement that you 'd be reasonably comfortable signing with a stranger think long and hard about whether you want to sign it at all i 'll also point out that nobody is completely safe from long term unemployment the odds may be low but people do get blindsided the wave of foreclosures during and after the recent depression is direct evidence of that

first request that you complete a tax return on this tax return you will complete both the employed and self employed sections this will give you a total income and tax liability you will already have paid some tax via paye but you will have to pay additional tax for any other income for future years there is the option depending on amount to collect extra tax through paye to cover the other earnings if it is likely to be the same for the next few years this may be a better option than paying a lump sum the tax return is now mostly online and not too bad if your affairs are otherwise simple the hardest part will be keeping a good record of your other earnings remember that you have to keep these records for seven years in case hmrc ever want to audit them and it 's a good idea to have a separate account for the income or some other way of easily identifying it

dollar cost averaging can be done in a retirement plan and can be done for individual stock purchases as this will increase your returns by reducing your risk especially if you are buying a particular stock for the first time    how many time have i purchased a stock bottom fishing thinking i was buying at the low only to find out there was a new low   sitting with a thousand shares that are now down $   i have a choice to sell at a loss hold what i 've got or double down   i usually add more shares if i 'm thinking i 'll recover but at that time i 'd wished i 'd eased into my investment   that way i would have owned more shares at a smaller cost basis    anything can happen in the market not knowing whether the price will increase or decrease   in the example above a $ 3,000 loss is equal to the brokerage cost of about 300 trades so trading cost should not be a factor   now i 'm not saying to slowly get into the market and miss the bull like we 're having today with trump but get into individual stocks slowly being fully invested in the market    also dca means you do not buy equal number of shares per period say monthly but that you buy with the same amount of money a different number of shares reducing your total costs   let 's say you spend $ 2000 on a stock trading at $ 10 200 shares if the stock rose to $ 20 you would spend $ 2000 and buy 100 shares and if the stock dropped to $ 5 you would spend $ 2000 and buy 400 shares by now having amassed 700 shares for $ 6,000   on the other hand and in contrast to dca had you purchased 200 shares for $ 2000 at $ 10/share then 200 shares for $ 4000 at $ 20/share and finally 200 more shares for $ 1000 at $ 5/share you would have amassed only 600 shares for $ 7000 investment

is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data sure   but this does n't matter   all the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically   but the banks paypal do n't care about the historical value   they want to know the price that they 'll pay when they get around to switching not the last price before the switch   beyond that there is a transaction cost to switching   they have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction    the banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse but that increases their risk   if the bank has a large balance of us dollars but dollars are falling then they end up eating that cost   they 'll only take that risk if they think that they 'll make more money that way   and in the end they may have to go on the currency market anyway   if a european bank runs out of us dollars they have to buy them on the open market   or a us bank might run out of euros   or yen   etc    another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small but the overhead is fixed   if the bank has to pay $ 5 for every currency transaction they wo n't even break even charging 3 on a $ 100 transaction   so they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time   but then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime   if they credit you with $ 97 in your account $ 100 minus the 3 fee but the price actually drops from $ 100 to $ 99 they 're out the $ 1    they could do it the other way as well   you ask for a $ 100 transaction   they perform a $ 1000 transaction of which they give you $ 97   now they have $ $ 1000 minus the $ 5 they paid for the transaction plus the $ 3 they charged you for the transaction   if there 's a 1 drop they 're out $ $ in currency loss plus a net $ 2 in fees    this is why banks have money market accounts   so they have someone to manage these problems working twenty four hours a day   but then they have to pay interest on those accounts further eating into their profits   along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them

you have the 2 properties and even though the value of property b is less than the amount you owe on it hopefully you have some equity in a. so if you do have enough equity in property a why do n't you just go to the one lender and get both property a and b refinanced under the same mortgage this way hopefully the combined equity in both properties would be enough to cover the full amount of the loan and you have the opportunity to refinance at favourable rate and terms sounds like you are in the usa with an interest rate of 3.25 i am in australia and my mortgage rates are currently between 6.3 to 6.6

there is a problem with grouping them all as dismantling as many are and are wasteful   the epa itself can not get out of it 's own way     i worked on one project recently 2 years ago where we were designing a cooling tower huge ac for power plant for goose creek sc where we were going to add another tower so that they could eventually switch to a close loop system keeps all water in system no dumping in river   the city of goose creek went to court because the epa made a rule that by a certain date a company could no longer use an open system on a cooling tower if it dumped into a   the city got their wish and they won and the epa backed off and the town of goose creek gets to keep the dirty warm water that was is being dumped into the river so that the fishermen would have better catches no shit this is how it was and they wanted to keep it they did n't want to chance losing the warm waters that drew more fish   well jokes on the town as we are now building a tower in that location that will have an open system to dump into the river   here 's the catch before it was to be a tower where the water must be better quality as the media in the tower could foul and impact the thermal rating of the tower now they are going with a type tower and the media on those can accept the worst fucking water you can think of and still perform properly   so now the fishermen will get some nasty water that will be just below the allowable amount set by the epa so that some lazy people can catch fish easier   that is what i consider a wasteful government program   but that is just my opinion based on an interaction i had with a project where the epa stuck there big head where they did nt even know what they were doing

a practical issue is that insider trading transfers wealth from most investors to the few insiders if this were permitted non insiders would rarely make any money and they 'd stop investing that would then defeat the purpose of the capital markets which is to attract capital a moral issue is that managers and operators of a company should act in shareholders interests insider trading directly takes money from other shareholders and transfers it to the insider it 's a nasty conflict of interest and would allow any ceo of a public company to make ton of money quickly regardless of their job performance in short shareholders and management should succeed or suffer together so their interests are as aligned as possible and managers have the proper incentives

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

the issue is that the lender used two peoples income debts and credit history to loan both of you money to purchase a house the only way to get a person off the loan is to get a new loan via refinancing the new loan will then be based on the income debt and credit history of one person there is no paperwork you can sign or the ex spouse can sign that will force the original lender to remove somebody from the loan there is one way that a exchange of money between the two of you could work the ex spouse will have to sign paperwork to prove that it is not a loan that you will have to payback i picked the number 20 k for a reason if the amount of the payment is above 14 k they will have to document for the irs that this is a gift and the amount above 14 k will be counted as part of their estate when they die if the amount of the payment is less than 14 k they do n't even have to tell the irs if the ex has or you have the multiple payments can be constructed to exceed the 14 k limit

if you have 100 of your money in one security that is inherently more risky than splitting your money 50/50 between two securities regardless of the purported riskiness of the two securities the calculations people use to justify their particular breed of diversification may carry some assumptions related risk reward calculations   but these particular do n't change the fact that spreading your money across different assets protects your money from value variances of the individual assets   splitting your $ 100 between apple and microsoft stock is probably less valuable less well diversified than splitting your money between apple and whole foods stock but either way you 're carrying less risk than putting all $ 100 in to apple stock regardless of the assumed rates of return for any of these companies stock specifically edit i 'm sure the downvotes are because i did n't make a big deal about correlation and measuring correlation and standard deviations of returns and detailed portfolio theory   measuring efficacy and justifying your particular allocations that generally uses data from the past to project the future is all well and good   fact of the matter is if you have 100 of your money in stock that 's more stock risk than 25 in cash 25 in bonds and 50 in stock would be because now you 're in different asset classes   you can measure to your hearts delight the effects of splitting your money between different specific companies or different industries or different market or different countries or different fund managers or different whatever metrics and doing any of those things will reduce your exposure to those specific allocations    it may be worth pointing out that currently the hot recommendation is a plain vanilla market tracking s&p 500 index fund that just buys some of each of the 500 largest us companies without any consideration given to risk correlation over standard deviation calculating actively managed funds   if you ask me that speaks volumes of the true efficacy of hyper analyzing the purported correlations of various securities

in theory the idea is that diversified assets will perform differently in different circumstances spreading your risk around whether that still functions in practice is a decent question as the truth of most probability based arguments for diversification rely on the different assets being at least somewhat uncorrelated this article suggests that might not be true specifically the correlations we note among industry sectors are profoundly and high and   gold and silver traders have gotten too used to the negative correlation trade with stocks this is in fact an unusual relationship for precious metals the correlation should actually be zero

the calculation is to figure out how many dollars you get in return for the amount of dollars you spend in your case you know you get 1000 points for $ 1000 dollars and can redeem one movie ticket for 1000 points therefore granted that you could also redeem a $ 8 9 ticket making your return 0.8 0.9   in addition this can get more complicated for some points cards that may give out free points and is especially so if there 's an intermediary such as air miles for which points can be earned in numerous ways to get really nitty gritty you could to keep a spreadsheet where you list number of dollars spent number of points gained number of points redeemed and value of reward received thus you can figure out exactly what your cost is for each point second factor from above as well as the ultimate value of each point with respect to rewards redeemed first factor i 'm considering doing that myself since i 'm prone to spreadsheet addiction but this method is likely overkill for most points cards

what you are saying is a very valid concern   after the flash crash many institutions in the us replaced true market orders where tag and has no price with deep in the money limit orders under the hood after the cftc sec joint advisory commission raised concerns about the use of market orders in the case of large hft traders and concerns on the lack of liquidity that caused market orders that found no limit orders to execute on the other side of the trade driving the prices of blue chip stocks into the pennies   we also applaud the cftc requesting comment regarding whether it is    appropriate to restrict large order execution design that results in    disruptive trading in particular we believe there are questions    whether it is ever appropriate to permit large order algorithms that    employ unlimited use of market orders or that permit at    prices which are a dramatic percentage below the present market price    without a pause for human review so although you still see a market order on the front end it is transformed to a very aggressive limit in the back end however doing this change manually by selling at price 0 or buying at may backfire since it may trigger fat finger checks and prevent your order from reaching the market   for example bats exchange   rejects orders that are priced too aggressively and do n't comply with the range of valid prices   if you want your trade to execute right now and you are willing to take slippage in order to get fast execution sending a market order is still the best alternative

this is fine and can definitely be done the bank will be perfectly fine with it since you 're paying interest on the money as long as they 're confident that you can repay the whole growing balance of course there 's the issue of the credit limit which you 'll eventually reach and then you wo n't be able to pull this off any longer problems start when the bank either loses that confidence or the credit line is term limited like heloc for example and comes to term in either case you 'll be required to cover the balance and especially in the first case as a balloon payment if they call on you when you do that you will most likely go bankrupt and the longer you keep doing it the higher are the chances of that happening

$ for every $ 1000 per year are you kidding me these are usually hidden within the expense ratio of the plan funds but > 1 seems to be quite a lot regardless fund x 1 year return 3 3 year return 6 10 year return 5 what does    that exactly mean this is the average annual rate of return if measured for the last 3 years the average annual rate of return is 6 if measured for 1 year it 's 3 what it means is that out of the last 3 years the last year return was not the best the previous two were much better does that mean that if i hold my mutual funds for 10 years i will get    5 return on it definitely not past performance does n't promise anything for the future it is merely a guidance for you a comparison measure between the funds you can assume that if in the past the fund performed certain way then given the same conditions in the future it will perform the same again but it is in no way a promise or a guarantee of anything since my 401 k plan stinks what are my options if i put my money in a    traditional ira then i lose my pre tax benefits right wrong ira is pre tax as well but the pre tax deduction limits for ira are much lower than for 401k   you can consider investing in the 401k and then rolling over to a ira which will allow better investment options after your update just clearing up the question my current employer has a 401k. most of    the funds have the expense ratio of 1.20 there is no matching    contributions ouch should i convert the 401 k of my old company to traditional ira and    start investing in that instead of investing in the new employer 401 k    plan with high fees you should probably consider rolling over the old company 401k to a traditional ira however it is unrelated to the current employer 's 401k if you 're contributing up to the max to the roth ira you ca n't add any additional contributions to traditional ira on top of that the $ 5000 limit is for both and the agi limitations for roth are higher so you 're likely not able to contribute anything at all to the traditional ira you can contribute to the employer 's 401k you have to consider if the rather high expenses are worth the tax deferral for you

first note that cibc issued these bonds with a zero coupon so they do not pay any interest   they were purchased by the market participants at a small premium paying an average of for a nominal value of 100   this equates to a negative annual redemption yield of i.e. if held until maturity then the holder will witness a negative annual return of you ask why does this make sense   clearly it makes no sense for a private individual to purchase these bonds since they will be better off simply holding cash   to understand why there is a demand for these bonds we need to look elsewhere the european bond market is currently suffering a dwindling supply owing to the bond buying programme i.e. quantitative easing   the ecb is purchasing eur 80 billion per month of eurozone sovereign debt   this means that the quantity of high grade bonds available for purchase is shrinking fast against this we have all of those european institutions and financial corporations who are legally obliged to purchase bonds to be held as assets against their obligations   these are mostly national and private pension funds as well as insurance companies and fund managers    in this sort of environment the price of high quality bonds is quickly bid up to the point where we see negative yields in this environment companies like cibc can borrow by issuing bonds with a zero coupon and the market is willing to pay a small premium over their nominal value tl dr the situation is further complicated by the inflation outlook for the eurozone with a very real possibility of deflation   should a prolonged period of deflation then negative redemption yield bonds may provide a positive real return

properties do in fact every year for several reasons one of the reasons is that an old property is not the state of the art and can not therefore compete with the newest properties e.g. energy efficiency may be outdated second reason is that the property becomes older and thus it is more likely that it requires expensive repairs i have read somewhere that the real value depreciation of properties if left practically i.e. only the repairs that have to absolutely be performed are made is about 2 per year but do not remember the source right now however properties or more accurately the tenants do pay you rent and it is possible in some cases that rent more than pays for the possible depreciation in value for example you could ask whether car leasing is a poor business because cars depreciate in value obviously it is not as the leasing payments more than make for the value depreciation however i would not recommend properties as an investment if you have only small sums of money the reasons are so as a summary for large investors property investments may be a good idea because large investors have the ability to diversify however large investors often use debt leverage so it is a very good question why they do n't simply invest in stocks with no debt leverage for small investors property investments do not often make sense if you nevertheless do property investments remember the diversification also in time so purchase different kinds of properties and purchase them in different times putting a million usd to properties at one point of time is very risky because property prices can rise or fall as time goes on

here 's a reality check they likely cost on the order of a few million yr which is small potatoes compared to what taibbi makes it sound like they got caught and are going to jail   since taibbi at every turn and demonstrably so i do not trust his reporting the bid were charged with dozens of bids from 1999 to 2006 know how many bids were performed in that time i challenge you to find out i bet there was more than dozens issued over that 7 year period in fact since there appear to be in new bonds issues a year and the one mentioned in the story was for 300 m if that is representative of the sizes then there are over 1,000 issued a year for 7000 or so over that period they corrupted dozens oh the humanity   feel free to correct any of these numbers as you see fit   reading the actual pdf from the charges one finds that the fraud was no where near as egregious as the taibbi story makes it out to be   cases is the indictment and here is the press release financial bid rigging article reporting on the trial with no where near the that taibbi lives for an article that actually reports facts from the case and makes no press former financial services executives convicted for roles in involving investment contracts for the proceeds of municipal bonds fbi press release not a single one of these sources that actually had something to do with the investigation trial and conviction includes anything near what taibbi writes   in fact other than taibbi 's story and those reporting on it it appears this is not all the big banks in cahoots to defraud poor bond markets but a few bad apples that got caught and are getting appropriate punishment   let me ask you how much money did they take the total market appears to be in new sales some of the charges included something like changing a instrument to a 5 instrument for an item in a 300 million dollar range if they the entire difference which is not likely since there were bid rigging which returns far less the the difference in the rigged bid that comes to 120k yr for one of dozens taibbi himself writes they may have made up to yr on that one massive if all were like that then dozens is approximately 48 yr = 4 million a year the biggest number for stolen money in any of the actual court documents i have seen ranges in the 50 100 k range    please provide better evidence from actual court documents and not taibbi style hearsay until then i provided you a reality check

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

if your financial needs are n't complex and mostly limited to portfolio management consider looking into the thing called robo advisers proper term is automated investing services   the difference is that robo advisers use software to manage portfolios on a large scale generating big economy of scale and therefore offering a much cheaper services than personal advisor would and unless your financial needs are extremely complex the state of the art of scaled up portfolio management is at the point that a human advisor really does n't give you any value add and as other answers noted human advisor can easily bring in downsides such as conflict of interest and lack of fiduciary responsibility   disclaimer i indirectly derive my living from a company which derives a very small part of their income from a robo adviser therefore there 's a possible small conflict of interest in my answer

in your particular condition could buy the condo with cash then get your mortgage on your next house with less than 20 down i.e. with mortgage insurance but it would still be an owner occupied loan   if you hate the mortgage insurance you could save up and refi it when you have 20 available including the initial down payment you made i.e. 80 ltv ratio total   or perhaps during the time you live in the condo you can save up to reach the 20 down for the new house   or perhaps you can just rent somewhere then get into the house for 20 down and while there save up and eventually buy a condo in cash later   or perhaps buy the condo for 50 down non owner occupied mortgage ianal but some things that may come in handy you do n't have to occupy your second residence owner occupied mortgage for 60 days after closing on it   so could purchase it at month 10 i suppose   in terms of locking down mortgage rates you could do that up to 3 months before that even so i 've heard    it 's not immediately clear if rent backs could extend the 60 day intent to occupy or if so by how long 1 month might be ok but 2 dunno also you could just buy one or the other or both of your mortgages as a 20 down conventional non owner occupied mortgage and generate leeway there ex buy the home as non owner occupied and rent it out until your year is up though non owner occupied mortgage have worse interest rates so that 's not as appealing   or buy one as a secondary residency mortgage   consult your loan officer there they like to see like geographic distance between primary and secondary residences i 've heard if it 's hud fha mortgage the owner occupancy agreement you will sign is that you will continue to occupy the property as my primary residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy unless extenuating circumstances arise which are beyond my control ref i.e. you plan on living in it for a year so you 're kind of stuck in your case   maybe you 'd want to occupy it as quickly as possible initially to make the year up more quickly apparently you can also request the lender to agree to arbitrarily rescind the owner occupancy aspect of the mortgage half way through though i 'd imagine you need some sort of excuse to convince them   might not hurt to ask

it is basically the same situation what us was when the crash happened people took on debt without the means to pay even with awful credit records but the problem is n't the debt people take on themselves but with the limited disposable income they have how efficiently can their debts be serviced and how do banks who lend out money can recover their money when banks lend money to all and they have to take care of defaults and that is when financial comes into play in us people have the option to default on their debt and refinance it so banks assumed default and tried to hedge their risks if this is an option in australia be ready for a crash else not to worry about much if banks continue lending expect higher inflation rates higher interest rates and maybe a downgrade of bonds issued by the australian government higher import costs and a boom in exports because of devalued australian dollar

completely agree wal mart has both the capital and the wherewithal to readjust incredibly quickly as they deem it necessary to do so couple those with the clout they have with manufacturers and it 's fairly easy to see that a threat to wal mart such as to see them losing all to amazon is more than a bit overly optimistic on an amazon fanatic 's part   i like amazon and shop there regularly arguably more than wal mart but i shop at both there are certain things that wal mart is just better for for now things change but wal mart can easily afford to change with it if it feels so inclined they are n't ibm vs microsoft stuck in a mindset and incapable of imagining a reality outside of that even with that analogy ibm is still around

tax is often calculated per item   especially in the days of the internet some items are taxable and some are n't depending on the item and your nexus   i would recommend calculating and storing tax with each item to account for these subtle differences edit not sure why this was downvoted if you do n't believe me you can always check with amazon i think they know what they 're talking about final update now if someone goes to your site and buys something from your business in california and the shipping address for the product is nevada then taxes do not have to be collected   if they have a billing address in california and a shipping address in nevada and the goods are shipping to nevada you do not have to declare tax if you have a mixture of tangible computer mouse keyboard and intangible assets warranty in a cart and the shipping address is in california you charge tax on the tangible assets but not on the intangible assets yes you can charge tax on the whole order   yes for most businesses that 's good enough but i 'm not trying to provide the good enough solution i 'm simply telling you how very large businesses run and operate   as i 've mentioned i 've done several tax using software called google if you 've not heard of it and have done those for companies like the bbc and owned and operated by bill gates take it or leave it but the correct way to charge taxes especially given the complex tax laws of the us and internationally is to charge per item   if you just need the good enough approach feel free to calculate it by total some additional reading another possible federal limitation on internet taxation is the united states supreme court case corp. v. north dakota 504 u.s. which held that under the dormant commerce clause goods purchased through mail order can not be subject to a state ’s sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state the tax   in 1997 the federal government decided to limit taxation of internet activity for a period of time the internet tax freedom act prohibits taxes on internet access which is defined as a service that allows users access to content information email or other services offered over the internet and may include access to proprietary content information and other services as part of a package offered to customers the act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods

it is very likely that the fund paid out a dividend in the form of reinvested shares   this happens with many funds especially as we come to the end of the year here 's a simplified example of how it works   assume you invested $ 1000 and bought 100 units at $   ignoring the daily price fluctuations if the fund paid out a 20 dividend you would get $ 200 and the unit price would drop to $   assuming you chose to reinvest your dividends you would automatically purchase another $ 200 worth of units at the new price so 25 more units   you would now have 125 units $ = $ 1000 invested in your example notice that you now have more shares than you originally purchased but that the price dropped significantly   your market value is above what you originally invested so there was probably also a bit of a price increase for the day   you should see the dividend transaction listed somewhere in your account just to confirm i did a quick search on and found that they did indeed pay a dividend yesterday

in the us the bank is legally required to report any cash transactions over 10k$ to the government this normally has no consequences and you will never hear about it no need to worry about it if the amount is very high or you do it repeatedly or the government has other pre existing reasons to look at your finances sharply they might ask you where the money came from and what you did with it but your explanation is perfectly fine assuming it is true the idea is to catch money that try to get large illegal cash incomes into the banking system classic example is the drug lord who makes a million a month in cash from selling drugs and needs to get this million into the banks as you ca n't buy houses or luxury cars or yachts with cash without getting fbi attention right away

because it is a roth ira not traditional you never pay penalties for withdrawing any amount up to your total contributions amount this is because you are funding it with after tax money but it sounds like your roth had $ 11 k in it and you zeroed it out if you were less than 59.5 years old at the time you made the withdrawal then if you did not return anything to the account then you would pay tax on the 6 k as income this year at your normal tax rate plus an additional 10 penalty on that 6 k $ 600 the 5 k in contributions is not taxable now since it 's been more than 60 days since you withdrew the money you can not put the 6 k in earnings back in without paying the penalty however you can still contribute $ 5500 per year or $ 6500 if you 're over 50 so you can put back $ 5500 and then you would only have to pay tax + 10 on the $ 500 difference update i would recommend talking to an accountant the fact that you intended to buy a house might provide a mechanism for getting the money back in if you wish if this was your first house or you have not owned a home in the last 2 years then you would be considered a first time homebuyer and there is a special exception allowing you to remove 10 k without penalty if you end up not purchasing the home you have 120 days to contribute those funds back in treated as a thank you littleadv for the link to this as for the final 1 k overage i believe you can count that towards your $ contribution when you put the entire amount back lastly after digging into this you have hit so many edge cases with your scenario 6 k in earnings being between 5500 for under 50 and 6500 for over 50 it 's been 70 days which is between the 60 day normal cutoff and the 120 day extended cutoff for home purchase falling through and 11 k total being just over the 10 k cutoff for the same that i 'm starting to wonder if this is some sort of contrived case for an accounting exam

i do n't think this is a french thing   it 's like this everywhere   banks always want people to open accounts of every type   a person with a checking account should be easy to sell on a savings account at the same institution given that it does not appear that they will have any chance to recover the money they spend to get customers to open these accounts there are no fees and they have to pay out the interests even if very small oh they recover it   banks make money by having deposits that they can use to lend out   they do pay interest on deposits but not as much as they earn on your money   if they persuade you to have a savings account in addition to your checking account then you might find it convenient and then move your money out of a different institution into their savings account   or you might stop hoarding it under your mattress   or whatever   more money in their accounts means more profit for them i do n't know whether banks make more profit per dollar in savings or checking accounts   i see banks pushing for both   i think they simply view more accounts as a good thing because it can lead to more total savings in their institution   that 's how they make money

this particular topic has probably been beaten to death already   but from the other comments it seems that splitting finances them is a popular solution on this forum   i can see the individual benefit of this makes it easy to go buy whatever you want   but it can hurt too   what if the situation changes and you are no longer employed   your setup will cause stress because now you are having to ask your spouse to pay for everything   if this works for you congratulations   but fights may ensue divorce may follow i would like to offer an alternative   in my situation i bring home a paycheck while my wife does not   in this case each of us paying 50 would simply not work   not to say my wife does n't work she works her butt off cleaning house raising kids etc what we do is have any money that comes in go into a pot   we budget oh no the b word out regular expenses lights gas rent   anything that is n't allocated goes towards retirement savings in the us an ira is an individual retirement account or towards a war chest for big project such as home ownership   and each of us gets the same blow money allowance every week that we can do with as we please keep in mind using this mentality allows the possibility of me staying home at some point in the future when my wife goes back to her dream job   and there is no financial stress about whom owns what or who paid for what   we own it because we decided to pay for it

here 's some way of thinking about it and i 'm not really sure if it 's completely correct but sometimes we oversimplify when trying to tell a five year old   say there are two people in the world you and me we both have $ 100 a total of $ 200 in the world   suddenly a wild bank appears i deposit my $ 100 in the bank i still have $ 100 and you still have $ 100 now you want to buy something from me that costs $ 150 you go to the bank to loan money the bank has $ 100 available so gives you $ 50 you give me $ 150 now i have $ 250 and you are $ 50 in debt i deposit the $ 150 in the bank   we do this again and again until i have $ 1000 on my bank account and you are $ 900 in debt i want to buy a house of $ 500 and go to my bank demanding to take out $ 500 but there is only $ 200 in the whole world so the bank can only give me $ 200   money has been created out of thin air but it 's actually you who are in debt if you go bankrupt the bank has a big debt it wo n't get back and is in deep shit when i come around to demand my money back at that point governments step in to loan the bank money for cheap because if the bank fails i will lose all my pension savings i put into that bank as well as my companies and a lot of my employees   and other banks loaned this bank money so if this bank fails the other banks will be in the exact same position and will also fail because then they will also have debts that wo n't be paid back   there are regulations minimizing this i.e. a bank is required to keep a percentage of the amount of money on its accounts so there 's a maximum limit of money created

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

you are right on track with your idea of setting up a separate account for invoiced income create a new account with the type other asset and call it receivables or something similar every time you invoice a client enter a credit to this account with the amount of the invoice once the client pays and you deposit a check enter a transfer from the receivables account to the bank account edit i overlooked that you wish to account for not yet invoiced income i think that 's a bad idea it will become confusing and will give you the false sense that your financial condition is better than it really is there are plenty of stories about businesses that have stellar sales but fail because of lack of cash flow the business bills become due before it gets paid by its own customers

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

some people would think that the government should mandate that walmart pay their employees more    however that wo n't stop other companies from pushing the cost of business unto taxpayers it seems that walmart is acting perfectly rational as a business would   i think the better solution would be to stop enabling these companies with a backdoor subsidy and stop giving out free money and handouts to people when people realize they wo n't get free money from the government they will demand better wages from companies or wo n't bother to work there   the best solution which runs counter intuitive to the previous solution and the one i 'm leaning towards is it is completely transparent and eliminates the need for every other government program then people could work at walmart for fun or walmart could offer a wage that was enticing

respectfully i am of the opinion that you are mixing issues   paying a mortgage off early vs investing is a question that 's been well discussed at money se if you project a higher tax adjusted return on the investments than your current mortgage rate invest else pay the mortgage down   if the rent covers the mortgage you can maintain the investing it does n't matter for this discussion if the rent produces a profit so long as all expenses are covered   renting aside in the us now my mortgage is 3.5 2.6 after taxes so long as i expect a return well above this level long term i 'll stay investing and let the mortgage die its slow death another decade or so   i 'm sorry i can offer a formula it 's less about the same or more the mortgage is fixed right but the market return is unknown

well you are right about the market speaking but what you got wrong is what the market was talking about   the market does not dictate jobs it does dictate production and sales if they can produce and sell without jobs then they will   as far as coal being dead far from it   here are the actual numbers for global coal use   the unit is 1000 short tons   1980   1981   1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994    1995    1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    2001    2002    2003    2004   2005    2006   2007    2008    2009    2010    2011    2012    2013     as you can see the market has spoken and the conclusion is the exact opposite of what you claim not only is coal not dead it is surging   at current rates of use the proven coal reserves of the world will last well over 150 years   i suspect you will die and still be in denial about coal not being dead yet your kids will probably also be dead before coal dies and likely your grandkids as well

my advice to you act like responsible adults and owe up to your financial commitments   when you bought your house and took out a loan from the bank you made an agreement to pay it back if you breach this agreement you deserve to have your credit score trashed   what do you think will happen to the $ 100k+ if you decide to stiff the bank the bank will make up for its loss by increasing the mortgage rates for others that are taking out loans so responsible borrowers get to subsidize those that their responsibilities if you were in a true hardship situation i would be inclined to take a different stance but as you 've indicated you are perfectly able to make the payments you just do n't feel like it real estate fluctuates in value just like any other asset if a stock i bought drops in value does the government come and bail me out of course not what i find most problematic about your plan is that not only do you wish to breach your agreement but you are also looking for ways to conceal your breach please think about this best of luck with your decision

yes if you gift him with a large amount you may be liable for gift tax i believe the current limit is still $ 17k per person per person per year so between you and your spouse you could give him up to $ per year without triggering gift tax if you want to give a larger sum the standard workaround is an intra family loan for that phrase to learn more about it but basically you loan the money and then gift the payments on the loan this gives him the money up front spreading the gift over subsequent years it requires that you declare the interest that he is supposedly paying you as income there is a lower limit on the interest rate for these loans but it 's a fraction of a percent so this generally is n't a significant cost if you are able to structure the loan as a mortgage he may be able to deduct the interest from his taxes that usually requires a few hundred dollars if paperwork to set up i 've done it it works and one of the advantages is that it puts the exact terms of the on paper where everyone can agree to them which could be useful should there be arguments later on   when doing business with friends and relatives keeping it on a clear business contract basis is the best way to avoid destroying the friendship

ah   see this is where you have already misread me gt you attempt to construct a government and a society around false economic morality   why does morality have to be part of the actual solution   it does n’t   yet it can take into account moral values and immoral values   the solution should be utilitarian use that which works   but not the utilitarian that throws out things that do n’t quite work   no   it need to be a utilitarian method with foresight to see promise and to understand the weakness of intolerance   our current system is actually promoting separation building its own downfall   a new system needs to actually be built to create unity through diversity not for moral reasons but for simple survival and growth   and no one said people were n’t paid   that was all you bud   i was simply saying they were able to put aside differences and survive through major setbacks to accomplish great things   sticking around during tough times requires either fear of the alternative or a belief in the company or the goal   people are not always selfish

i would use neither method   taking a short example first with just three compounding periods with interest rate 10   the start value is 1 so after three years the value is the same as 1 + depreciating like inflation by 10 to demonstrate gets us back to = 1 appreciating and depreciating by 10 cancels out appreciating by 10 interest and depreciating by 3 inflation this is the same as 1 + 1 + = so for 50 years the result is 1 + 1 + = note you can of course use subtraction but the not using the inflation figure directly   e.g. edit this appears to be the fisher equation 2nd note further to comments here is a chart to illustrate how much the relative performance improves when inflation is accounted for   the first fund 's return is 6 and the second fund 's return varies from 3 to 6   inflation is 3

i used to trade on nasdaq using a us broker from the uk you need a way to convert your money into us $ s and have the cost of international money transfers i do n’t know if there are any laws in turkey that will stop you using a us broker    you are also on your own if anything goes wrong as the turkish police will not be interested and the us police will be very hard to deal with from turkey this all depends on turkey not the internet on the day you wish to trade on i used tdameritrade but it was a very long timer ago as uk brokers are now as cheap you should also consider uk based brokers as they   will also let you trade outside of the usa

i 'm assuming that you 're in the us   in that case the answer is that it depends on how your company set up its reimbursement plan   the irs recognizes accountable and plans   accountable plans have to meet certain requirements   anything else is   if you are reimbursed according to an accountable plan this is not income and should not be reported to the irs at all   if you are reimbursed under a plan then this is income but you might be able to get a deduction on your tax return if you itemize most established companies have accountable plans for normal business expenses more detail from irs

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income most business expenses are used to derive profits and income most individual expenses are not of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed regarding the interest on a mortgage being deductible whilst the principal is n't that is because it is the interest which is the annual expense by the way deductions for mortgage interest in the usa for a house you live in is only allowed due to social policy as there is no income rent being produced here unlike with an investment property

look for communities such as indians folks from india and this may be true about others as well but if one guy hires you and you do a decent job just a matter of time before your calendar will be loaded with requests from others in the community    how to reach out to them as for indians ask a local hindu temple about quite affordable many a times also take a couple of boxes of indian and distribute them around if you happen to go to the temple could yield sweet results    all the best   edit edited for clarity

what i am saying that in the time i have been importing from china i have learnt some important indirect lessons   one of the most valuable is that you really have to expect the unexpected as it most certainly will happen really no level of experience can counteract some of the things that happen but you must be prepared to recover from them   i think there are a lot of people online who like to blow smoke up their own ass and act like they are better than everyone else and that they never make mistakes i am just not one of these people    sometimes i make mistakes and sometimes i lose money i 'm just honest about it   i think this honesty helps people get that one step closer to obtaining their goals of importing by making this type of business actually sound like something that is real and instead of making it some shiny world that people ca n't just roll up their sleeves and get involved in   thanks for raising this point

michael pryor is 100 correct here this is almost certainly a scam if you want confirmation look at the feedback of the buyers and of folks who buy stuff from them you 'll typically find that they run through a bunch of low value auctions build up some feedback then all of the sudden buy and sell lots of laptops or other high value items it 's a big scam that has been going on for a decade or more if you are actually trying to sell things like computers overseas particularly to third world countries the sign of a legitimate buyer is usually someone who will have you ship to an import export company who handles the customs stuff and the bureaucratic nonsense required to deal with government on the other side i had a bunch of sun equipment in the late 90 's that was purchased by folks in latin america via ebay they bought from ebay because the local resellers had a monopoly on the products or could n't get sufficient quantities all of them used companies mostly in miami which handled the actual export at the customer 's expense

the debt ceiling does n't give the president permission to spend more money   the debt ceiling gives the treasury permission to pay our bills   also they shut down the government once and tried to shut it down 2 3 times over the course of obama 's presidency   so to say that everything was smooth is either forgetting what happened or choosing to ignore it

interest is calculated daily doing the math between 6 17 and 7 25 are 38 days 38 = interest per day between 7 25 and 8 17 are 23 days 23 = interest per day the minimal difference is because the principal has already gone down a little bit so you should expect x number of days for the next interest number coming up slowly decreasing as the remaining principal debt decreases note that this is equivalent of an annual interest rate of over 20 which is beyond acceptable in the current economy this is ridiculously high i recommend trying to get a refinancing with another provider you should be able to get it for a third of that

the bank should be able to issue you a new card without letting vendors roll over the recurring payments in fact i 've never had a bank move recurring payments to a new card automatically or even upon request they 've always told me to contact the vendor and give them my new card number so go back to the bank tell them specifically that you have a security issue and you want the new card issued without carrying over any recurring charges and see if they can do it properly if not 1 issue a charge back every time a bogus charge comes in this costs the vendor money and should convince them to stop trying to access your card it 's a hassle because you have to keep contacting the bank about the bad charges but it wo n't cost you more than time and a phone call or letter   the bank can tell you what their preferred process is for this 2 consider moving to a bank that is n't stupidly over helpful

probably not but they would have to remove old stock from the state after the one year grace period and they may have to entertain suits against them which would probably end in settlements in 2016 alone there was over 30 million paid out in sites all files pdfs    i have read there is somewhat of a cottage industry for those who seek out prop 65 violations just for the purpose of suing the manufacturer then there is the cost associated with the maintenance of complying with the ever changing regulations    i 'm sure there is more to it but i can see where a company would not want to label there products as cancer causing if it was not necessary people might also be more hesitant to purchase a product for there household if it 's labeled as cancer causing    additionally the us has its own hazard communication standards that require manufacturers to label any know as such    edit plus monsanto probably thinks it can do what it wants

do n't put money in things that you do n't understand etfs wo n't kill you ignorance will the leveraged ultra long short etfs hold swaps that are essentially bets on the daily performance of the market there is no guarantee that they will perform as designed at all and they frequently do not iirc in most cases you should n't even be holding these things overnight there are n't any hidden fees but derivative risk can wipe out portions of the portfolio and since the main asset in an ultra long short etf are swaps you 're also subject to counterparty risk if the investment bank the fund made its bet with can not meet it 's obligation you 're   may lost alot of money you need to read the prospectus carefully the re strategy the fund seeks daily investment results before fees and expenses that correspond to twice the inverse of the daily performance of the index the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day the prospectus re risk because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day ’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day ’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from twice the inverse of the return of the index over the same period a fund will lose money if the index performance is flat over time and it is possible that the fund will lose money over time even if the index ’s performance decreases as a result of daily rebalancing the index ’s volatility and the effects of compounding see principal risks if you want to hedge your investments over a longer period of time you should look at more traditional strategies like options if you do n't have the money to make an option strategy work you probably ca n't afford to speculate with leveraged etfs either
