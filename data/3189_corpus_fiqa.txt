without making specific recommendations it is worthwhile to point out the differing tax treatments for a roth ira investments in a roth ira will not be taxed when you withdraw them during retirement unless they change the law on that or something crazy so if you are thinking about investing in some areas with high risk and high potential reward e.g. emerging market stocks then the roth ira might be the place to do it that way if the investment works out you have more money in the account that wo n't ever be taxed we can talk about the possible risks of certain kinds of investments but this is not an appropriate forum to recommend for or against them specifically healthcare stocks are subject to political risk in the current regulatory climate brics are subject to political risks regarding the political and business climate in the relevant nations and the growth of their economies need not correspond with growth in the companies you hold in your portfolio energy stocks are subject to the world economic climate and demand for oil unless you 're talking alternative energy stocks which are subject to political risk regarding their subsidies and technological risk regarding whether or not their technologies pan out it is worth pointing out that any etf you invest in will have a prospectus and that prospectus will contain a section discussing the risks which could affect your investment read it before investing

yep most 401k options suck you 'll have access to a couple dozen funds that have been blessed by the organization that manages your account i recently rolled my 401k over into a self directed ira at fidelity and i have access to the entire mutual fund market and can trade stocks bonds if i wish   as for a practical solution for your situation the options you 've given us are vague hopefully you 're able to do research on what positions these funds hold and make your own determination quick overview energy utilities doing good right now because they are low risk generally high dividends these will underperform in the short term as the market recovers health care riskier and many firms are facing a sizable patent cliff i am avoiding this sector emerging markets i 'm also avoiding this due to the volatility and accounting issues but it 's up to you most large us companies have emerging markets exposure so not necessary for to invest in a dedicated fund in my unprofessional opinion bonds avoid bonds are at their highest levels in decades short term they might be ok but medium term the only place to go is down all of this depends on your age and your own particular investment objectives do n't listen to me or anyone else without doing your own research

you have some of the math right but are missing a few things here 's what i can offer if i leave anything out someone please expand or clarify rental income can be reduced by mortgage interest and maintenance costs as you mentioned but also by property tax payments association fees insurance costs landlord expenses and depreciation note that if you do n't live in the property for 3 years you 'll have to pay capital gains tax if when you sell the house you can live in it again for 2 of the last 5 years to avoid this many people recommend only assuming you will get 10 months of rental income a year to account for transitions between tenants difficult in finding new tenants and the occasional deadbeat tenant this also adds a buffer for unexpected problems you need to fix in the house if you ca n't at least break even on 10 months of income a year consider the risk i think there are also some cases where you need to repay depreciation amounts that you have deducted but i do n't know the details renting out a house can be fun and profitable but it 's very far from a sure thing i 'd always recommend preparation and caution and of course talking to professionals about the finances accounting and lease writing good luck

out of your seven recommendations one is up 14 one up 6 four are either even or down slightly and one is down a whopping 40 this reminds me of a recommendation earlier in the year provided by the motley fool to buy when it was around the $ 40 mark i had a quick look at it and thought gee there is no way i am buying those shares now they are just below $ 15 see the chart below   you have just learnt a valuable lesson by testing these recommendations without your real money never trust investment recommendations from analysts or anyone else get yourself educated so you understand what analysts are talking about and you can make a decision for yourself better still learn about technical analysis so you can decide for yourself whether it is the right time to buy or sell

why would anyone listen to someone else 's advice because they believe that the person advising them knows better than they do it 's as simple as that   the fact that you 're doing any research at all indeed the fact that you know about a site on the internet where personal finance questions get asked and answered puts you way ahead of the average member of the population when it comes to pensions   if you think you know better than the adviser and i do n't mean that aggressively just as a matter of fact then by all means do your own thing but remember about unknown unknowns you do n't know everything the adviser might say depending on your circumstances and changes to them over time

dividend paying stocks are not better   in particular shareholders will get taxed on the distribution while the company can most likely invest the money tax free in their operations   the shareholder then has the opportunity to decide when to pay the taxes when they sell their shares    companies pay dividends for a couple of reasons 1 to signal the strength of the company 2 to reward the shareholders oftentimes the executives of the firm get rather large rewards without having to sell shares they control 3 if they do n't have suitable investment opportunities in their field   ie they do n't have anything useful to do with the money

are you asking what does everybody else do spend   i think any amount less that 90 is safe but if depends on your goals   saving a dime of every dollar is a good rule of thumb for retirement so 90 is left to spend but i believe that is the wrong way to think about it   you have expenses some are optional and some are not   the percentages are n't the important thing   what is important is that you meet your obligations and meet your goals   everybody is different so i do n't think you can reasonably your percent of expenses to somebody else in setting up your budget go the simple route   you can always get super detailed later if you want income as you have extra funds be sure you have an emergency fund ~6 months of expenses and a fully funded retirement   pay off any outstanding debts   if you are so fortunate to have some left over then revisit the savings amount or become an investor like many people here or have fun and go on vacations or buy a nicer car   the point being you will know you can afford it if you put detailed categories under those main categories that will give you a picture of where you spend you money and you can fix that if desire   if it bothers you that you spend 15 of your income on imported classical music you can adjust that with a habit change

typically a transfer of money is n't taxed in and of itself if they send you $ 1000 and you send them goods your profit is what would be taxed not the full amount sent to you you need to keep track of all money you spend to acquire the goods and all money coming in so you can declare the profit you 've made as income your question appears to be less about personal finance and more about running a small business

this might not map well because personal finance is not the global economy but let 's start by talking about this in terms of the cost of a loan vs the gain of an investment    if you can buy a house with a mortgage at 3 but make 7 on average in the stock market you should take as as possible to pay that off and invest every penny you can spare in the markets   heck if you can take on even more debt at 3 you should still do the same   now imagine you have the power to literally print money but doing so is effectively a form of loan to yourself   we call the interest on that loan inflation and it comes out to roughly 2 basically the same rate that us treasuries pay they are n't strictly locked but they rarely drift far apart   so if you can print money at 1 you should rationally print as much money as you possibly can to buy us treasuries at   but someone has to take that money off your hands pallets of money in a warehouse are n't worth any more than the paper they 're made of   there we get into trade imbalances whether printing money costs you 0.1 or 10 or 1000 per year depends on whether your country is on average making or losing money on international trade i 'm glossing over a hell of a lot there as full disclosure and by how much   if you 're printing money as fast as you can just to buy food to stay alive with zero exports you 're screwed if your country exports $ 10 to the us or equivalents for every $ 1 you import the rest of that is essentially invested in usd in that you did n't need to print it yourself just to feed your people

think of it this way if you traveled back through time one month with perfect knowledge of aapl 's stock price over that period which happens to peak then return to its old price at the end of the period would n't you pay more for an american option another way to think about options is as an insurance policy   would n't you pay more for a policy that covered fire and earthquake losses as opposed to just losses from earthquakes lastly and perhaps most directly one of the more common reasons people exercise as opposed to sell an american option before expiration is if an unexpected dividend larger than remaining time value of the option was just announced that 's going to be paid before the option contract expires   because only actual stockholders get the dividends not options holders   a holder of an american option has the ability to exercise in time to grab that dividend a european option holder does n't have that ability less flexibility what you 're paying for really = lower option premium

the amount you are earning in the savings account is insignificant since you would only have the money in the account for 1 month after purchasing the car   the instant 1.5 cashback or travel mile reward on the other hand can be significant however it is not normal for a car dealership to allow you to put $ 16k on a credit card   the reason is that the fees that the dealer has to pay to process your credit card would be too burdensome   car dealers have a much smaller profit margin on their sales than a typical retail store so if the dealer has to pay 3 or 4 of the sales price in credit card fees it just eats up too much of their profit if the dealer does allow you to put the entire purchase price on a credit card be aware that they have already factored in their processing fees into the price   you might be able to get a better than 1.5 discount by offering to pay with cash instead

in this scenario the date of income is the date on which the contract has been signed even if you received the actual money settlement later regardless of the ny special law for residency termination that is the standard rule for recognition of income during a cash not installments sale the fact that you got the actual money later does n't matter which is similar to selling stocks on a public exchange when you sell stocks through your broker on a public exchange you still recognize the income on the day of the sale not on the day of the settlement this is called the constructive receipt doctrine the irs publication 538 has this to say about the constructive receipt constructive receipt    income is constructively received when an    amount is credited to your account or made available to you without    restriction you need not have possession of it if you authorize    someone to be your agent and receive income for you you are    considered to have received it when your agent receives it income is    not constructively received if your control of its receipt is subject    to substantial restrictions or limitations once you signed the contract the money has essentially been credited to your account with the counter party and unless they 're bankrupt or otherwise insolvent you have no restrictions over it and also more specifically for your case you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to postpone paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction timing wire transfer is akin to holding and not depositing a check from this perspective so unless there was a restriction that was lifted after you moved out of new york i doubt you can claim that you could n't have received it before moving out i.e. you have in fact constructively received it

you probably will not find to many places if any that give you live quotes on options because for the general public there is not that high of a demand most people do not even know what stock options are   you can get update on some sites like cnbc but you will have refresh constantly to get the latest option prices   you can also try an online broker most of whom will let you have access to their tools and quotes if you sign up for an account some require a deposit before you can access those tools and some do n't personally i use td ameritrade and i do not believe they require a deposit to use their tools but do n't quote me on that

this may not be entirely scientific but as a landlord my usual approach is just to do a search for rental properties on craigslist for comparable homes in the neighborhood there are all kinds of formulas professional property managers use but in the end these listings are the ones you are going to be competing with for tenants also it is n't super accurate but online services like can give you some numbers for rental houses that include those that are n't currently advertising

all else being equal you should look for more volatile riskier stocks technically it was all time value the entire value of an out of the money option is time value    what 's confusing is that time value is affected by numerous variables only one of which is time the reason volatility is the one to look at is that all the rest are likely already intuitive to you or are too minor an influence to worry about current risk free interest rates and a stock 's dividend payout during the life of the option affect the value of the call but are usually minor    higher interest rates makes call values higher and higher dividend yield makes call values lower longer time to expiration will increase the value of the call but you 're pretty likely already focused on that the strike price 's proximity to the current price affects the call 's value agreeing to sell a stock 5 above current levels will pay more than agreeing to sell it 10 above current levels but again this is likely obvious to you volatility or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day is almost certainly the variable that 's not already obvious stocks that jump all over the place have higher volatility than those that move more predictably      the reason that options calls and puts cost more on higher volatility names is that options payout is   in the case of calls the option holder gets all the upside but none of the downside other than what they paid for the      if one stock goes up or down $ 5 every day and another goes up or down $ 20 every day and you could pay some fixed amount to get that stock 's upside but not have any exposure to its downside other than that fixed amount you 'd pay more for the one that pays you $ 20 or $ 0 than you would for the one that pays you $ 5 or $ 0     that 's why higher volatility meaning larger daily moves makes optimum prices higher

to add to 's solid answer i would suggest sitting down and analyzing what your priorities are about paying off the student loan debt versus investing that money immediately regardless the first thing you should do is as michael suggested pay off the credit card debt since it looks like you will be having some new expenses coming up soon rent possibly a new car as part of that you should calculate what your rent and associated bills will cost you on a monthly basis including saving a bit each month and see if you can afford to pay everything without incurring new debt i 'd recommend trying to come up with several scenarios to see how cheaply you can live roommates maybe you can figure out a way to go without a car etc   if for whatever reason you find you ca n't afford everything then i would suggest taking a portion of your inheritance to at least pay off enough of your student loans so that you can afford all of your costs per month and then save or invest the rest you can invest all you like but if you do n't live within your means it wo n't do you any good finally be aware that you may have other factors that come into play that may override financial considerations i found myself in a situation similar to yours and in my case i chose to pay off my debts not because it necessarily made the best financial sense but that because of those other considerations paying off that debt meant i had a significant level of stress removed from my life and a lot more peace of mind

before anything else pay down any debt at higher interest rates best guaranteed return on investment you can get what do you plan to use the money for when with how much advance planning how risk tolerant are you and how patient are you would you see a dip in an asset 's value as lost money or a buying opportunity a good financial advisor and i mean one who is only an advisor and not trying to sell you anything but their services can take answers of that sort and recommend a mix of investment types that will suit your needs knowing that balance you can the pick specific investments to suit i remain a fan of low fee index funds as a painless way to get good diversification with some small percentage for more active trading if you really want to invest the effort and are convinced you can beat the odds other answers here on the personal finance discussion go into this in detail so i do n't think it 's worth repeating here unless there 's something really unusual about your situation

for the period 1950 to 2009 if you adjust the s&p 500 for inflation and account for dividends the average annual return comes out to exactly source currently inflation is around 2   so your 2 apy is a 0 real return where the stock market return is 7   i.e. on average stocks have a return that is higher by 7    if you mix in bonds 70 stocks to 30 bonds your real returns will drop to around 5.5 but you are safer in individual years bonds often have good years when stocks have bad years    we 're making a bit of a false dichotomy here   we 're talking about returns on stocks in retirement accounts versus returns on cds in regular accounts   you can buy stocks in regular accounts and it is legally possible to have a cd in a retirement account   so you can get bankruptcy protection and tax advantages with a cd

i 'm not the op but i 'm happy to give a brief overview   basically pre jobs act there were a lot of limits on who could make an equity investment in a non public company i.e. a startup or even a hedge fund there were some loopholes but basically you had to be an accredited investor an accredited investor was someone who either has made $ 200,000 + $ 300,000 + for married people for the past two years and expects to make that much again in the current year alternately they could have a net worth of $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence there was also a limit of 500 investors for a non public company before the company had to become public they did n't really have to ipo but they did have to file their financials with the sec so the effect was basically the same finally non public companies were prohibited from seeking investment through advertising basically they could n't take out an ad in a paper or event send a mass email and say hey we 're looking to raise a $ 1 million funding round contact us if you 're interested   okay now after the jobs act   the jobs act changed a the number and type of investors who could make equity investments in a non public company b the regulation of advertising for investments   post jobs private companies could have 2,000 shareholders and 500 of those could be unaccredited e.g. regular people like you and i the change in the number of shareholders is n't really that important because it 's just shareholders of record but that 's another post for another day there are still some requirements for unaccredited shareholder which i do n't remember off the top of my head i think you have to have income of at least $ 40k they also changed the solicitation ban so it 's possible that you might see an ad in the wsj someday for a startup company venture capital fund hedge fund etc   there are some other things it changed but imo those are the two most important

yield can be thought of as the interest rate you would receive from that investment in the form of a dividend for stocks or interest payments on a bond   the yield takes into account the anticipated amount to be received per share unit per year and the current price of the investment    of course the yield is not a guaranteed return like a savings account   if the investment yield is 4 when you buy it can drop in value such that you actually lose money during your hold period despite receiving income from the dividend or interest payments

i 'm not sure about your first two options   but given your situation a variant of option three seems possible    that way you do n't have to throw away your appraisal although it 's possible that you 'll need to get some kind of addendum related to the repairs    you also do n't have your liquid money tied up long term   you just need to float it for a month or two while the repairs are being done   the bank should be able to you for the loan    note that you might be better off without the loan   you 'll have to pay interest on the loan and there 's extra red tape    i 'd just prefer not to tie up so much money in this property    i do n't understand this   with a loan you are even more tied up   anything you do you have to work with the bank   sure you have $ 80k more cash available with the loan but it does n't sound like you need it   with the loan the bank makes the profit   if you buy in cash you lose your interest from the cash but you save paying the interest on the loan   in general the interest rate on the loan will be higher than the return on the cash equivalent    a fourth option would be to pay the $ 15k up front as earnest money   the seller does the repairs through your chosen contractor   you pay the remaining $ 12.5k for the downpayment and buy the house with the loan   this is a more complicated purchase contract though so cash might be a better option    you can easily evaluate the difficulty of the second option   call a different bank and ask   if you explain the situation they 'll let you know if they can use the existing appraisal or not   also consider asking the appraiser if there are specific banks that will accept the appraisal   that might be quicker than randomly choosing banks    it may be that your current bank just is n't used to investment properties   requiring the previous owner to do repairs prior to sale is very common in residential properties   it sounds like the loan officer is trying to use the rules for residential for your investment purchase   a different bank may be more inclined to work with you for your actual purchase

i 've been thinking about this   here 's what i came up with   please let me know what you think     1 the whole world is on a fiat money system   the central banks were all easing together in a coordinated way   so currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other also the price of goods is n't rising nearly as quickly as the money supply is being expanded because    2 the growth of the internet globalization are deflationary because skilled people in poor countries have access to the global marketplace and are willing to produce far more per dollar than rich country citizens   3 the growth of inequality is deflationary   as wealth concentrates at the top there are fewer and fewer customers who can afford the products services that are being mass produced   so there 's a mismatch between high supply and low demand   4 a poor slow economy low spending debt defaults and business personal bankruptcy is deflationary   we treat credit as money and when debt is wiped out so is the credit that we were accounting for in the money supply   5 the money created over the last 10 years or so has n't had a chance to trickle down yet it 's still tied up in financial market instruments stocks bonds etfs etc held by mostly institutional investors until the next big bubble bursts    so there are many deflationary forces to balance out against the money creation

espp is common among us companies often with a framework similar to your outline   in the us some allow sales of shares to be considered qualifying subject to capital gains rather than ordinary income tax if they are sold at least 2 years after the enrollment date and at least 1 year after the purchase date   these details can vary from one plan to another and will be stated in the company 's espp enrollment documents    do look at the high and low values of the stock over the last year   if it swings up and down more than 15 or whatever the discount is then that risk should be a factor in your decision   if the stock is trending upward over the long term and you are confident in the durability of the company then you might favor holding

it 's not a question with a single right answer   other answers have addressed some aspects my case may provide some guidance as to one way of looking at some of the issues when i had student loans the interest rate was and i could get more than that as the return on a savings account   at the time i could get a whole year 's worth of loan at the start of the year save it and draw from the savings partly because i had a little working capital saved already   importantly in my case the loans were use it or lose it if i did n't take the loan out by about halfway through each academic year it was no longer available to me the difference in interest rates was probably similar to what you can get with a careful choice of savings account and 0 on the loan i did this in the 90s when interest rates were higher over a four year degree the interest i earned this way added up to no more than about £ 100 which went towards offsetting the fact i would be paying interest after graduation if you can clear the loan before you pay any interest it would give you a return but a small one that could easily be eroded by rate changes or errors on your part like not keeping on top of the paperwork   it still may be beneficial to take out the loans depending on your capital needs in my case it made buying a house after graduating much easier as we still had money for the deposit downpayment and student loan rates were much lower than mortgage rates 100 mortgages were also available then but expensive stands for retail price index a measure of inflation

does the 457(b plan allow for the rollover of other retirement funds into it and do you have very specific reasons for wanting to roll over your sep ira into the 457(b plan instead of into some other ira plan with a different custodian for example if you already have a traditional ira is there any reason why your sep ira should not be rolled over into the traditional ira with regard to the question about separate accounts once upon a time rolling over money from an employment retirement plan e.g. 401k into a traditional ira required establishing a separate account called a rollover traditional ira so that the rolled over money and the earnings were not commingled with standard traditional ira money resulting from personal contributions this was so that the account owner had the option of rolling over the separately kept money into a new employer 's retirement plan if such a rollover was permitted by the new 401k plan if one did not want to ever roll over money into a new employer plan one had to write a letter to the custodian telling them that commingling was ok you never wanted to put that money into another 401k plan the law changed some time later and the concept of rollover iras holding non commingled funds has disappeared   with that as my answer to your question is that perhaps the law did not change with respect to 457(b plans and so the money that you want to rollover into the 457(b plan needs to be kept separate and not commingled with your contributions via payroll deduction to the 457(b plan in case you want to ever roll over the sep ira money into another sep ira hence separate accounts are needed one to hold your sep ira money and one to hold your contributions via payroll deductions

you talk about an individual not being advised to sell or purchase in response to trends in the market in such a buy and hold strategy but think of this for a moment you buy stock abc for $ 10 when both the market as a whole and stock abc are near the bottom of a bear market as say part of a value buying strategy you 've now held stock abc for a number of years and it is performing well hitting $ 50 there is all good news about stock abc profit increases year after year in double digits would you consider selling this stock just because it has increased 400 it could start falling in a general market crash or it could keep going up to $ 100 or more maybe a better strategy to sell abc would be to place a trailing stop of say 20 on the highest price reached by the stock so if abc falls say in a general market correction by less than 20 off its high and then rebounds and goes higher you keep it if abc however falls by more than 20 off its high you automatically sell it with your stop loss order you may give 20 back to the market if the market or the stock crashes but if the stock continues going up you benefit from more upside in the price take aapl as an example if you bought aapl in march 2009 after the gfc for about $ 100 would you have sold it in december 2011 when it hit $ 400 if you did you would have left money on the table if instead you placed a trailing stop loss on aapl of 20 you would have been still in it when it hit its high of $ in september 2012 you would have finally been stopped out in november 2012 for around the $ 560 mark and made an extra $ 160 per share and if your thinking how about if i decided to sell aapl at $ 700 well i do n't think many would have picked $ 700 as the high in hindsight the main benefit of using stop losses is that it takes your emotions out of your trading especially your exits

i would recommend not paying it off early for 2 key reasons if you are a resident of the u.s. you get tax deductibility of mortgage interest which as pointed out in previous posts reduces the effective interest rate on your mortgage never in your life will you ever be allowed to obtain such high leverage at such a low rates you can probably get higher returns with not much risk @joetaxpayer mentioned various statistics regarding returns when investing in equities even though they are a decent bet over the long term you can get an even better risk reward tradeoff by considering municipal bonds if you are in the u.s. and invest in the municipal bonds of your state the interest income will be both federal and state tax free   in other words if you were making 3.5 investing in equities your after tax returns would be significantly less depending on your tax bracket whereas investment grade municipal bond etfs will yield probably the same or higher and have no tax they are also significantly less volatile even though they have default risk the risk is small since most of these bonds are backed by future tax obligations or other income streams derived from hard assets such as tolls or property furthermore an etf will have a portfolio of these bonds which will also dampen the impact of any individual defaults in essence you are getting paid this spread for simply having access to credit take advantage of it while you can

in the short term this question is pretty simple are occasional use grid scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators   home solar is an amazingly good deal now economically the question is n't whether it 'll take over most home power generation it 's how fast that will happen   currently at least where i live the grid is still a good deal for backup power if that changes then people will stop using it   you can get a gas generator to cover a normal sized home installed for in places with gas the price for running the generator looks comparable to grid power per kwh   so no i would n't pay triple the price for grid power or buy a ton of extra storage i 'd get a natural gas generator and handle solar downtime locally

if you have income it should appear on your tax return if you are a non resident that would be 1040nr with the ebay income appearing on line 21 since this is unrelated to your studies this income will not be covered by the tax treaties for most countries and you 'll pay full taxes on it keep in mind that the irs may decide that you 're actually having a business in which case you 'll be required to attach schedule c to your tax return and maybe pay additional taxes mainly self employment also the uscis may decide that you 're actually having a business regardless of how the irs sees it in which case you may have issues with your green card for low income from occasional sales you should n't have any issues but if it is something systematic that you spend significant time on and earn significant amounts of money you may get into trouble what 's systematic and how much is significant is up to a lawyer to tell you

investment strategies abound bonds can be part of useful passive investment strategy but more active investors may develop a good number of reasons why buying and selling bonds on the short term a few examples also note that there is no guarantee in bonds as you imply by it to a guaranteed stock dividend bond issuers can default causing bond investors to lose part of all of their original investment as such if one believes the bond issuer may suffer financial distress it would be ideal to sell off the investment

from wikipedia usage because ev is a capital structure neutral metric it is useful when    comparing companies with diverse capital structures price earnings    ratios for example will be significantly more volatile in companies    that are highly leveraged stock market investors use ev ebitda to compare returns between    equivalent companies on a risk adjusted basis they can then    their own choice of debt levels in practice equity    investors may have difficulty accurately assessing ev if they do not    have access to the market quotations of the company debt it is not    sufficient to substitute the book value of the debt because a the    market interest rates may have changed and b the market 's perception    of the risk of the loan may have changed since the debt was issued    remember the point of ev is to the different risks and    costs of different capital structures buyers of controlling interests in a business use ev to compare    returns between businesses as above they also use the ev valuation    or a debt free cash free valuation to determine how much to pay for    the whole entity not just the equity they may want to change the    capital structure once in control technical considerations data availability unlike market capitalization where both the market price and the    outstanding number of shares in issue are readily available and easy    to find it is virtually impossible to calculate an ev without making    a number of adjustments to published data including often subjective    estimations of value in practice ev calculations rely on reasonable estimates of the    market value of these components for example in many professional    valuations avoiding temporal when using valuation multiples such as ev ebitda and ev ebit the    numerator should correspond to the denominator the ev should    therefore correspond to the market value of the assets that were used    to generate the profits in question excluding assets acquired and    including assets disposed during a different financial reporting    period this requires ev for any mergers and acquisitions    whether paid in cash or equity significant capital investments or    significant changes in working capital occurring after or during the    reporting period being examined ideally multiples should be    calculated using the market value of the weighted average capital    employed of the company during the comparable financial period when calculating multiples over different time periods e.g. historic    multiples vs forward multiples ev should be adjusted to reflect the    weighted average invested capital of the company in each period in your question you stated the market cap is driven by the share price and the share price is    determined by buyers and sellers who have access to data on cash and    debts and factor that into their decision to buy or sell note the first point under technical considerations there and you will see that the access to data on cash and debts is n't quite accurate here so that is worth noting as for alternatives there are many other price ratios one could use such as price earnings price book value price sales and others depending on how one wants to model the company the better question is what kind of investing strategy is one wanting to use where there are probably hundreds of strategies at least let 's take apple as an example back on april 23 2014 they announced earnings through march 29 2014 which is nearly a month old when it was announced now a month later one would have to estimate what changes would be made to things there thus getting accurate real time values is n't realistic discounted cash flow is another approach one can take of valuing a company in terms of its future earnings computed back to a present day lump sum

there are a couple of things you could do but it may depend partly on the type of orders your broker has available to you firstly if you are putting your limit order the night before after close of market at the top of the bids you may be risking missing out if bid offer prices increase by the time the market opens the next day on the other hand if bid offer prices fall at the open of the next day you should get your order filled at or below your limit price secondly you could be available at the market open to see if prices are going up or down and then work out the price you want to buy at then and work out the quantity you can buy at that price i personally do n't like this method because you usually get too emotional start chasing the market if prices start rising or start regretting buying at a price and prices fall straight afterwards my preferred method is this third option if your broker provides stop orders you can use these to both get into and out of the market how they work when trying to get into the market is that once you have done your analysis and picked a price that you would want to purchase at you put a stop buy order in for example the price closed at $ 9.90 the previous day and there has been resistance at $ 10.00 so you would put a stop buy trigger if the price goes over $ 10 say $ 10.01 if your stop buy order gets triggered you can have either a buy market order or a limit order above $ 10.01 say $ the market order would go through immediately whilst the limit order would only go through if the price continues going to $ or above the advantage of this is that you do n't get emotional trying to buy your securities whilst sitting in front of the screen you do your analysis and set your prices whilst the market is closed you only buy when the security is rising not falling as your aim is to be in long term you should n't be concerned about buying a little bit higher than the previous days close on the other hand if you try and buy when the price is falling you do n't know when it will stop falling it is better to buy when the price shows signs of rising rather than falling always follow the trend

you can find lots of answers to this question by googling   i found at least five pages about this in 30 seconds most of these pages seem to say that if you must convert cash converting it in the destination country is probably better because you are essentially buying a product in this case dollars and it will cheaper where the supply is greater   there are more dollars in the usa than there are in portugal so you may be able to get them cheaper there   some of those pages mention caveats if you 're trying to exchange some little known currency which people might not accept but this is n't an issue if you 're converting euros some of those pages specifically recommend against airport currency exchanges since they have a captive audience of people who want to convert money right away they face less competition and may offer worse rates   of course the downside of doing the exchange in the usa is that you 'll be less familiar with where to do it   i did find some people saying that for this reason it 's better to do it in your own country where you can shop around at leisure to find the best rate   that said if you take your time shopping around shifts in the underlying exchange rate in the interim could erase any savings you find it 's worth noting though that the main message from all these pages is the same do n't exchange cash at all if you can possibly avoid it   use a credit card or atm card to do the exchange   the exchange rate is usually better and you also avoid the risks associated with carrying cash

there are lots of reasons for the differences in price can you go to a bank b forex bureau and c central bank and post back both bid and offer prices at a given time so we can consider the spread what you 've said above for a and b are presumably offer prices because they are higher than the c central bank price if a bank or bureau bid price was higher than the central bank offer price then you could buy from the central bank and then sell them to a bureau for a higher price an almost no risk arbitrage other than the car to deliver the funds from central bank to bureau what you 've posted is a a bank will sell you 1 usd for 3.4 b a bureau will sell you 1 usd for 3.7 c we can see the bid offer for central bank is which means the central bank if you have an account will sell you 1 usd for you clearly want to buy usd from the central bank then the bank then the bureau anyway the reason for these differences is all to do with liquidity conditions in the local areas the customer types and the frequency of orders versus inventory think about it the central bank has the most frequency of orders and the biggest customers so it offers the lower price then the bank and then the bureau i think the bureau is the worst price there you have to explain further

if you think about it it 's really all one big pot of money   the idea behind an emergency fund is that you want to make sure your financial life has stability it 's not going to be suddenly driven into the red below $ 0   as long as that does n't happen you can figure out how to live your life as you want the reason we separate out an emergency fund is to simplify decision making   in theory every single purchase you make should include a consideration of how it you   every $ 100 you spend on groceries is $ 100 you wo n't be able to bring to bear if you get fired or have a major accident   in practice this would be a crippling way of thinking about things   you do n't know what emergencies can hit you nor when they will hit   that 's why they 're emergencies   if you had to think about them all the time it 'd be horrible   you would end up simply not thinking about it like most people and then the emergency hits when you do n't have enough cash to stay solvent the purpose of an emergency fund is to help make these decisions easier   if you have money set aside for emergencies that you only have to think about every now and then you can make the decisions in the rest of your financial life without too much concern for them   you do n't have to worry about that $ 100 in groceries because you are confident that if an emergency hits that $ 100 wo n't be the straw that broke the 's back because you have reserves to draw on so you should define an emergency fund in a way which is most helpful for you to remain stable and solvent without having to fret about it too much   for most people the criteria for tapping that fund is very high because the goal is to not have to think about it all that much   if you wanted to you could feel free to lump those medium predictability items into the emergency fund but it just means you have to spend more time and effort thinking about the state of the fund   every medium predictability purchase has to come with the thought process what is the state of the emergency fund could this purchase meaningfully destabilize my ability to handle emergencies   your emergency fund might yo yo under these extra purchases which could force you to think about the state of your emergency fund for normal purchases   that 'd be bad different people might want to think about things different ways   i 'm a big picture guy so i prefer to think about all of my assets as one big account when i make a lot of my decisions   my wife on the other hand prefers not to have to think that way when she makes her purchases   for her having a very discrete emergency fund has great value   for me it has less   so when i look at the finances i choose to lump the emergency funds in with say the funds to re do our backyard something we are looking at doing over the next 2 5 years   for me that is the most natural way to deal with analyzing the risks i just have to be aware of how backyard purchases interact with our safety net   my wife prefers to keep those funds separate in her head so that she can look at how to spend money on the backyard without thinking about how it affects our emergency   while complicated it shows that even within a household it 's possible to think about emergency funding two different ways   it causes minimal headaches though a fair bit of book keeping so define emergency fund however suits you and your life best   however practically speaking most people find it desirable to not put those medium predictability purchases into the same bucket as emergencies   those that do find it desirable to put them in the same bucket typically have a personal reason for why that suits their needs better

general advice for novice investors is to have the majority of your holdings be denominated in your home currency as this reduces volatility which can make people and related to your second question prevents all sorts of confusion a rising cad actually decreases the value for you of your current usd stock after all the same amount of usd now buys you less in cad an exception to the rule can be made if you would use usd often in your daily life yet your income is cad in this case owning stock denominated in usd can form a natural hedge in your life usd goes up > your relative income goes down but stock value goes up and visa versa   keep in mind mentioned in the that an us company with a listing in cad is still going to be affected by price swings of usd

when you set up a short sale for equities you are borrowing stock from someone else typically another client at the broker   the broker usually an agreement to let your shares be borrowed for short sales in your account details   so if client a wants to short a stock he borrows stock from client b to do the short sale it 's usually not this direct as they can borrow from many clients   if client b then wants to sell his shares if the broker ca n't shift around assets to find another client 's shares to let client a borrow then he has to close the short position out because he does n't have the shares in the brokerage to let client a borrow to short anymore

you should establish a strategy eg a specific mix of investments funds which has the long term of risk returns and diversification you want and stick to that strategy rebalancing periodically to maintain your strategic ratios those investments   yes that means you will sell things that have been doing well and buy others that have been doing less well but that 's to be expected it 's exactly what happens when you buy low sell high

i switched from engineering into finance into an entry level position as an analyst on the investment side i can tell you about my experience and how i did it   yes it is incredibly hard to get a position on the buyside investment management does n't scale well with numbers adding more analysts typically does n't improve results i.e. buffett and munger made all the investment decisions at berkshire hathaway the most successful investment team is a two man team running more than a hundred billion dollars of assets so teams are very small a large amount of money goes through the hands of very few people so naturally the pay is very big the recruiters are not lying when they say there are hundreds of applicants chasing each one of those jobs   i tried asking my friends and family but being a first generation american most of the people i know are blue collar types that work with their hands i had some success tapping into the alumni network i got many responses with advice but no interviews it does n't help that the finance world is currently shrinking and there are talented people losing their jobs i had the most success attending my schools career fair if you graduated from one of the top schools the firms that are recruiting will still show up also check your schools career office all the top schools i know of have on campus interviews they are generally open to alumni it is summer right now but on campus recruiting season will start in the fall you should be able to get some interviews through your school   now the most important thing you need to do is to differentiate yourself what are you doing right now are you working in some other area of finance or a different field altogether i think the best way to do it and it is how i did it is to invest your own money if you are in an interview and you say you invest your own money you are pretty much guaranteed that you will be explaining one of your investment theses for the next half hour this is effectively what you will be doing in the real job if you get it firms want to hire someone who can start working they do n't want to pay you that big money only to find that you ca n't do anything for the next year or two before they cut you so you have to prove that you can do the job interns do it by working for cheap for a summer or two someone who graduated already can do it by claiming that they do it on the side and then backing that up by being able to explaining positions intelligently you will not get the job if it looks anything like /r investing there is also something hypocritical if you say that you should be paid of money because you are capable of managing money well that is what you are claiming by applying to an investment job and you do n't manage your own money and you have n't formulated any investment theses students typically wo n't be able to do this because they do n't have any money to invest so they get their jobs through the internship route

the seriousness of your situation depends on whether your girlfriend was owed a refund for each tax return she failed to file or whether she owed additional money if she owed money on one or more of the tax returns she failed to file stop it is time to consult a lawyer at the very least you need to contact an accountant who specialises in this sort of thing she will owe interest and penalties and may be liable for criminal prosecution there are options available and lawyers who specialise in this sort of thing e.g. this one from a simple google search if she is in this position you need professional help and you need it soon so you can make a voluntary disclosure and head off criminal prosecution assuming the taxes are fairly simple you are likely looking at a few thousand dollars but probably less than $ 7,500 for professional help there will be substantial penalties assessed as well for any taxes owing if you wait until the cra starts proceedings you are most likely looking at $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 assuming the matter is not too complicated and would be facing the possibility of a jail term not exceeding five years if she was due a refund on every single one of the tax returns she failed to file or at least if she did not owe additional money you are probably in a situation you can deal with yourself she will want to file all of the tax returns as soon as possible but will not be assessed a penalty i have personally filed taxes several months late a number of times when i was owed a refund you may still want to consider professional help but it is probably not necessary under no circumstances should she allow her father near her finances again ever you should also be careful to trust any responses to this question including my response because we are unlikely to be professional accountants i certainly am not you are well outside the abilities of an h&r block accountant in this matter and need a real certified accountant and/or a lawyer who specialises in failure to file cases

you do not need to inform your employer of your additional activity but it is your responsibility not to work for more than 48 hours per week as long as you are an employee so if you are working 38 hours for your employer you may not work for yourself for more than 10 hours it is however not so easy in practice to draw the line between work and a hobby as long as you are not being paid by the hour the main reason to present your employer with an addition to your work contract is to make it legally very clear that he holds no intentions to claim copyright to your work he may attempt to do something funky like claim your home computer is in fact a work computer because you used it once a month to work from home and your work contract may contain a paragraph that all work performed on a work computer results in copyright ownership for your employer i have no idea how likely this is in practice but this is the reason i know is commonly given as legal advice to have a contract so the normal contract you present your employer with says in order to earn user contribution money from a website you need to register as a sole proprietor and pay trade tax and sales tax alternatively you claim small trade exception which also makes a tax return mandatory i would guess however and this is not legal advice in any way just my guess that a couple of contributions towards server cost in a strictly non profit endeavor is not commercial at all but private in the same way that you may write an invoice to someone you sold your old bike to or a kid may get paid to mow someone 's lawn based on that guess my non legal advice recommendation is to take the contributions and do nothing else as long as the amount is nowhere near breaking even if you count your work input

by living in sweden and having a swedish personal identification number you are required to declare your entire worldwide income for tax purposes with the swedish tax authorities it would seem to not make any difference if some of that income is kept outside of sweden a company that has no permanent base of operations within sweden should not deduct any preliminary taxes for an employee that lives in sweden rather the employee should apply for special a tax sa tax status and pay the taxes that had the company had a permanent base of operations in sweden the company would have paid the information available on the tax authority 's web site in english seems limited but the relevant page in swedish in your situation is very likely fast i there is a summary at paying taxes for individuals particularly do note the summary section when staying for at least six months you are considered as resident in sweden for tax purposes and are liable for taxation in sweden on all of your worldwide income you must also file a swedish income tax return your tax return must be filed no later than may 2nd of the year after the fiscal year as well as that if you stay in sweden for a continuous period of at least six months you are considered to be resident in sweden as a resident you are liable for taxation in sweden on all of your worldwide income in some cases a tax treaty with with your ordinary country of residence   may limit the swedish taxation for a more detailed answer including which exact forms you need to fill out and what data is needed i strongly recommend that you either contact they are usually quite nice to deal with and they tend to realize that everyone benefits from getting the tax paperwork and payments right from the beginning or find an attorney specializing in swedish tax law they even point out themselves that my emphasis the practical applications of these rules are relatively complicated and for more information you can contact the tax information at

there 's about 10 trillion in wiki and about 2.8 trillion of us the value of united states currency in in the world neither of these is anywhere large enough to be used for all the transactions in the world for example about 4 trillion a wiki changes hands in the currency markets alone if that were required to be cash or gold it would be impossible to do so and you 'd suffer from more poorly priced goods since markets could not adjust as quickly so vendors would charge more premium to handle the risk   yes there is not and has not been enough cash in circulation to run the world economy there is also vastly too little gold unless you want to strangle commerce due to not being enough money to trade    gt posing as the money supply   all money is debt and always has been money is a placeholder that you can trade for goods later meaning someone owes you a thing the value of that money is the debt they or society owes you for something you already did to get that money so there is no posing just most do n't understand money how it originated why it exists or why it works they never ask the question how does money come into   gt does defaulting on ones debt create inflation since that money is still in the system and not being paid off    probably not much loans are made expecting some default so the interest others pay on their loans helps offset the defaulted ones if loans become riskier the interest demanded increases so the lender still if they do their risk analysis well and no external events break their expectations makes money   when you pay off a debt that money as you 're paying it is likely being lent in other loans so paying it off does not do much if you could pay off about 100 trillion in debt into the us economy in one payment you might break some things

this is a very trivial scam flow is like this send money to mr. x you in this case call mr. x and ask for the money back because mistake usually they ask for a wire transfer cash gift cards prepaid cards or something else irreversible mr. x initiates transfer back to scammer accept the transfer from mr. x dispute the original transfer or otherwise cancel it through the mr. x can not dispute his transfer to the scammer since it was genuinely and intentionally initiated by mr. x. end up with twice the money at the expense of mr. x in other countries this is usually done with forged checks but transfers can work just as well as long as the transfer can be retroactively canceled or reversed the scam works you mentioned money laundering this is definitely a possibility as well they transfer dirty money to you from sources and you send a gift to them with a clear paper trail when the audit comes the only proof is that you actually sent them the gift and no one will believe your story you 'll have to explain why the mr. z who 's now in jail sent you a $ 1 k of his drug money however in this case i think it is more likely a scam and the scammer did n't really know what he was doing

form is to report to the irs withholding of capital gains tax that may be due from the seller foreign nationals do n't always file tax returns so they often did n't pay capital gains tax on properties that they sold congress decided to make the buyers responsible for this tax so that they would have a better chance of collecting it there is a penalty against the buyer if that tax is not withheld your attorney should have filed this form on your behalf as part of the closing papers i think your first step is to look at your copy of the closing papers and see if money was withheld from the sale there definitely should be disclosure of these requirements before the sale you should also follow up with your attorney to see whether he has already filed the forms and on your behalf if you had purchased for less than $ 300,000 and were purchasing for your primary residence you would not have to file that form but since the property was under $ 1,000,000 the withholding rate is only 10 rather than 15

excellent answers so far so i will just add one additional consideration liquidity money invested in a mutual fund exclusive of retirement accounts with early withdrawal penalties has a relatively high liquidity whereas excess equity in your home from paying down early has very low liquidity to put it simply if you get in a desperate situation long term unemployment it is better to have to cash in a mutual fund than try to sell your house on the quick and move in with your mother liquidity becomes less of an issue if you also manage to fund a decent sized rainy day fund 6 9 months of living expenses

first let 's look at the tax brackets for single taxpayers in 2016 the cutoff between the 25 and 28 tax bracket is $   you said that your gross is $   this will be reduced by deductions and exemptions at least $ 10,350   your rental income will increase your income but it is offset in part by your rental business expenses for this year you will almost certainly be in the 25 bracket whether or not you receive your this year   next year if you receive your then and your salary is $ 11k higher i 'm guessing you 'll be close to the edge it is important to remember that the tax brackets are marginal   this means that when you move up to the next tax bracket it is only the amount of income that puts you over the top that is taxed at the higher rate   you can see this in the chart above   so if for example your taxable income ends up being $ you 'll be in the 28 tax bracket but only $ 10 of your income will be taxed at 28   the rest will be taxed at 25 or lower   as a result this probably is n't worth worrying about too much a bit more explanation requested by the op here is how to understand the numbers in the tax bracket chart   let 's take a look at the second line $   the tax rate is explained as $ plus 15 of the amount over $ 9,275   the first $ 9,275 of your taxable income is taxed at a 10 rate   so if your total taxable income falls between $ and $ 37,650 the first $ 9,275 is taxed at 10 a tax of $ and the amount over $ 9,275 is taxed at 15   on each line of the chart the amount of tax from all the previous brackets is carried down so you do n't have to calculate it when i said that you have at least $ 10,350 in deductions and exemptions i got that number from the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount   for 2016 the standard deduction for single taxpayers is $ 6,300   if you itemize your deductions you might be able to deduct more   personal exemptions for 2016 are at $ 4,050 per person   that means you get to reduce your taxable income by $ 4,050 for each person in your household   since you are single with no dependents your standard deduction plus the personal exemption for yourself will result in a reduction of at least $ 10,350 on your taxable income

however what actually appears to happen is that the 100k is invested into the company to fund some growth plan so is it actually the case that e 's company is worth 400k only after the transaction is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash and would the other 300k be listed as an ip asset the investor gets 25 of the shares of the company and pays $ 100k for them so owner 's equity increases by $ 100k and the company gets $ 100k more in cash the $ 400k number is an implicit calculation if 25 of the company is worth $ 100k 100 of the company is worth $ 400k it 's not on the books the investor is just commenting that they feel that they are being over charged

i could be wrong but by acquisition all it does is kill competition that a company faces by killing competition is it explicitly implied that they reduce innovation within the company if they are n't faced against competition they are n't forced to compete and innovate but is this always the case is there any reason why these companies would invest in r&amp;d after their acquisitions also what would this mean for the consumer by acquisitions and reduced competitions we we as consumers have no choice but to pay up whatever they charge i wonder if governmental agencies would place a cap on the prices they charge

the us postal service to my recollection recommends only mailing cash or items with cash like characteristics using registered mail service registered mail is expensive and a pain in the butt for everyone as it requires an audit trail for each individual who touches the mailing   if you 're doing a lot of business and word gets out that you 're accepting cash payments via the mail you 'll probably attract unwanted attention from the tax authorities as well it 's fairly unusual

worth of electricity to generate   the cost of bitcoin always tracks the price of bitcoin    there is a fixed amount of bitcoin available to be mined every day   the cost to mine bitcoin rises because of competition they increase the difficulty of the problems to maintain a fixed supply of bitcoin   the electricity cost to mine bitcoin is directly related to the amount of miners which is directly related to the current cost of bitcoin more people want to mine when the price is high   if you really think about it what you are really saying is that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is the value of bitcoin its a completely circular mirage

this may be closed as not quite pf but really startup as it 's a business question   in general you should talk to a professional if you have this type of question specifics like this regarding your tax code i would expect that as a business you will use a proper paper trail to show that money say 1000 units of currency came in and 900 went out this is a service no goods involved the transaction nets you 100 and you track all of this in the end you have the gross profit and then business expenses the gross amount 1000 should not be the amount taxed only the final profit

let me provide a general answer that might be helpful to others without addressing those specific stocks dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company   a company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by dividend yield traps   if a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay   there are exceptions like what happened with bp but these exceptions are rare   just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future   if the company continues to pay a dividend in the future it may be at a significantly different amount some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends   these companies may have unusually high dividends but this is simply a result of the corporate structure     let me provide a quick example certain etfs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the etf there is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100 certainty   even large companies like general electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis   so to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following update in regards to one the first stock you mentioned this sentence from the companies of yahoo finance explains the unusually dividend the company has elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax if it distributes at least 90 of its reit taxable income to its share holders

no one can really answer this for you   it is a matter of personal preference and the details of your situation   there are some really smart people on here when placed in your exact situation would do completely different things   personal finance is overall personal if it was me i 'd never borrow money in retirement   if i had the cash i 'd use it to help fund the purchase   if i did n't i simply would n't   for me wealth retention in your case is surprisingly more about behavior than math even though i am a math guy   you are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events   in my opinion you are inviting tales of woe to be part of your future if you borrow others would disagree with me   they would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg   they may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum   here in the us the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate   to help with a down payment of 50 k you might have to pull out to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment the third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way   perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment   maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home   those are all viable options   perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home having said all that it really depends on your situation   say your sitting on 5 million in investments your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income and they are asking for a relatively small amount   then pull the money out and do n't be concerned   you nest egg will quickly recover the money

you are not wrong just about anything can be charged and paid off in 30 days with a sale of non liquid investments   so there are not any emergencies i can think of that require completely liquid funds cash for me the risks are more behavioral than financial i 'm not saying it 's a ridiculous stupid idea and these are all what that can be countered with discipline and wise decisions but having an emergency fund in cash certainly makes all of this simpler and reduces risk if you have investments that you would have no hesitation liquidating to cover an emergency then you can make it work   for most people the choice is either paying cash or charging it without having investment funds to pay it off and they 're back in the cycle of paying minimum payments for months and drowning in debt

the answer like many answers is it depends specifically it depends on the broker and the type of account you have with the broker most brokers will charge you once per transaction so a commission on the buy and a commission and sec fee in the us on the sale however if you place a good til canceled gtc order and it 's partially filled one day then partially filled another day you 'll be charged two commissions there are other brokers comes to mind that either have trading windows where you can make any number of trades within that window or that have a fixed monthly fee giving you any probably with some upper limit number of trades per month there are other brokers interactive brokers for example that charge you the standard commission on buy and another commission and fee on sell but can refund you some of that commission for making a market in the security and pay you to borrow the securities so the usual answer is two commissions but that 's not universal however while commissions are important with discount brokers you 'll find the percent you 're paying for commissions is minimal which losses due to slippage and poor execution can swamp

the technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative gdp growth as is the natural cycle the curve will at some point in the future maybe it 's tomorrow or 5 years from now but nobody knows for certain one also should n't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators for example there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the ted spread and the libor spread if you take a peek at the ted spread it tells a much different story the ted spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other a lower ted rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower which would be another bank   lastly you really ca n't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling even if we are on the of a recession here in the us nobody can tell the impact and depth of the recession in my opinion we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1 3 years outside of that your guess is as good as mine

the dividend tax credit is not applicable to foreign dividend income so you would be taxed fully on every dollar of that income when you sell a stock there will be a capital gain or capital loss depending on if it gained or lost value after accounting for the adjusted cost base you only pay income tax on half of the amount earned through capital gains and if you have losses you can use them to offset other investments that had capital gains or carry forward to offset gains in the future   the dividends from us stocks are subject to a 15 withholding tax that gets paid to the irs automatically when the dividends are issued if the stocks are held in an rrsp they are exempt from the withholding tax if held in a non registered account you can be reimbursed for the tax by claiming the foreign tax credit that you linked to if held in a tfsa or resp the withholding tax can not be recovered also if you are not directly holding the stocks and instead buy a mutual fund or etf that directly holds the stocks then the rrsp exemption no longer applies but the foreign tax credit is still for a non registered account if the mutual fund or etf does not directly hold stocks and instead holds one or more etfs there is no way to recover the withholding tax in any type of account

to begin with bear in mind that over the time horizon you are talking about the practical impact of inflation will be quite limited inflation for 2017 is forecast at 2.7 and since you are talking about a bit less than all of 2017 and on average you 'll be withdrawing your money halfway through the overall impact will be < 1.3 of your savings you should consider whether the effort and risk involved in an alternative is worth a few hundred pounds if you still want to beat inflation the best suggestion i have is to look at peer to peer lending that comes with some risk but i think over the course of 1 year it 's quite limited for example zopa is currently offering 3.1 on their access product and are offering 2.9 on the everyday product both of these are advertised as instant access albeit with some caveats these are n't fscs guaranteed bank deposits and they do come with some risk firstly although both and zopa have a significant level of provision against bad debt it 's always possible that this wo n't be enough and you 'll lose some of your money i think this is quite unlikely over a one year time horizon as there 's no sign of trouble yet secondly there 's liquidity risk although the products are advertised as instant access they are actually backed by longer duration loans made to people who want to borrow money for you to be able to cash out someone else has to be there ready to take your place again this is very likely to be possible in practice but there 's no absolute guarantee

hey currently in treasury it 's good in some ways and bad in others every role has it 's pluses and minuses   some basic thoughts are that you get to see a lot of the company you get a cursory view of what everyone is doing all the time but you do n't really ever get in depth views of any one area it 's a role that makes it easy to jump around industries because every large company has a treasury department but it limits the size of the company you can join because a lot of small companies wo n't have one or will just have a cash person and not an actual department you get to look at bond and commercial paper markets if that 's interesting to you you get a lot of interaction with higher ups because cash is hugely important you 're the first to know if the company is gon na go bankrupt it 's a good place to learn the business if you end up wanting to move but it 's a pretty specific skill set and carries a decent amount of responsibility it 's one of the only corporate finance roles that 's closer to front office than mid or back office   if you are just joining corporate treasury you 'll probably start out doing cash management and forecasting maybe doing short term liquidity and investment activity after that you would move into bond stuff management corporate finance stuff as opposed to the cash desk after that you 'd probably get to be involved in stuff like long term planning and m&amp;a activity which is the real cool shit    that 's what came off the top of my head do you have any specific questions

a credit default swap is a derivative a financial contract with a value dependent upon another asset a cds in essence is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default the typical arrangement is that a holder of non risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non risk free credit defaults banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors   banks will typically buy on mortgages and corporate bonds paying part of the income from interest payments received to have the right to force counterparties typically hedge funds and insurance companies to swap national treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default   the banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers households and corporations hedge funds typically take on more complex arrangements while insurance companies sell because they are usually overflowing with risk free assets yet are starved for income

the roth vs not debate is irrelevant to the question it does n't matter where your emergency fund is kept as long as it is liquid and safe i said it before in an answer to another question your emergency fund is not an investment it 's your safety net this answer also says it well an emergency fund is just that for emergencies not investment while it hurts not to have your emergency money making more money its more important to have quick access to it so at td ameritrade just park it in their fdic deposit account it will not earn any meaningful interest at least until rates rise but you 'll be able to have access to it when you need it note that i would caution against putting it in a money market mutual fund they 're safer than many other investments but they 're not fdic insured against loss and there is a potential for temporary loss of liquidity in late 2008 when the credit markets collapsed a lot of people suddenly became unemployed and needed access to their emergency funds when lehman brothers went bust in september the reserve primary fund with billions of dollars in their fund broke the buck they lowered the price of shares below $ 1 meaning investors lost principal the worst part is that investors were not as liquid as they wanted to be the fund froze and it was hard to get money out the lesson to take away from this is that one of the times you 're likely to need access to your emergency fund is during a macroeconomic crisis this is also the time when any investment that is n't guaranteed safe may potentially be at least temporarily unavailable or decline in value emergency funds should be 100 government insured when you have your roth funded to the point where there 's extra money beyond the emergency fund you can start investing in higher yielding vehicles stock or bond index etfs would be a good start but then that part of your roth starts to look like a retirement account and not an emergency fund if it were me i 'd open a roth at a stable local bank and just keep it in their fdic insured money market deposit account then if i wanted a slight boost i might put the upper half of my emergency fund into short term cds but even cds are n't worth much at the moment

primarily because they do n't want big price movements when they are in the market if they the markets either they have to buy at a higher price or they sell at a lower price or they decrease the price of their is n't always a big factor the 3 situations they did n't want to be in the first place and the most important thing is most analysts are dumb whom you should ignore they tout because they want to increase their exposure in your eyes so that they may land a job in one of those big investment companies or they might be holding stocks and want to profit from it frankly speaking if you take advice from the so called analysts be prepared to say goodbye to your money some day may n't be always one near case maybe carson block from muddy waters but he does his homework properly

the most common use of non deductible traditional ira contributions these days as joetaxpayer mentioned is as an intermediate step in a backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira and then immediately convert it to a roth ira which if you had no previous pre tax money in traditional or other iras is a tax free process that achieves the same result as a regular roth ira contribution except that there are no income limits this is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a roth ira due to income limits also i want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax efficient assets ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out if you are holding tax inefficient assets like an interest bearing cd or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings and that would be much worse than with the non deductible traditional ira where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out

what you 're looking for are either fx forwards or fx futures    these products are traded differently but they are basically the same thing agreements to deliver currency at a defined exchange rate at a future time    almost every large venue or bank will transact forwards when the counterparty you or your broker has sufficient trust and credit for the settlement risk but the typical duration is less than a year though some will do a single digit multi year forward on a custom basis   then again all forwards are considered custom contracts   you 'll also need to know that forwards are done on currency pairs so you 'll need to pick the currency to pair your nok against   most likely you 'll want eur nok simply for the larger liquidity of that pair over other possible pairs a quote on a forward will usually just be known by the standard currency pair ticker with a settlement date different from spot   e.g. eur nok 12 m for the 12 month settlement futures on the other hand are exchange traded and more standardized   the vast majority through the cme chicago mercantile exchange   your broker will need access to one of these exchanges and you simply need to qualify for futures trading process depends on your broker   futures generally have highest liquidity for the next expiration quarterly expiration on well known standard dates but i believe they 're defined for more years out than forwards    at one fx desk i 've knowledge of they had 6 years worth of quarterly expirations in their system at any one time   futures are generally known by a ticker composed of a globex or cme code for the currency with another code representing the expiration   for example is nok for norwegian h for march and 6 for the nearest future date 's year that ends in 6 i.e. 2016    note that you 'll be legally liable to deliver the contracted size of if you hold through expiration   so the common trade is to hold the future and net out just before expiration when the price more accurately reflects the current spot market

nobody here really answered your question   the custodian of the 401k determines what funds and investment options are available within that 401k   so if they 're eliminating company stock as an option then they can absolutely make you sell out of it     you may be able to do an in service rollover and transfer your funds to an individual ira but that 's not particularly common among 401k administrators    aside from that i 'd ask why do you want to hold company stock anyway   generally i 'd advise against this as its imposing a ton of risk on your financial future   if your company tanks you 're out of a job which sucks   but it sucks even more if your company tanks and your 401k loses a ton of value at the same time    edit i see you asked who benefits as well   it may just be a situation of no benefit at all   perhaps the plan did n't have enough people investing in company stock to make the option cost effective   maybe the administrator decided that allowing people to take on that amount of risk was not in their best 's not   could be a ton of reasons but it 's unlikely the company did so out of greed   there is n't a lot of financial benefit for them there

the bottom line is that you are kind of a terrible customer for them    granted you are far better than one that does not pay his bills but you are probably in the tier right above that rewards cards are used to lure the unorganized into out of control interest rates and late payments   these people are capital one 's and others best customers   they have traded hundreds of dollars in interest payments for a couple of dollars in rewards   the cc company says   you on the other hand cut into their meager profits from fees collected from your transactions   why should they help you make more money   why should they further cut into your profits response to comment given your comment i think the bottom line is a matter of perspective   you seem like a logical altruistic type person who probably seeks a win win situation in business dealings   this differs from cc companies they operate to seek one thing   btw the terrible customer remark should be taken as a compliment    after you get past the marketing lies you begin to see what reward programs and zero percent financing is all about   how do most people end up with interest rates   they started with a zero percent balance loan and was late for a payment reward cards work a bit differently   studies show that people tend to spend about 17 more when they use a reward card   i 've caught myself ordering an extra or beer and have subsequently stopped using a reward card for things i can make a decision at the time of purchase   for people with tight budgets this leads to debt my meager profits paragraph makes sense when you understand the onerous nature of cc companies   they are not interested in earning 2 on purchases charge 3 and give back 1 for basically free money   you rightly see this as what should be a win win for all parties involved   thus the meager in quotation marks   cc companies are willing to give back 1 and charge 3 if you then pay 15 or more on your balance some may disagree with me on the extracting nature of cc companies but they are wrong   i like him as an actor but i do n't believe samuel jackson 's lines

hi u   short answer yes you do have to pay taxes in israel for all your   long answer all countries within the consider you as a fiscal resident in the country where you spend over half a year in 183 days and up if you do not spend that much time in any country there are other tying measures to avoid people not being fiscal residents in any country   since you are living in israel you will have to pay all your generated income in israel following the tax regulation that is in place there i am no tax lawyer so i can not help you there   having a lot of business internationally brings other headaches with it taking for example the u.s. there is a possibility that they taxes in their payments it is unlikely though as they have a tax treaty to prevent double taxation you can ask for this money to be returned from the u.s. or other countries through each country 's internal process   another thing to take into account is that you can be taxed in other countries for any revenue you generate in said country this is especially relevant for revenue that comes from real estate the country where the real estate is will tax you in the country and you will have to deduct these taxes paid in your country israel in this case if there is no tax treaty you might possibly be paying twice   i know you said you do promotion but i have to warn you about this because i ignore what other countries tax or do not tax so been giving more info wo n't hurt   if the us is the main and/or only country you will be doing business with i strongly recommend you real the tax treaty with lots of love and patience you can find it here or here   treaty amendment   if you are from israel and prefer it in here are the treaties in your language   treaty amendment    normally most irs departments have sections with very help on these sort of matters i 'd you to take a look at yours    last what i 've explained is the normal process that applies almost all over the world but each country has their own distinctions and you need to look carefully take what i said as a starting point and do your own research or ideally try to find a tax consultant lawyer who helps you   best of luck

i would suggest both as an investor and as someone who has some experience with a family run trust not my own that this is probably not something you should get involved with unless the money is money you 're not worried about money that otherwise would turn into trips to the movies or something like that   if you 're willing to treat it as such then i 'd say go for it first off this is not a short or medium term investment   this sort of thing will not be profitable right away and it will take quite a few years to become profitable to the point that you could take money out of it if ever   your money will be effectively if not actually locked up for years and be nearly entirely illiquid second it 's not necessarily a good investment even considering that   real estate is something people tend to feel like it should be an amazing investment that just makes you money and is better than risky things like the stock market except it 's really not   it 's quite risky vulnerable to things like the 2008 crash but also to things like a local market being a bit down or having several months with no renter    the amount your fund will have in it at most $ wo n't be enough to buy even one property for years $ 1500/month means you 're looking at what 100 150 months before you have enough and as such wo n't have enough to buy multiple properties for even longer which is where you reach some stability   having a washing machine break down or a roof leak is a big deal when you only have one property to manage having five or six properties spreads out the risk significantly you wo n't get tax breaks from this of course and that 's where the real issue is for you   you would be far better off putting your money in a roth ira or a regular ira but based on your career choice and current income i 'd strongly consider a roth   you 'll get tax free growth less risky than this fund and probably faster growing but regardless of both of those tax free   that 15 25 that uncle sam is giving you back is a huge huge deal greater than any return a fund is going to give you and if they promise that high run far and fast finally as someone who 's watched a family trust work at managing itself it 's a huge huge headache and not something i 'd recommend at least unless it comes with money in which case it 's of course a different story   you wo n't agree on investments inevitably and you 'll end up spending huge amounts of time trying to convince each other to go with your idea and it will likely end up being fairly stagnant and conservative because that 's what everyone will be able to at least not object to it might be something you all enjoy doing in which case good luck but definitely not my cup of tea

i wo n't make any assumptions about the source of the money   typically however this can be an emotional time and the most important thing to do is not act if this is an amount of money you have never seen before getting advice from a fee only financial adviser would be my second step   the first step is to breathe and promise yourself you will not make any decisions about this money in the short term   better to have $ 100 k in the bank earning nearly zero interest than to spend it in the wrong way if you have to receive the money before you can meet with an adviser then just open a new savings account at your bank or credit union and put the money in there   it will be safe and sound visit and interview at least three advisers with their guidance think about what your goals are   do you want to invest and grow the money   pay off debt   own a home or new large purchase   these are personal decisions but the adviser might help you think of goals you did n't imagine create a plan and execute it

whether you do decide to go with a tax advisor or not be sure to do some research on your own when we moved to the us about 5 years ago i did find the taxes here pretty complicated and confusing   i went ahead and read up all different tax documents and did some calculations of my own before hiring a cpa at that point i just wanted a second opinion to make sure i got the calculations right however when the office of the cpa was finished with my taxes i found they had made a mistake when i went back to their office to point it out the lady just shrugged corrected her numbers on the form and said you seem to know a lot about this stuff already why are you here i swore to never use them again not this particular cpa at least now i am not saying all cpas are the same some of them are pretty darn good at their job and know what they are doing all i am saying is it helps to be prepared and know some basic stuff just do n't go in all blind   after all they are also humans prone to mistakes and your taxes are your liability in the end   my suggestion is to start with a good tool that supports tax filing for non residents most of them provide a step by step qa based tool as you go through the steps google each question you do n't understand it may take more time than hiring a tax advisor directly but in the end it will all be worth it

lets consider what would happen if you invested $ plus $ 10k down in a property or did the same in a low cost index fund over the 30 year term that most mortgages take   the returns of either scenarios can not be guaranteed but there are long term analyses that shows the stock market can be expected to return about 7 compounded yearly this does n't mean each year will return 7 some years will be negative and some will be much higher but that over a long span the average will reach 7   using a time value of money calculator that down payment monthly additions of $ 1,500 and a 7 annual return would be worth about $ 1.8 m in 30 years if 1.8 m were invested you could safely withdraw $ for the rest of your life do consider of inflation makes this less than today 's dollar   there are long term analyses that show real estate more or less keeps track with inflation at 2 4 annual returns this does n't consider real estate taxes maintenance insurance and the very individual and localized issues with your market and your particular house is land limited where you are increasing your price will new development drive down your price   in 30 years you 'll own the house outright you 'll still need to pay property tax and insurance on it and you 'll be getting rental income over those 30 years you can expect to replace a roof 2 3 hot water heaters concrete work several trees decades of snow shoveling mowing grass and weeding your hvac system windows and doors and probably a kitchen and bathroom you will have paid about 1.5x the initial price of the mortgage in interest along the way   so you 'll have whatever the rental price for your house monthly probably almost impossible to predict for a single family home plus the market price of your house again very difficult to predict but could safely say it keeps pace with inflation minus your expenses   there are scenarios where you could beat the stock market there are ways to reduce the lifestyle burden of being a landlord   along the way should you want to purchase a house for yourself to live in you 'll have to prove the rental income is steady to qualify for a loan having equity in a mortgage gives you something to borrow against in a heloc of course you could easily end up owing more than your house is worth in that situation   personally i 'd stick to investing that money in low fee index funds

since you have presumably now been living here for six months you may already have discovered that australian banks charge a transaction fee whether the funds are deposited from overseas by check cheque or i have an account with bank of america and used to be able to draw funds from australian bank westpac via their atms without incurring a fee because bofa and westpac are both members of a global atm alliance that did not charge fees to each others customers but now they have initiated a new policy and take 3 of every sum withdrawn not quite usury but in the same ballpark i 'm now investigating the possibility of opening a schwab or a capital one account in the us and using one of their credit cards which i believe would allow withdrawals at australian atms for no fee if you find or have found a good answer to your dilemma i hope you will share it

you 're confused because the source you cite leaves out one number that is n't relevant to the argument they 're making total costs the number you 're expecting $ 9 x 365 or $ is the total cost of buying the jewelry which when subtracted from the $ sales volume gives us the net profit of $ 365   the investment is the amount of money original put into a system our company in this case the merchant bought his first piece of jewelry for $ 9 sold it for $ 10 took one dollar in profit and used the other 9 to reinvest by buying a new piece of jewelry we can extend the analogy further after 9 days of selling the merchant will $ 18 allowing him to now buy 2 pieces of jewelry each morning and sell them for $ 20 every day his costs will be $ 18 and he 'll turn a $ 2 profit all with the original investment of $ 9

to understand the vxx etf you need to understand vix futures to understand vix futures you need to understand vix to understand vix you need to understand options pricing formulas such as the black scholes formula those are your learn at your own pace short answer when you buy vxx you are buying the underlying are front month vix futures limited by the supply of the etf 's nav net asset value units it is assumed that the etf manager is actually buying and selling more vix front month futures to back the underlying etf long answer assume nobody knows what an options contract should be worth therefore formulas have been devised to standardize how to price an options contract the black scholes formula is widely used one of the variables in this formula is implied volatility which basically accounts for the mispricing of options when the other variables intrinsic value delta gamma theta do n't completely explain how much the option is worth people are willing to pay more for options when the perception is that they will be more profitable implied volatility tracks these changes in an option 's demand where the rest of the black scholes formula creates a price for an option that will always be the same each stock in the market that also trades standardized options will have implied volatility which can be computed from the price of those options the volatility index vix looks at the implied volatility of many stock 's options contracts specifically the implied volatility of out the money puts on the s&p 500 if you do n't know what that quoted part of the sentence means then you have at least five other individual questions to ask before you re read this answer and understand the relevance of these followup questions why would people buy out the money puts on the s&p 500 why would people pay more for out the money puts on the s&p 500 on some days and pay less for them on other days this is really the key to the whole puzzle anyway now that we have this data people wanted to speculate on the future value of the vix so vix futures contracts began trading and with it there came a liquid market there does n't need to be anything physical to back a financial product anymore a lot of people do n't trade futures retail investors have practically only heard of the stock market so one investment bank decided to make a fund that only holds vix futures that expire within a month front month futures they split that fund up into shares and listed it on the stock market like the vxx was formed volatility studies are fascinating and get way more complex than this now that the vxx etf also has liquid options contracts trading on it too and there are leveraged vix etf funds that also trade options

gt;the cycle has really up it used to be you could buy a fighter jet or a transport and use it for 25 years before worrying about replacing it with the latest and greatest now the latest and greatest are still on the ground before they 're obsolete   i disagree with that think it 's the other way around the f-35 for example is currently programmed to continue flying until with each jet lasting years or without any life extensions the was also and is good for over 12,000 flight hours and will serve at least into the previous jets were generally only built to originally last 4000 or 6000 flight hours equating to 15 or 20 years of use they 've since had to receive service life extensions as the cold war ended and a bunch of their replacements failed to or were delayed the was cancelled because it was n't as as planned and was massively overweight the was delayed and had its production run cut short the f-35 was also delayed but has yet to be cut back   op 's title is unsurprisingly considering it 's russian state media incorrect out of the current 250 or so f-35s about 108 need upgrades to bring them to their final setup the pentagon is considering not giving them upgrades not due to cost it 's only a few million per jet on average way cheaper than buying 108 new jets but because the and factories that would perform the upgrades are at near capacity pumping out new jets   if the pentagon decides not to upgrade those jets like it decided not to for early f-16s f etc then they 'll largely be staying where they are continuing to be training or test aircraft the jets in the actual combat ready are already upgraded at no point have pentagon officials suggested actually retiring them

the of the deduction is based on what the borrowed money is used to purchase and not what asset is used as collateral   so at the beginning of your mortgage 10 of the interest is deductible because the entire loan was used to purchase the condo   but when you withdraw money from the account the additional interest is usually not deductible   it can get confusing with all the withdrawals and payments that will be coming in and out of the account if you happen to use it a lot like a chequing account an easy example would be if you only paid the interest on the loan   say you had a $ 100 000 loan at 5 apy for simplicity 's sake   after one year you would have paid $ 5000 interest   $ 500 of the would be deductible given that your office is 10 of the condo   then you buy a $ 1000 couch and continue to only pay interest for the next year   you would have paid $ interest   $ 5000 on money borrowed to buy the condo and $ 100 on money borrowed to buy the couch   so you can still only deduct $ 500 what happens when you pay back $ 500 against the line of credit   could you designate that 100 of the money should be applied to the non deductible interest   or does it have to applied proportionally   i do n't know i think it 'd would be wise to separate the loans somehow   may even have some tools to facilitate that   however i would n't recommend the one product   i looked into when i was buying my house two years ago and at that time it was too expensive   the rate was the same that other banks were charging for a home equity line of credit which was prime at the time   you can replicate the one in a cheaper way using a traditional mortgage and a home equity line of credit   the majority of the loan will be the traditional mortgage at hopefully a cheap rate   then you can use your line of credit as the chequing account

the pots will be negligible however this capital could be used better elsewhere if i was to withdraw them you wo n't be able to withdraw the money notwithstanding the recent pension freedom changes money put into a pension is still inaccessible until age 55 at the very earliest and probably later by the time you get there you should have been advised of this every time you enrolled into a scheme although it may well have been buried in something you were given to read the best you can do and what i would recommend although of course this post is n't advice is to transfer the pensions to a personal pension for example a sipp wherein you will be able to control where the money is invested most sipp providers will gladly help you with such transfers would it be beneficial to keep these smaller pots with their respected schemes the reason i suggest transferring is that leaving the funds in workplace schemes that are no longer being contributed to is a way of finding yourself invested in poorly performing neglected funds earning money for no one beyond the scheme provider

if your spouse wishes to buy a car and finance it with a car loan they are free to do so once they have bought a car they are free to let you use it however if you are the owner of the car the loan is going to have to be in your name your spouse ca n't get a loan backed by an asset they do n't own they could get a personal loan and then give the money to you but the interest rates would likely be rather high also even if you are n't on any of the paperwork you being married likely will affect the situation it will depend on what state you 're in if you want to go that route one of the best ways to find out is to simply have your spouse ask the people that would be providing the loan can i finance this separate from my spouse or will they be included in the credit evaluation

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

here is a quick and dirty explanation of options in a nutshell you pay a certain amount to buy a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price at some date in the future they come in a few flavors   i 'll give you $ 100 if you let me buy 10,000 shares of xyz for $ 10 more    per share than it is trading at today any time before    august 10th i 'll give you $ 100 if you promise to buy 10,000 shares of xyz from me    for $ 10 less per share than it is trading at today if i ask before august 10th there are also two main types based on the expiration behavior   there are lots of strategies that employ options too many to go into   two key uses are leverage buying call options can give you a much higher return on your investment than just investing in the actual stock however with much higher risk of losing all of your investment instead of just some of it when the stock drops hedging if you already own the underlying stock put options can be used to buy down risk of serious drops in a holding

the benefit of having gold to trade is that there is almost always someone that will take gold when the fiat currency is in trouble     the potential downfall of doing this is that when people think the fiat currency is in trouble they tend to buy up gold thus driving up the price   this means that you get less gold for each hour of work you perform deer basket of apples etc     even more if the financial crisis is limited to only one fiat currency you have a situation where that fiat currency devalues but others can gain in value as people try to sell their old currency for the new standard currency   if people also sell their gold to buy up this currency that lowers the price of gold in that currency     for example let us assume that gold was 1000 dollars an ounce and 1000 euros an ounce   suddenly people start thinking that the euro is in trouble so they start buying gold   the law of supply and demand kicks in more buyers same supply so higher prices and gold is suddenly worth 2000 dollars and 2000 euros an ounce   if you start buying at this point you get half as much gold as the person who bought in the beginning   suddenly the euro collapses   stores that used to take euros start demanding dollars   suddenly it costs 20,000 euros for an ounce of gold but an ounce of gold will only get you 1,000 dollars since everyone is selling their gold to get dollars     the people who buy gold in the panic end up losing half the value of their money if not more   the speculators that bought gold at $ 1,000 sold it at $ 2,000 and bought it back at $ 1,000 now have all their gold back plus the $ 1,000 the other people lost

your score is real time updating every time new data hits the reporting agencies dilip is correct go over 20 and it will hit the report but then the score returns to normal after the next bill shows a utilization   say your average spending is $ 1000 but your limit is $ 5000 there 's no harm in asking for a small increase in the limit or simply pay a bit toward the bill before the statement is cut the bill and reported balance will be lower and your score unaffected

a few years ago i had a 5 year car loan i wanted to prepay it after 2 years and i asked this question to the lender i expected a reduction in the interest attached to the car loan since it did n't go the full 5 years they basically told me i was crazy and the balance owed was the full amount of the 5 year car loan this sounds like you either got a bad car loan i.e. pay all the interest first before paying any principal a crooked lender or you were misunderstood   most consumer loans both car loans and mortgages reduce the amount of interest you pay not the percentage as you pay down principal the amount of interest of each payment is computed by multiplying the balance owed by the periodic interest rate e.g. if your loan is at 12 annual interest you 'll pay 1 of the remaining principal each month although that 's the most common loan structure there are others that are more complex and less friendly to the consumer typically those are used when credit is an issue and the lender wants to make sure they get as much interest up front as they can and can recover the principal through a repossession or foreclosure it sounds like you got a interest loan   with these loans the amount of interest you 'd pay if you paid through the life of the loan is computed and added to the principal to get a total loan balance you are required to pay back that entire amount regardless of whether you pay early or not you could still pay it early just to get that monkey off your back but you may not save any interest    you are not crazy to think that you should be able to save on interest though as that 's how normal loans work    next time you need to borrow money make sure you understand the terms of the loan and if you do n't ask someone else to help you or just save up cash and do n't borrow money

your rate of return for paying off this loan is 9 and that 's guaranteed for reference the best rate of return on a 10-year fdic insured certificate of deposit today is 3 there 's definitely something out there with better returns than paying off your loans but there 's definitely not going to be anything with better risk adjusted returns than paying off your loans investors dream of guaranteed 9 rates of return if you had something that could provide a guaranteed 9 rate of return wannabe investors would be lining up at your door and tripping over each other to outbid each other until it actually closer to a 3 rate of return :p depending on whether your loans are tax deductible and what your inflation expectations are you could adjust those rates to make the comparison more accurate but at 3 vs 9 the picture 's pretty clear

the focus of this article is n't on tax revenue the author is discussing income disparity    the laffer curve does n't tell the whole story you are correct a higher tax rate does not imply higher tax revenue and a lower tax rate does not imply less revenue changing tax rates is n't going to significantly affect tax revenue however there are a broad range of other effects when changing tax rates in evaluating adjustments to tax rates our focus needs to be on these secondary effects    we are taxed on income not   when i sell you a $ 10 widget that i paid a worker $ 2 to produce from $ 5 of materials i pay taxes on the $ 3 net income not the $ 10 revenue i received from you     the main way businesses avoid high marginal tax rates is by increasing deductible expenses such that their net income after these expenses keeps them below their desired tax bracket   it is far better to spend that money on something that can benefit the business than simply give it to the government any businessman would rather keep his earnings if possible if that is not possible he 'd prefer to spend them on something that can help him rather than squandering it on junk or giving it away to the government    for most businesses the largest deductible expense is payroll any decent employer would prefer to pay out a christmas bonus instead of giving that same amount to uncle sam any businessman would prefer to pay for additional advertising or a charitable donation to a worthy cause rather than paying the irs    run up the top tier tax rate and suddenly businessmen feel a compelling need to lower their prices and pay their workers more run up the tax rate and income disparity shrinks   run up the tax rate and you put more money in the hands of consumers

when purchasing a condo in a university town it is almost guaranteed that the prices will be inflated as a result   this is because you are competing not only with single home primary residence homeowners but also with a multitude of investment buyers and landlords who want to purchase a rental property   universities are popular rental markets due to their stability there will always be students looking for a place to live and as a result the areas attract investors more than other markets this can work in your favor however   if you do n't mind sharing your residence with other students and you do n't mind the part time work that being a landlord requires you can live much cheaper and even make money over the next few years as your roommates pay your bills   owning a primary residence rental property also brings a lot of tax benefits because you can claim expenses and depreciation against your income   this could benefit your father who could be a co owner and would certainly benefit from the write offs against his higher tax bracket the real trick that makes or breaks the experience is finding mature responsible roommates who will cause the minimum amount of headache   if this part of the equation is missing it can lead to distractions from school and even legal worries when you have to think about things like unpaid rent and/or

this is why minimum wage has not gone up   its a fallacy way of thinking   your business will be required to do one of 4 things   raise prices fire employees remove pointless expenses or you take a hit   more than likely you will attempt to do situation 1 because you need all your employees you currently have   if you could work with less employees as a business owner you would of already had done that   the next part is you will find things that are pointless   why are you paying for a certain type of yeast when you found out you can get the same type from someone else cheaper   finally you may have to take the hit to yourself   the market will balance itself out   however this is the big part people do nt understand   the larger companies like to dick people over as much as possible   you think walmart which already uses illegal workers on their farms has everything made in china is going to raise prices the exact same amount   of course not   they will raise prices but nothing like that and the only people who will be hurt is the companies profit sheets and the ceo pay   that is nothing that will ruin a company   furthermore that person who was making around 7 dollars an hour will have a higher income to spend and instead of purchasing crap bread from walmart they will now splurge sometimes and purchase higher end bread from such as yourself   i think people do nt understand that companies will do and always done everything they can to save money   walmart will have no choice but to either raise prices or not make as large of a profit as they once made   the company wo nt fail the economy will also continue but the wealth is now going to spread out more   i wish i could make more people understand this but alas they will believe that you ca nt raise prices because it will ruin the economy   what s ruining the economy is actually letting the min wage stay so low   it basically turns most people into indentured servants because they can barely afford to live   does that make sense

allen welcome to money se you 've stumbled into the issue of debt snowball which is the low balance method of paying off debt the other being high interest i absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards say a dozen there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card i am not dismissive of that motivation personal finance has that first word personal and one size rarely fits all for those who are numbers oriented it 's worth doing the math a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the ds vs paying by rate   if that cost is even a couple hundred dollars i 'll still concede that one less payment envelope stamp etc favors the ds method on the other hand there 's the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away during that time $ 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you $ vs the $ 500 if paid toward 5 debt hard core do n't even want to discuss the numbers strangely enough   in your case you do n't have a pile of anything the mortgage is n't even up for discussion you have just 2 car loans send the $ 11,000 to the $ 19 k loan carrying the 2.5 this will save you $ 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down once you 've done that the remaining $ 8000 will become your lowest balance and you should flip to the debt snowball method which will keep you paying that debt off   ds is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses the radio audience that the david dave ramsey radio show host appeals to they may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt and have greatest success using this method but you exhibit none of their symptoms and are best served by the math by bringing up the topic here you 've found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding and finds his cousin offering to take him to an aa meeting the next day   in past articles on this decision i 've referenced a spreadsheet one can download it offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc for the situation described here the low balance total interest is $ vs $ for the higher interest not quite the $ 500 difference i estimated the $ 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs in my opinion knowledge is power and you can decide either way what 's important is that if you pay off the zero interest first you can say i knew it was a $ 350 difference but i 'd rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time my issue with ds is when it 's like a religion and followers are told to not even run the numbers i wrote an article thinking about dave ramsey a number of years back but the topic never gets old

i was in that same situation years ago with my parents one way she could apply for a loan in her name without her parents is if she is not currently living with them she should n't need them to cosign if she does n't have bad credit but if she is n't living with them and they are n't financing her room and board they ca n't claim her as a dependent so if she really wants to stick it to them she can go and try to politely explain how the loans work and tell them if they do n't cosign for her then she will apply on her own which she can only do while not living with them i believe but not sure and they will have to stop claiming her as a dependent on their taxes if they do n't agree she can put her foot down and force them to stop claiming her and tell them she will file her own application anyway and if they continue claiming her and get in trouble for it it 's their own fault cause she warned them to stop first they may agree to cosign rather than lose her as a dependent if it makes that big of a difference on their taxes if they do n't then she can forcefully punish them financially and their taxes will go up those were my choices when my parents refused to cosign for me to live at school but that was back in 1999 2000 and things may have changed since then things also change state by state and i live in pa

a indexed guaranteed income certificate market growth gic fits the criteria defined in the op the guaranteed part of the name means that if the market falls your capital is guaranteed they cover the loss and return all your capital to you and the index linked or market growth means that instead of the roi being fixed determined when you buy the gic the roi depends on is linked to the market growth e.g. an index so you get a fraction of profit which you share with the fund manager the upside is that you ca n't lose lose capital the fund manager does n't just share the losses with you they take cover all the losses the downside is that you only make a fraction of whatever profit you might make by investing directly in the market e.g. in an index fund another caveat is that you buy a gic over some fixed term e.g. you have to give them you money for a year or more two years

your plan sounds quite sound to me   i think that between the choices of $ 800 for loans $ 300 for retirement and $ 1100 for loans both are good choices and you are n't going to go wrong either way    some of the factors you might want to consider i like your retirement savings choices i myself use the admiral version of voo plus a slightly specialized but still large etf that allows me to do a bit of shifting   having something that 's at least a bit counter market can be helpful for balancing so something that will be going up some when the market overall is down some i would n't necessarily do bonds at your age but international markets are good for that or a stock etf that 's more stable than the overall market   if you 're using vanguard look at the minimums for buying admiral shares usually a few grand and aim to get those if possible as they have significantly lower fees though voo seems to pretty much tie the admiral version vfiax so in that case it may not matter so much as far as the target retirement funds you can certainly do those but i prefer not to they have somewhat higher though for vanguard not crazy high expense ratios   realistically you can do the same yourself quite easily

quite a lot changed since back then so i consider it highly unlikely that you could point to one single cause you can think about it more clearly when you remove money from the equation know that money is only an intermediary in the exchange of goods and it is in fact the exchanged goods that matter so to your question you produce some goods and exchange them for the goods you consume the amount of goods that you can exchange what you produced for determines your quality of life so what parts could change   1 you could actually produce less the increase in productivity is really hard to accurately measure because even if you know for a fact that one worker 's increased when buying a machine maybe that comes at a cost of less productivity in other areas   2 not everything that you pay for does actually increase your quality of life for example speeding tickets do n't other stuff might increase your quality of life but in a manner that you do n't easily recognize for example more prisoners that you pay for might reduce your chance of being mugged however if you 're not being mugged on a regular basis you would n't notice   3 other people get a higher percentage most countries tax rates rise with rising income so when the currency is being devalued tax rates rise relative to your purchasing power in addition to other taxes and fees that might be introduced or increased but even without government your bosses might simply take a bigger cut of the company 's earnings   4 we might produce the wrong stuff if more stuff gets produced that you do not want the production of the stuff you do want will decline even if total productivity is increased   and that is only what i can think of from the top of my head you will probably find that all of those happen and most likely other causes as well

i have a similar plan and a similar number of accounts    i think seeking a target asset allocation mix across all investment accounts is an excellent idea i use excel to track where i am and then use it to adjust to get closer but not exactly to my target percentages until you have some larger balances it may be prudent to use less categories or realize that you ca n't come exactly to your percentages but can get close    i also simplify by primarily investing in various index funds   that means that in my portfolio each category has 1 or 2 funds not 10 or 20

he offered a 15 stake   he showed willingness to move from his original position by moving to 20   this left the door open for further discussions but if the last shark was n't offering royalties or something else to sweeten the pot he was n't going to budge much more than maybe to 22.5   you give away too much too easily and a seasoned negotiator smells blood and goes for it   every round of negotiations needs to offer a bit more but less than the additional offered in the previous round and not without receiving something in return so after increasing by 5 to 20 he would not have added another 35 based on their arguments he would reason why an additional 2.5 would be the most he could offer without additional consideration if he jumped from 15 to say 40 too easily the other negotiator would be looking for an additional 20 after that   so he went from 15 to 20 in response to the 75 equity stake and did nothing to seem or unreasonable while setting the tone for the next and last negotiator   the last guy was n't willing to walk away and showed that he was n't going to be pushed into a bad deal so a deal got done   dunno if that makes sense but his assertions coupled with strong but fair negotiating skills and a product that at least one person saw value in or any negotiation would be pointless won the day

that does n't mean this is a bad decision for toyota which you seem to be implying    could do certain processes better than toyota and vice versa so they can combine their capabilities   is n't a small company so the capacity and/or money spent on a new plant is still more with mazda in the pic   to give an example to your point directly if toyota made it alone let 's say they projected they get 1b profit year   if mazda made it alone they project 100 m profit    with the combined capabilities of mazda and toyota let 's say the plant is projected to make year then if the deal is toyota keeps 1.2 and mazda gets 0.3 then both parties benefit despite the fact that toyota could make the plant itself    mutually beneficial unless these guys are just making dumb business decisions

they help fund road projects that would otherwise require an increase in the fuel tax a large enough project like a new limited access will cost hundreds of millions to construct so they float some bonds that will be paid off with toll revenue lots of times after the bonds have been paid off the state has the options to remove the toll and put the road back   in the pool with all the other roads of course governments very rarely voluntarily a revenue stream   for example here in georgia we only have one toll road wiki in atlanta despite having 10 million residents how do you justify increasing fuel taxes on residents hundreds of miles away on the coast for a transportation project that only benefits atlanta commuters you can not thus tolls

generally speaking no person or program is really going to be able to help you lower your current tax burden most tax decisions are done well before you reach the tax time you either qualify for the deduction credit or your do n't where a good accountant will really be able to help you out is in planning that will limit your future tax burden particularly if you run a small business or are very wealthy you will probably want to consider using an accountant i would always avoid the large scale tax prep places like hr block they provide the same or lower quality service for a higher price than the software i run a small business and do my own taxes using turbo tax but my business is n't overly complex sole prop no employees couple 1099 's simple expenses nothing to amortize etc

this question is very open ended but i 'll try to answer parts of it an employer can offer shares as part of a compensation package instead of paying cash the employer can use the money to buy up shares and give them to the employees this is done to keep employees for longer periods of time and the employer may also want to create more insider ownership for a number of reasons another possibility is issuance of secondary offerings that are partially given to employees secondary offerings often lower the price of the shares in the market and create an incentive for employees to stay until the stock price rises all of these conditions can be stipulated look up golden handcuffs usually stock gifts are only given to a few high level employees and as part of a bonus package it is very unusual to see a mature company regularly give away large amounts of stock as this is a frowned upon practice start ups often pay their employees with stock up until the company is acquired or goes public

i feel the same way too   with two kids i feel like i am spending what it would cost to run a small country just on clothes shoes jackets replacing everything as it is grown out of a few things i do   i shop in affordable places and check out sales and look for the things i can find there in a reasonable price range   if you are n't browsing in the $ 60 baby you are n't tempted by them   i do n't go looking at $ 60 shirts for my son he 's five and he does n't need a $ 60 shirt   i also really only shop for him two or three times a year for clothing back to school and early spring are the big ones   for fall i got him five pairs of jeans maybe 8 tops new socks etc   i 'll add in a couple of heavier etc as i go but i really do n't browse for him it 's too easy to find something to buy i look for inexpensive lines for the things that do n't really matter bright t 's for my son for summer that just get dirty and spilled on socks 's etc   joe fresh walmart old navy costco   then i choose a few things that i know i want brand name or more stylish options for and find ways to buy them more cheaply   these might be things like fleece tops trendy jackets things where the style is actually noticed   i buy jeans at old navy for my son when they are on sale i buy at sears when they are 40 off in sept oct   the childrens place has good quality stylish clothing for kids and if you watch they always have deals on their jeans or tops then i stock up   and for younger kids old navy and the children 's place jeans have adjustable   i 've already and let out the in my son 's back to school jeans i have friends who are starting to take in bags of too small clothing to consignment shops if they come away with $ 100 it 's still $ 100    for and teen kids who want certain brands etc i think it is very reasonable to say we will pay x for each pair of jeans or x for winter boots   if you want to throw in some babysitting birthday money and go buy something more expensive you are welcome to do so   that way you are still paying for basics but they can feel like they are n't stuck wearing things they do n't like   tell them you can buy 5 tops at $ x each for back to school or 10 tops at $ x.    and lastly and most sadly of all   buy less and stop shopping   there i said it out loud   i try to be careful of what i buy but i still find things i bought that were never worn   now i keep a return basket in laundry if i do n't love it if it seems impractical now that i got it home if i wanted it just in case item 1 did n't work it goes in the basket   and i return them   i suck it up i take it with me and go get my money back   mistakes can be fixed if the items have n't been worn or washed

there 's several approaches to the stock market the first thing you need to do is decide which you 're going to take the first is the case of the standard investor saving money for retirement or some other long term goal he already has a job he 's not really interested in another job he does n't want to spend thousands of hours doing research he should buy mutual funds or similar instruments to build diversified holdings all over the world he 's going to have is money invested for years at a time he wo n't earn spectacular amazing awesome returns but he 'll earn solid returns there will be a few years when he loses money but he 'll recover it just by waiting the second is the case of the day trader he attempts to understand ultra short term movements in stock prices due to news rumors and other things which stem from quirks of the market and the people who trade in it he buys a stock and when it 's up a fraction of a percent half an hour later sells it this is very risky requires a lot of attention and a good amount of money to work with and you can lose a lot of money too the modern day trader also needs to compete with the high frequency trading desks of wall street firms with super optimized computer networks located a block away from the exchange so that they can make orders faster than the guy two blocks away i do n't recommend this approach at all the third case is the guy who wants to beat the market he 's got long term aspirations and vision but he does a lot more research into individual companies figures out which are worth buying and which are not and invests accordingly this is how warren buffett made it big you can make it work but it 's like starting a business it 's a ton of work requires a good amount of money to get going and you still risk losing lots of it   the fourth case is the guy who mostly invests in broad market indexes like 1 but has a little money set aside for the stocks he 's researched and likes enough to invest in like 3 he 's not going to make money like warren buffett but he may get a little bit of an edge on the rest of the market if he does n't and ends up losing money there instead the rest of his stocks are still chugging along the last and way is to treat it all like magic buying things without understanding them or a clear plan of what you 're going to do with them you risk losing all your money you also risk having it stagnate good to see you want to avoid it

they would definitely buy at premium but how much higher would depend on how they value the company there are many ways how a pe firm would do this and it ’s not easy to guess without knowing more financial information    i ’m a bit curious when you say they would want to buy all shares typically pe firm would n’t buy out all since they would still require the owner proprietor to continue developing the products unless the products are matured and it ’s a 100 makeover transformation while this is possible it ’s quite rare at least from my experience    if your shares are significant enough and you want to keep it you may do so but it ’ll require massive efforts when you ’d want to liquidate later since it ’ll be in a private market it ’ll hard to value for other buyers and the known buyers might squeeze you if you ’re desperate to sell    disclaimer some years of experience in pe regulations might differ in your geographical location

is this an employee stock purchase plan espp if so and there is no required holding period selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk one caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop if your discount is only 5 for example a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out the only other cons i can think of is espp contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return and it complicates your taxes a bit on the flip side another pro is that after you sell the shares you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it

first check with your lender to see if the terms of the loan allow early payoff   if you are able to payoff early without penalty with the numbers you are posting i would hesitate to refinance this is simply because if you actually do pay 5k month on this loan you will have it paid off so quickly that refinancing will probably not save you much money back of the napkin math at 5k month has you paying 60k pounds a year which will payoff in about 5 years   even if you can afford 5k month i would recommend not paying extra on this debt ahead of other high interest debt or saving in a tax advantaged retirement account if these other things are being taken care of and you have liquid assets cash for emergencies i would recommend paying off the mortgage without refinancing

support and resistance points indicate price levels where there have been a large amount of trading activity usually from institutions that tend to stabilize the price of a stock support is a temporary floor where people have been buying in large quantities that means there 's a good chance that the stock wo n't go below this level in the near term but if it does watch out resistance is a temporary ceiling where people have been selling when the stock price hits this level people tend to sell and push it back down until there are no more sellers at this level then the price could skyrocket if there is enough buying

from what i 've read paying down your mortgage above and beyond what you 'd normally pay is indeed an investment but a very poor form of investment in other words you could take that extra money you 'd apply towards your mortgage and put it in something that has a much higher rate of return than a house as an extreme example consider if i took $ 6k extra i would have paid toward my mortgage in a single year and bought a nice performing stock i could see returns of 2x or 3x now that implies i know which stock to pick etcetera i found a mortgage or investment calculator which could be of use as well scroll to bottom to see the summary and whether or not prepay or invest wins for the numbers you plugged in

from what i understand i never had an resp but would consider one for a future child with the right type of withdrawal you can use the resp money for anything education related basically know that the resp is considered to have three within it 1 your contributions 2 contributions from the government through the canada education savings grant cesg and 3 the return on the investment or accumulated earnings the government contributes an extra 20 on top of your contributions annually by way of the cesg up to a $ 500 max tuition as you noted official tuition fees reported on a fee slip is where one large chunk of the resp will go this will be pulled out of your original contributions and is known as a post secondary education withdrawal different resp administrators bank discount brokerage etc determine what sort of proof of would be required but it ought to be similar between them and different educational institutions this withdrawal is not taxable by either you or the student since the contributions were made with after tax dollars educational assistance payments are for other expenses that the student would incur by being at university in the first 13 weeks of studies you can request up to $ 5000 in withdrawals full time studies $ 2500 for par time after which there is no limit each payment is made up of the cesg and accumulated earnings portions of the resp whose proportions are determined based on the amount this is considered taxable income for the student or beneficiary in the year the withdrawal is made it gets a bit fuzzy here from my understanding the student would ostensibly be able to purchase anything that they could rationalize as education related and i 'm not sure what sort of proof different banks would need maybe just the confirmation of is enough this is the part of my post that should directly answer your question which using this terminology boils down to what sorts of expenses can i use the withdrawals for to this from what i 've read out there i would say that you could probably purchase anything from the student 's point of view they are enrolled in a qualifying education institution and if they do n't spend the money on education related purchases money required for those purchases will have to come from somewhere else anyway   other withdrawals any other type of withdrawal is like walking through a you can withdraw the original contributions without paying tax on them but you would need to pay back the corresponding cesg back to the government other types of withdrawals would be taxable and may incur a 20 penalty i do n't have any more details on that as i mentioned this is from what i 've read and looked into for future resp purposes a new concept that has popped up is resp vs tfsa the tfsa provides the same tax shelter after tax dollar contributions no tax on the gains but also allows for no tax on the withdrawals to add to that the tfsa withdrawals are tax free as well the main benefit that the resp offers that the tfsa does n't is the cesg my current opinion and i could be wrong is that you should contribute $ 2500 annually to the resp in order to get the $ 500 max cesg and anything else that you 'd like to contribute should go in a tfsa but i digress hopefully my long winded response makes some sense enjoy

as joetaxpayer says it 's a very rare circumstance where an early 401(k withdrawal actually makes any real economic sense your statements that one year 's salary for you is $ 60 k and the combination of your spouse 's income and yours puts you into the highest income tax bracket together lead to the conclusion that your spouse 's income is considerably higher than yours if this income will continue past your death e.g. you two are not in a joint venture that will collapse when you pass away because she can not do the work by herself then it is very definitely to your joint advantage to leave your money in a tax deferred account for as long as possible her income should be enough to cover the mortgage payments   also rather than take the money out and paying taxes at a high rate right now your   spouse can roll over the 401k money into an ira and withdraw only small amounts per year paying taxes spread over the years rather than in a lump sum

gt bernie sources    i would agree it looks like the tax would cover all those that buy stock bonds and derivatives however this article did n't really cover the specifics what would the tax be would it a flat dollar amount per transaction that would make sense as it would focus more on those that do high volume traders that would n't really impact me as i already pay $ 9 per transaction and i do n't do many transactions a couple dollars more and i would be fine    gt to answer your enron example no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they did n't have at least partial backing by the government   ah but corporations edit would n't have the power to do much of anything without someone to enforce their policies name one market that does n't have an enforcement agency of some type that is a mighty big assumption that the free market would make it work especially since one does n't really exist    and that would be the crux of my argument all of the things you say about the perfection of the market to regulate itself is so far not proven    take a market like kansas over the last 6 years they just one of the largest deregulation de taxation experiments of any state in the union the results were less than stellar kansas is lagging the national average in growth and they took a hundred million dollar surplus and turned into a couple billion dollar deficit almost overnight and who suffers of course the most poor they shut down schools fired teachers and many infrastructure jobs jobs that would have been by lower wage workers and those infrastructure projects were undoubtedly in lower income areas    i would say if you truly believe in what you preach then live it start a somewhere demonstrate how it is effective that would have more power than preaching some amorphous policy over the internet

but is the money saved taxable not sure i understand the question if say you have salary of rs 5 lacs after paying taxes and expenses lets say you save rs 1 lacs if you keep this 1 lacs in savings account you will get interest if this interest is less than rs 10,000/- it is not taxable if it is more that rs 10,000 then the additional amount is taxable i.e. if you get a savings bank interest of rs the difference rs 15,000 minus rs 10,000 i.e. rs 5000 is taxable note if you keep the 1 lacs in fixed deposits then all interest even if you get rs 1 is taxable edit if you invest the rs 1 lacs in tax saving fd lock in period of 6 years then yes you can claim deduction under section 80c.

no such evidence exists because many people do beat the market and many people fail to earn market rate of return the way you achieve the former is generally to take risks that also increase the likelihood of the latter the amount of time and effort you invest may bias that result but generally risk and potential reward tend to track pretty closely since everyone else is making the same evaluations you ca n't prove a negative we ca n't prove unicorns do n't exist either we can advise you that hunting for one is probably not productive many others have been trying and if there was one we 'd probably have seen at least something that encourages us to continue looking not impossible but the evidence is far from encouraging market rate of return can be achieved fairy reliably with minimal risk and minimal effort and at mostly long term tax rates i consider that sufficient for my needs others will feel otherwise

reich is trying to highlight the disparity between the market price of a person 's labor and the real social value of that labor but while the former concept has a standard definition in modern economics the latter does not and reich does not offer one that is why i found the article it 's clear he is the disparity but he gives no clue about what the disparity actually amounts to   case in point   gt does anyone seriously believe hedge fund steven a. cohen is worth the $ 2.3 billion he in last year despite being slapped with a $ 1.8 billion fine after his firm guilty to insider trading   i would wager that whoever paid cohen the money believes it pretty seriously by asking whether anyone so believes reich assumes away the existence of whoever pays cohen his tone throughout the rest of the article is similar yet this is precisely where reich could have stepped in with a definition of social value e.g.   gt stephen a. cohen in $ 2.3 billion last year despite being slapped with an $ fine because of insider trading by his firm yet the social value of his work is far lower than $ 2.3 billion here 's what i mean by social value and a way to approximate it   here is something reich does say later on that is probably true and worth emphasizing   gt most financiers corporate lawyers lobbyists and management consultants are competing with other financiers lawyers lobbyists and management consultants in zero sum games that take money out of one set of pockets and put it into another   of course this is also true of many government officials athletes and social activists but the concept of a socially wasteful zero sum game and its implications for welfare ought to be much more widely understood by the general public reich should be praised for calling attention to some examples of it but it would have been much better if he had on it a little more instead of just ranting

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

one piece of documentation that might help here is a confirmation of your benefit selections through your employer for each year since the expenses in question were incurred assuming you have a job with eligibility for benefits   if you can prove which accounts you maintained through your your spouse 's if applicable then it is relatively simple to go back through the records for those specific accounts and see if a specific expense was ever reimbursed   obviously you ca n't prove through documentation that you did n't have accounts that do n't exist this seems like it would be more important for the accounts elected by a significant other since i believe reimbursements from an account in your name would typically be reported to the irs on your behalf anyway also keep in mind that the irs wo n't care about each line item individually   their focus will be on whether for any given snapshot in time your total reimbursed amount exceeded your total eligible expenses

do n't sell ever   well almost a number of studies have shown that buying equal amounts of shares randomly will beat the market long term and certainly wo n't do badly   starting from this premise then perhaps you can add a tiny bit extra with your skill maybe but who knows you might suck   point is when buying you have the wind behind you a monkey would make money selling is a different matter you have the cost of trading out and back in to something else only to have changed from one monkey portfolio to the other if you have skill that covers this cost then yes you should do this but how confident are you a few studies have been done on retail broker accounts and they show the same story   retail investors on average lose money on their switches even if you believe you have a real edge on the market   you 're strategy still should not just say sell when it drops out of your criteria   your criteria are positive indicators lack of positive is not a negative indicator   sell when you would happily go short the stock    that is you are really confident it is going down otherwise leave it

hello reddit friends family amp future guests of the greenhouse inn park 's nj first eco friendly bed and breakfast   i have wonderful news from the small business administration sba and the local community bank as they have agreed to finance 90 of the startup costs to open the greenhouse inn woo they have affirmed their support and are ready to get the ball rolling but i will need to supply 10 of the projects total cost in equity   for instance a bank will usually lend only if you have 10 of the amount you require therefore if we have $ 1,000 getting a bank loan of up to $ 10,000 should be feasible this is oversimplified but in a way it means that every single dollar contributed gives the greenhouse access to ten more if we make $ 20,000 dollars on we might be able to get a loan of $ 200,000 dollars

i am in a different situation because i earn more than i spend but i have found that i need to make the money inaccessible if i want to really avoid spending it   i used to just throw my paychecks into a high yield savings account but eventually the balance was large enough that a large purchase did n't seem like that much because i would have had so much left in the account after the purchase   it was way too easy for me to spend way too much now i invest my savings automatically   the obvious benefit is my money has a much higher growth rate than a simple savings account especially with fed interest rates so low   i invest most of my savings in retirement accounts where there are severe penalties for withdrawing prior to retirement age   then i invest a significant portion to a regular brokerage account where the money is invested in stock and bond funds   this money is accessible within a few days of whenever i need it   the remainder of my savings goes into a savings account as cash i can get to at any time   all 3 accounts grow with every paycheck market fluctuations aside    this system helps me to categorize my savings as never ever touch retirement accounts touch only if i can wait 3 days and am willing to pay taxes brokerage account or touch whenever you need it with no penalties savings account   if my savings account grows too much i 'll move money from there to the brokerage account where it has more growth potential   the longer my money is invested in the brokerage accounts the less taxes i 'll need to pay when i sell withdraw the funds so that 's even more incentive for me to keep those funds where they are i have credit cards so in my opinion having to wait 3 days for funds from my investment account to become accessible is considered accessible in an emergency because my credit cards can be used to cover a large purchase for 3 days and as long as i pay it off within the grace period there 's no interest charged tl;dr investing is probably the smartest way to both grow your money and prevent the urge to spend it right away   my advice is to start with a 401(k or ira as soon as you can since the younger you are the more time until retirement that your money has to compound   investing $ 100 more a month can mean hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in your account when you 're ready to retire

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a negative effect over the average long term performance of industries and average long term increase in wages

insurance is bought for peace of mind and to divert disaster    diverting disaster is a good great thing   if your house burned down if someone hit your car or some other devastating event think medical happened that required a more allocation than you could afford the series of issues may snowball and cause you to lose a far greater amount of money than the initial incident   this could be in the form of losing work time losing a job having to buy transportation quickly paying a premium having to incur high rate debt and so on    for the middle income and lower classes medical house and medical insurance certainly falls into these categories   also why a lot of states have buyout options on auto insurance some will let you drive without insurance by proving bonding up to 250k.    now the other insurance as i have alluded to is for peace of mind mainly   this is your laptop insurance vacation insurance and so on   the premise of these insurances is that no matter what happens you can get back to even by paying just a little extra    however what other answers have failed to clarify is the idea of insurance   it is an agreement that you will pay a company money right now   and then if a certain set of events happen you follow their guidelines they are still in business they still have the same protocols and so on that you will get some benefit when something happens to you   we buy insurance because we think we can snap our fingers and life will be back to normal   for bigger things like medical home and auto there are more regulations but i could get 1000 comments on people getting screwed over by their insurance companies   for smaller things almost all insurance is outsourced to a 3rd party not affiliated legally with a business   therefore if the costs are too high they can simply go under and if the costs are low they continue helping the consumer that does n't need help    so we buy insurance divert catastrophe or because we have fallen for the insurance sales pitch   and an easy way to get around the sales pitch as the person selling you the insurance if you can have their name and info and they will be personally liable if the insurance company fails their end of the bargain

the conclusions of this report seem to conflict with some of the long term trends in asset management the gradual decline of defined benefit plans e.g. pensions and the growth of defined contribution 401k have altered the asset mix   the biggest investors in hedge funds have traditionally been pension management funds given the long standing decline in private sector pensions and the seemingly near future decline in public employee pensions the funds that can only be accessed by institutional investors or accredited investors eg all hedge funds stand to lose    explained another way right now only rich people and institutional investors get access to hedge funds your 401 k money ca n't go into them and neither can your ira if you 're not an accredited investor income of k net worth of $ primary residence you ca n't subscribe you can only get into hedge funds through buying into a fund of funds type of investment where you buy a fund and pay that fund so that they can pay a hedge manager to manage the money think of a pass through entity that some off the top and manages portfolio risk so as fewer people get pensions and the pensions that they do get are smaller these pension funds have fewer assets left to invest in hedge funds    most hedge funds return zero alpha after fees and arguably have lower risk adjusted returns than simpler investments but 15 20 of all hedge funds do pretty well picking which 15 that 's difficult    bottom line what is citi pushing with this report

actually most insurance policies don't have a cash value if you do n't make a claim   the reason that some life insurance policies do this is that they are really tax sheltered investments posing as insurance   with that in mind the root of your question is really whether insurance premiums are wasted if you never make a claim it really makes no difference if you are talking about ei auto or homeowner 's insurance my answer to that is no what you are paying for when you buy insurance is financial risk avoidance look at it this way you do n't buy ei as an investment where you hope to get a return on your investment you are buying the right to be protected against catastrophic financial difficulty associated with losing your job whether you claim it or not you did receive that protection this is what drives me so crazy when i hear people talk about how an insurance company is ripping you off because you paid more in premiums than they paid out in benefits of course you did if most people did n't pay in more than the company paid out there would be no financial interest for someone to form an insurance company

it 's still an asset because you 're keeping it on your books in an interest bearing account   and it 's still also a liability because as you note the money is not technically yours and you owe it to the renter until you settle at the end of the lease term   thus i 'd recommend setting the security deposit up in two accounts an asset account and a liability account   the two will cancel each other out so it wo n't add to your net worth or equity    if the money is in a bank account that 's shared for other purposes you can create a sub account for the security deposit deposit $ 1500 and the liability can simply be deposit $ 1500 you of course can modify these to best fit your account structure e.g. organize by property etc finally instead of transferring the money from an income account to your savings account you transfer it directly from the liability account in one go

this is the same as any case where income is variable   how do you deal with the months where expected cash flows are lower than projected when i got married my wife was in the habit of allocating money to be spent in the current month from income accrued during the previous month   this is slightly complicated because we account for taxes and benefit expenses withheld in the current months paychecks as current expenses but we allocate the gross income from that check to the following month for spending the benefit of spending only money made during the previous month is that income shocks are less shocking   i was working for a start up and they missed payroll that normally arrived on the first of the month   most of my co workers were calling the bank in a panic to avoid over draft fees with their mortgage payments but my mortgage payment was already covered   similarly when the same start up had a reduction in force on the first day of a new quarter i did n't have to pull any money from savings during the 3 weeks i was unemployed in the end you 're going to have to allocate money to the budget based on the actual income which is lower than your expectations   what part of the budget should fairly be reduced is a question you and your wife will have to figure out

when a delisting happens the primary process involves the firm or the entity trying to buy everyone out so that they can take the firm private by delisting from the stock exchanges as the firm wants to buy everyone out the current owners of the equity have the upper hand they would n't want to sell if they believe the firm has a brighter future so to compensate the existing holders the buyer needs to compensate the current holders of any future loss so they pay a premium to buy them out hence the prices offered will be more than the current existing price and in anticipation of a premium the stocks price rises on this speculation the other scenario is if the current decide no to sell their holdings and are small in number dependent on exchange regulations and the buyer manages to de list the stock the holders might loose out i.e. they have to find another buyer who wants to buy which becomes difficult as the liquidity for the stock is very minimal if any stock is de listed and then we can not trade on it   in india if the promoters capital is more than 90 he can get the stock de listed there is a process he has to make an open offer at specified price to minority shareholders the minority shareholder can refuse to sell once the stock is de listed it means it can not be traded on a given exchange however you can still sell buy by directly finding a buyer seller and it 's difficult compared to a listed stock

do n't set mental anchor points i am saying this as a total hypocrite mind you it is n't easy to follow that advice my suggestion would be to look at each investment and ask yourself would i buy that at today 's price because if you would n't you need to sell regardless of whether you are cashing out effectively by staying in an investment you no longer believe in you are giving up the opportunity cost of investing that money in something with a real chance to   give you a return or in your case whatever purpose you have in mind for the cash

there 's already an excellent answer here from but i wanted to expand a bit on types of investments with some additional actionable information you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply    collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and    many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer    is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for    retirement you should be investing in the stock market however    picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in    a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the    stock market so how does one go about actually investing in the stock market in a diversified way what if you also want to diversify a bit into bonds fortunately in the last several years several products have come about that do just these things and are targeted towards newer investors these are often labeled robo advisors most even allow you to adjust your allocation according to your risk preferences here 's a list of the ones i know about while these products all to achieve similar goals of giving you an easy way to obtain a diversified portfolio according to your risk they differ in the buckets of stocks and funds they put your money into the careful investor would be wise to compare which specific etfs they use e.g. looking at their expense ratios capitalization and spreads

the other responses are correct in that financially you should pay off the highest interest rate debt first while paying the minimum on any lower interest rate debt to avoid any fees or penalties however there is one more trick you might consider unless you have the $ 20k available to pay the discover debt immediately and you say you have $ so far you could roll over your private debt over to a new card with a lower interest rate it 's pretty common to find balance transfers deals that charge a 3 transfer fee to have 0 apy for 1 year   if you are an organized person and are sure you wo n't forget to balance transfer again in the future this would bring your private debt down to and make your highest effective interest rate the $ debt at 6 and you could pay that down first that 's the extreme version and requires you to set a calendar alert 10 11 months in the future   a less extreme tactic would be to try to switch your private debt once to a lower rate you probably could find a card with 0 apy for 1 year and then 7 8 afterwards without continuing to balance transfer in the future   then it would be closer to negligible which debt you chose to pay down first between private and and in that case i 'd advocate finishing off the smaller debt entirely because it would be the highest rate at that moment and to feel good about knocking one off and to reduce the number of fees and credit score hits if you ever took a vacation and was late on a monthly payment

the response to this question will be different depending which of the investment you are using   value investors look at the situation the company is in and try to determine what the company is worth and what it will be worth in the future then they look at the current stock price and decide whether or not the stock is priced at a good deal or not if the stock price is priced lower than they believe the company is worth they would want to buy stock and if the price rises above what they believe to be the true value they would sell these types of investors are not looking at the history or trend of what the price has done in the past only what the current price is and where they believe the price should be in the future   technical analysis investors do something different it is their belief that as stock prices go up and down they generally follow patterns by looking at a chart of what a stock price has been in the past they try to predict where it is headed and buy or sell based on that prediction   in general value investors are longer term investors and technical analysis investors are short term investors   the advice you are considering makes a lot of sense if you are using technical analysis if you have a stock that is trending down your strategy probably tells you to sell buying more in the hopes of turning things around would be seen as a mistake it is like the gambler in vegas who keeps playing a game he is losing hoping that his luck changes   however for the value investor the historical price of a stock and even the amount you currently have gained or lost in the stock are essentially ignored all that matters is whether or not the stock price is above or below the true value determined by the investor for him if the stock price falls and he believes the company still has a high value it could be a signal to buy more the above advice does n't really apply for them   many investors do n't follow either of these strategies they believe that it is too difficult and risky to try to predict the future price of an individual stock instead they invest in many companies all at once using index mutual funds believing that the stock market as a whole always heads up over a long time frame those investors do n't care at all if the prices of stock are going up or down they simply keep investing each month and hold until they have another use for the money the above advice is n't useful for them at all   no matter which kind of investing you are doing the most important thing is to pick a strategy you believe in and follow the plan without emotion emotions can cause investors to make mistakes and start buying when their strategy tells them to sell   instead of trying to follow fortune cookie advice like do n't throw good money after bad choose an investment strategy make a plan test it and follow it cautiously after all it may be a bad plan for what it is worth i am the third type of investor listed above i do n't buy individual stocks and i do n't look at the stock prices when investing more each month your description of your own strategy as buy and hold suggests you might prefer the same approach

i would deduct all the other payments out as subcontractors but i typically have all the paperwork and entities set up to make that applicable in turbotax i do this with as expense under my business entity but for the irs the categories of the deductions do not matter this is n't tax advice it is what i would do and how i would defend it under an audit everyone else that was paid also needs to report it the lack of reciprocal filing you deducted income paid to someone else the person did not report that income or reported it in a different way is a number one thing to trigger irs scrutiny although accurate you need to be aware that you are shifting the tax burden away from yourself by deducting it

you can set up a self managed super fund smsf and use it to buy residential investment property and as justin has mentioned even borrow to acquire the investment property through the smsf   however you can not hold your home in the smsf as this would be classed as an in house asset and you are only allowed to hold a maximum of 5 of the total market value of smsf as in house assets furthermore as you already own your house you are not allowed to transfer residential property into a smsf from a related party even if done at current market value you are allowed to transfer business real property from a related party at current market value regarding loans you are not allowed to lend money from your smsf to a related party as well

private equity is simply some type of an investment company which is owned in a way not accessible to the public ie warren buffet runs berkshire which is an investment company which itself is traded on the new york stock exchange this means that anyone can buy shares in the company and own a small fraction of it if warren buffet owned all the shares of berkshire it would be a private equity company note that equity refers to the ownership of the company itself a private investment company may simply buy bonds which are a form of debt in which case they would not be technically considered a private equity company a hedge fund is a very broad term which i do n't believe has significant meaning technically it means something along the lines of an investment fund either public or private which attempts to hedge the risks of its portfolio by carefully considering what type of investments it purchased this refers back to the meaning of hedge ie hedging your bets in my opinion hedge fund is not meaningfully different from investment fund or other similar terms it is just the most popular way to refer to this type of industry at the present time   you can see the trend of using the term investment fund vs hedge fund using this link note that the high point of the use of hedge fund occurred on october 2008 right at the peak of the global financial crisis the term a certain image of high finance wall street types that may exploit various situations such as tax legislation or secret information for their own gain without a clear definition however it is a term without much meaning if you do a similar comparison between hedge fund and private equity you can see that the two correlate very closely i believe the term private equity is similarly misused to generally refer to investment bankers however in that case private equity has a more clear definition on its own merits

one way to value companies is to use a dividend discount model in substance it consists in estimating future dividends and calculating their present value so it is a methodology which considers that an equity is similar to a bond and estimates its current value based on future cash flows a company may not be paying dividends now but because its future earnings prospects are good may pay some in the future in that case the model will give a non zero value to that stock if on the other hand you think a company wo n't ever make any profits and therefore never pay any dividends then it 's probably worth 0 take microsoft as an example it currently pays ~3 dividend per annum the stock has been listed since 1986 and yet it did not pay any dividends until 2003 but the stock has been rising regularly since the beginning because people had priced in the fact that there was a high chance that the company would become very profitable which proved true in the long term + 60,000 including dividends since the ipo

because you actually reside in new zealand your income taxes will be paid in new zealand however as a non resident of australia you will have tax withholding on all of the interest you earn in an australian bank account obviously because that tax is paid to australia that will not be counted against your new zealand income taxes due to the taxation agreement between those countries you should still discuss this with an accountant in new zealand and consider acting as a sole trader since you are doing freelance work that seems like the most logical setup anyway

if your requirements are hard must have $ 1000/month must have the same or bigger in capital at the end stocks are a poor choice of investment however in many cases people are willing to tolerate some level of risk to achieve the expected returns you also do not mention inflation which can take quite a lot out of your portfolio over the course of ten years if we make some simplifying assumptions you want to generate $ 12,000 a year you can realistically expect the whole stock market long term i.e. over time periods substantially longer than 10 years to return approximately 4 5 after factoring in inflation that means an investment of $ 240,000 $ 300,000 the math is simplified somewhat here if you do n't care about inflation you can up the percentage rather somewhat according to this article the s&p 500 returned an average of from through 2010 not factoring in inflation which would require an investment of approximately $ but this opens you up to substantial risk the stock market may go down 30 this year according to the above article the s&p returned only from 2001 to 2010 long term it goes up but your investment case is really to investing in an index to the entire stock market given your requirements you may be better suited investing primarily in stable bonds or perhaps a mix of bonds and stocks alternatively you may want to consider even more stable investments such as treasury notes treasury notes are all but guaranteed but with a lousy rate of return heck you could consider a gic that may be canada only or even a savings account there 's also the possibility of purchasing an annuity though almost everyone will advise against such personally i 'd go for a mutual fund which invested approximately 70 bonds and the rest in stocks over such a time period something like ing direct 's balanced income portfolio if you were in canada it substantially lowers your expected return but also lowers your risk i ca n't honestly say what the expected return there is at this point it 's returned 4 per year before inflation but has been around only since the beginning of 2008 and to be clear this is absolutely not free of risk

as nathan has correctly noted ach processes transactions in daily batches the reason for that is accounting the money does n't actually change hands for each transaction all the transactions are aggregated and calculated in the batch process and the money only changes hands for the difference consider this if each transaction was to be handled separately each time banks would have to adjust their books to account for the money movement but if we do it in batch we have this the resulting inter bank transfers total for the original 30 transactions 2 transactions between the banks and if you need money to be transferred immediately relatively you can use wire transfer some banks will still aggregate and batch process those but more than once a day they 'll charge you additional fee for their inconvenience
