the idea is to positively identify you with properly issued government id if you show up with your passport visa and another form of government issued identification which the banker can recognize and use for example international driver 's license a us state driver 's license eu internal id etc it will be quick and painless usually at least two distinct forms of identification are required from foreigners passport and something else and not the visa stamped in a passport that just shoes to show your status upon your requirements may be based you 'll probably be asked for a tin before any payments are made to you by the bank if you do n't have anything credible to show as your identification it will be equally quick and painless except that you 'd be leaving without a bank account if your identity can not be established properly there and then they will not serve you

my approach wo n't work for everyone but i keep a longer list of things i want in my head preferably including higher value items   i then look at the cost of an item vs the amount of benefit it gets me either enjoyment or ability to make more money or both   if i only had a few things i wanted it would be easy to buy them even if the payback was n't that great but because i have a large list of things i 'd like to be able to do it 's easier to play the comparison game in my head do i want this $ 50 thing now that will only give me a little bit of enjoyment and no income or would i rather be able to get that $ 3000 digital cinema camera that i would enjoy having and could work on projects with and actually make money off of this is a rl example that i actually just bought last week after making sure i had solid leads on enough projects to pay myself back over time   for me it is much easier to compare with an alternative thing i 'd enjoy particularly since i enjoy hobbies that can pay for themselves which is really the situation this strategy works best in it might not work for everyone but hobbies that pay for themselves can take many different forms   mine tends to be very direct get a v tool do projects that pay money but it can also be indirect get sports stuff save on gym membership over time   if you can get things onto your list that can save you money in the long run then this strategy can work pretty well if not you 'll still have the overall saving problem just with a longer wish list that said if you are good about saving already and simply want to make better use of your disposable income then having a longer list may also work to let you seek out better deals for you   if you have funds that you know you can spend on enjoyment it is going to be difficult to choose nothing over something that gives enjoyment even if it is n't a great return on the money   if you have alternatives that would give you better value then it 's easier to avoid the low value option

as far as trading is concerned these forward curves are the price at which you can speculate on the future value of the commodity   basically if you want to speculate on gold you can either buy the physical and store it somewhere which may have significant costs or you can buy futures etfs typically hold futures or hold physical and store it for you   if you buy futures you will have to roll your position every month meaning you sell the current month 's futures and buy the next month 's   however these may not be trading at the same price so each time you roll your position you face a risk   if you know you want to hold gold for exactly 1 year then you can buy a 1-year future which in this case according to your graph will cost you about $ 10 more than buying the front month   the forward curve or sometimes called the futures term structure represents the prices at which gold can be bought or sold at various points in the future

if best buy gets wiped out that would suck   sometimes i like the options of   being able to take home today being able to look at products in the store   i 've made 2 recent electronics purchases   1   i bought a notebook computer from amazon   i have been shopping for a few months looking at amazon and looking at computers in the stores   i was looking for a few specific things where the power cord plugs in if the function keys were primary or secondary etc   that the amazon ad did n't specify so i went to various stores to see how they worked out   but amazon had the best price by about $ 40 i have prime so i had to order through amazon   i feel a tiny bit bad about that because i theoretically used the merchandising of other stores to buy at amazon 2   i bought a sound bar for my tv at best buy   one day i decided i wanted to get a sound bar   it was something i had been thinking about for a long time but bought on an impulse that day   it was nice to go into best buy and get to look at a whole bunch of options and then just buy one and take it home   i never even checked to see if amazon had the same item available   i like to think that if best buy did go out of business that some other business idea would come along that would make it easy for me to see products in person and have the option for buy today

i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

i agree with joe that you seem to have your stuff together however i ca n't disagree more otherwise   you are getting a loan at such a cheap rate that it would be almost impossible to not substantially beat that rate over the next 15 20 years   you paying off your home early might give you warm fuzzy feeling but would make me   this is a money website   make money for our purposes let 's say your home is worth 500k you can get a fixed rate loan at 3 over 30 years and you can earn 7 on your investments per year   note that i have earned 12 on mine the past 15 years so i am being pretty conservative so let 's not get into your other stuff because that is fine   let 's focus just on that 500k your house interest only loan for the whole   the flip side is you pay off your house   your house could be worth 400 k in 30 years   probably not but neighborhood could decline house not kept up or whatever   your house is not a risk free investment   and it fluctuate in many areas more than the stock market   but let 's just say your area stays ok or normal   in 30 years you can expect your house to be worth somewhere between 700k to 1.5 million   let 's just say you did great with your house   guess what   at 1.5 million selling price you still lost 1.5 million because of your decision plus sunk your money into a less liquid option    let the bank take the risk on your house price   the warm fuzzy feeling will be there when you realize you could rebuy your house two times over in 6 7 years note i know my example does n't use your exact numbers   i am just showing what your true cost is of making a decision in the most extreme way   i am guessing you have great credit and might be able to find an all interest loan at 3   so not doing this is costing you 1.5 million over 30 years   given a lower home price after 30 years or a higher rate of return this easily be much more   if you earned 12 over the 30 year period you would be costing yourself 16 million do the math   now you are talking about doing something in between   which means you will basically have the same risk factors with less return

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

the limit order are matched based on amount and time the orders are listed highest to lowest on the buy side the orders are listed lowest to highest on the sell side if there are 2 sell orders for same amount the order which is first in time fractions of milliseconds is first   the about is the example as to how the orders would look like on any exchange   now the highest price the buyer is ready to pay is 20.21 and the lowest price a seller is ready to sell for is 20.25 hence there is no trade now if a new buy order comes in at 20.25 it matches with the sell and the deal is made if a new buy order comes in at it still matches at 20.25 similarly if a sell order come in at 20.21 it matches and a deal is made if a sell order come in at it still matches 20.21    incase of market order with the above example if there is a buy order it would match with the lowest sell order at 20.25 if there is not enough quantity it would match the remaining quantity to the next highest at and continue down similarly if there is a sell market order the it would match to the maximum a seller is ready to buy ie 20.21 if there is not sufficient buy quantity at 20.21 it will match with next for    if say there are new buy order at and sell orders at these will sit first the the above queue to be matched in your above example the lowest sell order was at at time t1 and hence any buy order after time t1 for amount or greater would match to this and the price would be however if the buy order was first ie at t1 there was a buy order for 20.21 and then at time later than t1 there is a sell order for say amount less than or equal to 20.21 it would match for 20.21 essentially the market looks at who was the first to sell at lower price or who was the first to buy at higher price and then decide the trade   edit to clarify xyz say if there is an sell order at $ 10 qty 100 there is a buyer who is willing to pay max $ 20 and is looking for qty 500 your key assumption that the buyer does not know the current sell price of $ 10 is incorrect now there are multiple things the buyer knows the lowest sell order is at $ 10 he can put a matching buy order at $ 10 qty 100 and say $ 11 qty 100 etc this is painful second lets say he puts a buy order at $ 10 qty 100 by the time the order hits the system someone else has put the trade at $ 10 and his order is fulfilled so this buyer has to keep looking at booking and keep making adjustments if its a large order it would be extremely difficult and frustrating for this buyer hence the logic of giving preference the later buy order says the max i can pay is $ 20 match at the current price and get the required shares

your initial premise mid cap and small cap company stocks have outperformed the market is partially correct they have over many 40 yr periods provided higher returns than large caps or bond funds the important thing to consider here is that risk adjusted the returns from a diversified portfolio are far more robust with proper asset allocation you and expect high returns and reduce your risk simultaneously   imagine this scenario you decide to stick to small mid caps for 10 15 yrs and move into a more diversified portfolio then had you made that decision during a sustained period of poor small cap performance late 80s or the 40 's you would have lost a of return as those were periods were small underperformed the market as a whole and large caps in particular as an example from 1946 to large caps outperformed small every single year if 2016 were to be the first year of a similar trend you 've done yourself a major disservice   since the dot com crash small have outperformed for sure pretty much every year but that does n't mean that they will continue to do so the reason asset allocation exists is precisely this over a 40 yr period no single asset class outperforms a diversified portfolio   if you attempt to time the market even if you do so with a multi decade time horizon in mind there a good chance that you will do more poorly

is the parent company 's common stock public    if not then there will be absolutely no pressure from everyone liquidating at the same time if so consider the average daily volume of transactions in the parent company 's stock   is it much greater than the volume your 10k co workers will have to liquidate    if so i would n't expect much of an impact from all liquidating at once any other situation you are probably right to be a bit worried about simultaneous liquidation    if this was my case i 'd probably submit a limit sell order so as to try and pick out a high for the timing of my liquidation and lower my limit vs fair value as it got closer to the expiration of your ability to hold the parent company stock

i would not take this personal loan let 's look closer at your options currently you are paying $ 1100 a month in rent and you have all the money saved up that you need to be able to pay cash for school   that 's a good position to be in you are proposing to take out a loan and buy an apartment   between your new mortgage and your new personal loan payment you 'll be paying $ 1500 a month and that is before you pay for the extra expenses involved in owning such as property taxes insurance etc   yes you 'll be gaining some equity in an apartment but in the short term over the next two years you 'll be spending more money and in the first two years of a 30 year mortgage almost all of your payment is interest anyway   in two years from now you 'll have a master 's degree and hopefully be able to make more income   will you want to get a new job   will you be moving to a new city   maybe maybe not   by from purchasing the apartment now you are able to save up more cash over the next two years and you wo n't have an apartment tying you down   with the money you save by not taking the personal loan you 'll have enough cash for a down payment for an apartment wherever your new master 's degree takes you

i like the way you framed this question   there is no single right answer for what to do with your savings but there are some choices that are wrong in the sense that they are dominated by other choices you could make   of the choices you listed there are two that fall into that category   the ones that seem like a bad idea to me are putting it into your roth 401(k   you ca n't do this directly anyhow but you could do it indirectly by increasing your contributions and using the growth fund to cover the hole in your budget but that 's a lot of work for a relatively small gain   you would essentially be exchanging one long term investment for another long term investment   you would pay capital gains taxes on the investment when you sell it today in order to not pay taxes on its earnings when you eventually withdraw it   there is some benefit there but it 's a long way off not that large and probably not worth the effort   things that might change your mind   if your 401(k was a traditional 401(k paying tax at capital gains rate today to get a deduction at your normal income rate is likely to be a win   you 're not contributing enough to get the full company match always try to get that match if you can putting it into your emergency fund   once again you are likely to pay capital gains tax if you do this and you will be putting it into an investment that is likely to get a lower return than your current one   it is n't really necessary to incur these costs since if you encounter an emergency that you ca n't cover with your existing emergency fund you could always liquidate the growth fund then when you know you need it   now a growth fund is going to be more volatile than what you would normally want for an emergency fund but the risk is n't that bad if you think about it   say your emergency comes up and you find that the growth fund is down 20 which would be a pretty horrible run   that 's $ 600 less that you have to deal with the situation   keep in mind that you already have $ 2000 and building in your current emergency fund   is that $ 600 going to make the difference between meeting the need and not   it 's not likely   better to leave the investment where it is and keep building your emergency fund week by week   things that might change your mind your level of risk aversion if having that money in a more risky investment is keeping you up at night move it   you face significant job uncertainty if you have reason to think your job is at risk it might be a good idea to top off that emergency fund sooner rather than later your other two choices both seem like solid options under the right circumstances   if it were me i 'd leave the investment in place rather than use it to pay off the student loan   the investment is likely though of course not guaranteed to earn more than the interest rate even on the highest rate loan especially when you consider that the interest on the student loan is probably tax deductible   moreover the size of the investment is n't enough to fully repay the loan so putting it toward the loan wo n't even improve your cash flow for some time to come   however there is always a chance that the investment will perform poorly and some people prefer the guaranteed return from paying off the loan   it depends on your personal risk tolerance   the one thing i would recommend is to think of putting the money toward the loan not as a debt repayment but as a fixed income investment with a yield equal to your loan 's interest rate   if you would still consider buying it then then go ahead   if not then stick with what you 've got   in my experience people get way too emotional about debt try to take that emotion out of your decision making if you can

options are contractual instruments most options you 'll run into are contracts which allow you to buy or sell stock at a given price at some time in the future if you feel like it it gives you the option these are call and put options respectively for buying the stock and selling the stock if you have a lot of money in an index fund etf you may be able to protect your portfolio against a market decline by e.g. buying put options against the etf for a substantially lower price than the index fund currently trades at if the market crashes and your fund falls in value significantly you can exercise the options selling the fund at the price that your option has specified to the counter party of your contract this is the risk that the option mitigates against even if you do n't have one particular fund with your investments you could still buy a put option on a similar fund and resell it to another person in lieu of exercise they would be capable of buying the stock and performing the exercise themselves for profit if necessary in general if you are buying an option for safety it should be an option either on something you own or something whose price behavior will mimic something you own you will note that options are linked to the price of stocks futures are contracts whose values are linked to the price of other things typically commodities such as oil gold or orange juice their behaviors may diverge with an option you can have a contractual guarantee on the exact investment you 're trying to protect additionally many commodities value may fall at the same time that stock investments fall during economic contractions which reduce industrial activity resulting in lower profits for firms and less demand for commodities you may also note that there are other structures that options may have put options on index funds or similar instruments are probably most specifically relevant to your interests the downside of protecting yourself with options is that it costs money to buy this option and the option eventually expires so you may lose money essentially you are buying safety and risk tolerance from the option contract 's counterparty and safety is not free i can not inform you what level of safety is appropriate for your portfolio 's needs but more safety is more expensive

if by investment you mean something that pays you money that you can spend then no but if you view investment as something that improves your balance sheet net worth by reducing debt and reducing how much money you 're throwing away in interest each month then the answer is definitely yes paying down debt is a good investment to improve your overall financial condition however your home mortgage might not be the first place to start looking for pay downs to save money   credit cards typically have much higher interest rates than mortgages so you would save more money by working on eliminating your credit card debt first i believe suze orman said something like if you found an investment that paid you 25 interest would you take it   of course you would   paying down high interest debt reduces the amount of interest you have to pay next month   your same amount of income will be able to go farther do more because you 'll be paying less in interest pay off your credit card debt first and keep it off then pay down your mortgage a few hundred dollars in extra principal paid in the first few years of a 30 year mortgage can remove years of interest payments from the mortgage term whether you plan to keep your home for decades or you plan to move in 10 years having less debt puts you in a stronger financial position

some of the other answers recommended peer to peer lending and property markets i would not invest in either of these firstly peer to peer lending is not a traditional investment and we may not have enough historical data for the risk to return ratio secondly property investments have a great risk unless you diversify which requires a huge portfolio crowd funding for one property is not a traditional investment and may have drawbacks for example what if you disagree with other crowd about the required repairs for the property if you invest in the property market i recommend a well diversified fund that owns many properties beware of high debt leverage used to enhance returns and at the same time risk and high fees when selecting a fund however traditionally it has been a better choice to invest in stocks than to invest in property market beware of anyone who says that the property market is too good to not get into without specifying which part of the world is meant note also that many companies invest in properties so if you invest only in a well diversified stock index fund you may already have property investments in your portfolio however in your case i would keep the money in risk free assets i.e. bank savings or a genuine low cost money market fund i.e. one that does n't invest in corporate debt or in variable rate loans which have short duration but long maturity the reason is that you 're going to be unemployed soon and thus you may need the money soon if you have an investment horizon of say 10 years then i would throw stocks into the mix and if you 're saving for retirement then i would go all in to stocks in the part of the world where i live in money market funds generally have better return than bank savings and better diversification too however your 2.8 interest sounds rather high the money market fund i have in the past invested in currently yields at 0.02 but then again i live in the eurozone so be sure to get estimates for the yields of different risk free assets so my advice for investing is simple risk free assets for short time horizon a mixture of stocks and risk free assets for medium time horizon and only stocks for long time horizon in any case you need a small emergency fund too which you should consider a thing separate from your investments my emergency fund is 20 000 eur your 50 000 aud is bit more than 30 000 eur so you do n't really have that much money to invest only a bit more than a reasonably sized emergency fund but then again i live in rental property so my expenses are probably higher than yours if you can foresee a very long time horizon for part of your investment you could perhaps invest 50 of your money to stocks preference being a geographically diversified index fund or a number of index funds but i would n't invest more because of the need for an emergency fund

the general discussion of inflation centers on money as a medium of exchange and a store of value it is impossible to discuss inflation without considering time since it is a comparison between the balance between money and goods at two points in time the whole point of using money rather than bartering goods is to have a medium of exchange having money you are interested in the buying power of the money in general more than the relative price of a specific commodity if some supply distortion causes a shortage of tobacco or gasoline or rental properties the price of each will go up however if the amount of circulating money is doubled the price of everything will be bid up because there is more money chasing the same amount of wealth the persons who get to introduce the additional circulating money will win at the expense of those who already hold cash most of the public measures that are used to describe the economy are highly suspect for example during the 90s the federal government ceased using a constant market basket when computing cpi allowing with this it was no longer possible to make consistent comparisons over time the so called core cpi is even worse as it excludes food and energy which is fine provided you do n't eat anything or use any energy therefore when discussing cpi it is important to understand what exactly is being measured and how most published statistics understate inflation

if your sole proprietorship losses exceed all other sources of taxable income then you have what 's called a net operating loss nol you will have the option to carry back and amend a return you filed in the last 2 years where you owed tax or you can carry forward the losses and decrease your taxes in a future year up to 20 years in the future for more information see the irs links for nol note it 's important to make sure you file the nol correctly so i 'd advise speaking with an accountant especially if the loss is greater than the cost of the accountant

it comes down to liability if a fraudulent transaction takes place with a debit card you are out $ $ until it is resolved while as with a credit card the credit lender is out $ $ the credit lender does not like losing $ $ and therefore would like to be paid extra $ $ for assuming this risk and they found the merchant as the one most willing to pay sometimes the merchant will pass on this cost to the consumer but often times the credit card company has a contract with the merchant preventing such a fee because then they would be at a price disadvantage when compared to debit

you want a fee only advisor   he charges like an architect or plumber by the hour or some other flat fee that is his only compensation he is not paid on commission at all   he is not affiliated with any financial services company of any kind    his office is starbucks   he does not have a well lit office like the commission broker down the street   he does not want you to hand him your money it stays in the brokerage account of your choice within reason some brokerage accounts are terrible and he 'll tell you to get out of those   he never asks for the password to your brokerage account   edit the uk recently outlawed commission brokers   these guys were competitive sales types who thrive on commissions and probably went into other sales jobs   so right now everyone is clamoring for the few proper financial advisors available   high demand is making them expensive   it may not be cost effective to hire an advisor you may need to learn it yourself   it 's not that hard   ever hear of a plumber who works totally for free and makes his money selling you wildly overpriced pipe   that 's what regular financial advisors are    they sell products that are deliberately made unnecessarily complex the purpose is first to conceal sales commissions and high internal fees and second to confuse you so the financial world feels so daunting that you feel like you need their help just to navigate it    they 're trying to fry your brain so just give up and trust them    products like whole life and variable annuities are only the poster children for how awful all of their financial products are   these products exist to fleece the consumer without quite breaking the law   of course everyone goes to see them because they have well lit offices in every town and they 're free and easy to deal with do n't feel like you need to know everything about finance to invest   you do n't need to understand every complex financial product that the brokerage houses dreamed up they are designed to conceal and confuse as i discuss above and you do n't want them   the core of it is fairly simple and that 's all you really need to know    look at any smaller university and how they manage their endowments if whole life annuities and those complex financial products actually worked university endowments would be full of them    but they 're not   endowments are generally made of investments you can understand   partly because university boards are made of investment bankers who invented those products and know what a ripoff they are    some people refuse to learn anything   they are done with college and refuse to learn anything more    i hope that 's not you    because you should learn the workings of everything you 're investing in     if you do n't understand it do n't buy   and a fee only financial advisor wo n't ask you to   1000 well well advised university endowments seek the most successful products on the market and end up choosing products you can understand   that 's good news for you

it very much depends on whether you want to drive around in an expensive car or whether you want an expensive car parked on your driveway and whether you want to buy a new car or a used one and whether you know a reliable garage that does n't rip you off or not   for example if my wife who drives maybe 5,000 miles a year wanted a 5 series bmw we could buy a five year old one with 120,000 miles for about £ 120 per month purchase price if it lasts 6 years 11 year old and 150,000 miles should be no problem for that kind of car so that 's quite affordable for me driving 25,000 miles a year the numbers are quite different   fact is if you drive around in my wider neighbourhood you will sometimes see very expensive cars parked in front of very rundown houses some people find it more important to drive around in an expensive car than to live in a nice place that 's priorities many people can afford expensive cars if they their priorities and i 'm not saying it 's a good thing   ps if you want to be seen in an expensive car for example you take your wife out you can always rent a car for a day or two

most patterns can be used on various time frames for example you could use candle stick reversal patterns on monthly charts weekly charts daily charts or intra day charts like one hour or even one minute charts obviously if you are looking for longer term positions you would be looking at daily weekly or monthly charts and if you are looking for shorter term positions you would be looking at intra day to daily charts   you can also use a combination of time frames for example if you are trying to enter a trade over a long term uptrend you could use a weekly chart to determine if the stock is currently uptrending and then use a daily chart to time your entry into the trade most patterns in general do n't really determine how long you will be in the trade but instead usually can provide an entry trigger a stop loss location and possibly a profit target   so in general a pattern which is being used to enter into longer term trades on weekly charts can also be used to enter shorter term trades on intra day charts

a yes it does accomplish the goal of adding more money but the money is in lieu of any return you can earn while the loan is outstanding if you somehow knew exactly which periods where going to run negative and you took a 401k loan during that time you 'd be in pretty good shape but if you had that information you 'd probably be ruling the world in short order and would n't care much about a measly 401k b it 's a nice idea but unfortunately you are not allowed to set your own interest rate if you could your idea would work perfectly the interest rate is bank specific and is typically 1 2 points over prime but if your plan was to leave your money sitting in cash or low interest bearing accounts anyway the loan does actually achieve the goal of getting more money in there though it 's your money you are n't earning it

boomers have also bid up the prices of a lot of things everything from stocks to housing simply because they as a bulge were all attempting to in the aggregate buy basically the same things at essentially the same time   basically a lot of demand chasing and driving a supply this often made the previously acquired assets i.e. the early boomer contingent who got there amp bought in first appear to increase quickly in price   the opposite effect will happen as they retire die off either they or their heirs will choose or need to sell off their various accumulated assets   then suddenly the supply will begin to bulge instead selling off portfolios of stocks even required as pensions need to be paid or as boomers reach + 70 1/2 and are mandated by law to begin selling off amp cashing in specific 's of their 401 k and ira holdings and likewise with housing aging boomers will downsize selling off the which they never really needed and which in retirement will be burdensome to maintain and trying to move into or selling off the several second amp third vacation homes   end result will be a big dump of supply of housing onto the market a supply that genx does not have the demographic numbers to consume and which it does not appear the frugal minded genx even want to buy at anything like the same rates the boomers did even if they were capable of paying the price which it also appears they can not having been in career amp salary gains by the bulge of boomers in positions above before them and then the echo boomers which while larger than x are not the equivalent of the original boomers and who are carrying an huge house sized debt load but minus the house and in many cases as debt which can not be erased as it is in student loan form from the beginning of their careers in which they are being paid significantly less than previous generations and who are delaying and then limiting the formation of households as a result   and that is just how demographic play out it was all entirely predictable and was in fact predicted by many

banks can not just borrow from the federal reserve and use that money to make loans the first thing you need to understand is how fractional reserve banking works the banks can make loans with money that their customers have deposited in their accounts the interest and fees from those loans go to pay the salaries of those working at the banks with leftover profit to pay dividends interest on your bank accounts   the only reason that the federal reserve allows overnight lending is so that banks do n't immediately become insolvent if they have larger than usual withdrawals by their depositors the federal reserve keeps an eye on the balance sheets of the banks that are doing the borrowing and if they did n't have assets in the form of deposits they would force the banks to sell the loans that were made from those deposits what does this have to do with personal finance i think this question is only marginally on topic here this amount of money in circulation is affected specifically by the fraction of the money that can be used for making other loans but the bigger influence is the rate that the federal reserve charges for overnight lending they raise and lower the rates which affects the rates that the banks can lend at while remaining profitable

i think your question is pretty wise and the comments indicate that you understand the magnitude of the situation    first off there could be nothing that your friend could do   step parent relationships can be strained and this could make it worse add the age of the girl and grief and he could make this a lot worse then it potentially is   she may spend it all to spite step dad secondly there is a need to understand by all involved that personal finance is about 75 90 behavior   very high income people can wind up bankrupt and lower income people can end up wealthy   the difference between two people 's success or failure often boils down to behavior    thirdly i think you understand that there needs to be a why not only a what to do   i think that is the real tricky part   there has to be a teaching component along with an okay this is what you should do    finding a person will be difficult   first off there is not a lot of money involved   good financial advisers handle much larger cash positions and this young lady will probably need to spend some of it down   secondly most are willing to provide a cookie cutter solution to the problem at hand   this will likely leave a bad taste in the daughter 's mouth    if it was me i would encourage two things both of those things buy time   if she comes out of this with an education in a career field with a 50 60 k starting salary a nice used car and no student loans that would be okay   i would venture to say mom would be happy    if she is very savvy she might be able to come out of this with a down payment on a place of her own or if she has education all locked up perhaps purchasing a home for mostly cash    in the interim period a search for a good teaching fa could occur   finding such a person could also help you and your friend in addition to the daughter   now my own step daughter and i have a good financial relationship   there are other areas where our relationship can be strained but as far as finances we relate well   we took financial peace university   $ 100 offered through many local churches together when she was at the tender age of 16   the story of ben and arthur really spoke to her and we have had many subsequent conversations on the matter   that may work in this case a youtube video on part of the lesson

this is possible   in fact in the cases of debt settlement the collection companies typically issue a 1099 for the difference on what is owed and what is settled making that taxable income   so the irs sees it as income in the us however this kind of dishonesty is not conducive to building long term wealth or wealth of significant means     as others have said this is fraud but provided that one is truthful on the loan application it would be impossible to prove   how can one prove that a person has no intention of paying a loan back doing this once or twice may ruin your ability to receive a loan for legitimate purposes for life

you can calculate your exposure intuitively by calculating your fx sensitivity take your total usd assets let 's assume $ 50k convert to eur at the current rate let 's assume 1 eur 1.1 usd resulting in eur if the usd strengthens by 1 this moves to a rate of resulting in eur value for the same 50k of usd investments from this you can see that for every 1 the usd strengthens you gain 500 eur for every 1 the usd weakens you lose 500 eur the simplest way to reduce your exchange rate risk exposure is to simply eliminate your foreign currency investments ie if you do not want to be exposed to fluctuations in the usd invest in eur only this will align your assets with the currency of your future expenses assuming you intend to continue living in is not possible of course if you would like to maintain investments in us assets   one relatively simple method available to invest in the us without gaining an exposure to the usd is to invest in usd assets only with money borrowed in usd ie if you borrow $ 50k usd and invest $ 50k in the us stock market then your new investments will be in the same currency as your debt therefore if the usd strengthens your assets increase in relative eur value and your debt becomes more expensive these two impacts wash out leaving you with no net exposure to the value of the usd there is a risk to this option you are investing with a higher financial leverage ratio using borrowed money to invest increases your risk if your investments fall in value you still need to make the periodic interest payments many people view this increased risk as a reason to never invest with borrowed money you are compensated for that risk by increased returns because you have the ability to earn investment income without contributing any additional money of your own whether the risk is worth it to you will depend on many factors you should search this site and others on the topic to learn more about what those risks mean

a rule of thumb i like to follow when purchasing things from cl listed well below value is this assess the level of of the seller people living in poor neighborhoods are much more likely to try and hide things that would deter buyers as they are more likely to need the money i find that when i go to a big house with 4 cars in the driveway the seller is more likely to be honest because she likely does n't need the money from the sale   edit i seem to have the pc police with this answer this is based on facts and statistics not my opinion i have no bias against poor people

is there some evidence in the article or elsewhere that the purpose is to kill off these competitors rather than simply to compete   competition is normally considered good in these kinds of situations as it out better efficiencies for which an argument can be made here but taking actions specifically for the purpose of killing off competition is not good because it reduces the pressures on efficiencies   killing off competition by artificially lowering prices below real market value is considered dumping but i do n't really see evidence of that in the article is there some hidden somewhere or is the article just trying to make a point without any basis   i do have concerns about the amazon play but sensationalist or bias driven reporting wo n't help me puzzle through them

i empathize honestly but we ca n't address claims like gt;that when the cards are so stacked against you and when all jobs available to you are not paying a living wage   at a generalized societal level   everyone is an individual that makes individual choices that affect the outcomes in their life   i would assume there were some along the way if every available job does not pay a livable wage whatever that may be not trying to be a dick but honestly what does that phrase even mean   those in life such as not graduating high school or having a kid without a partner and before being financially self sufficient or getting into trouble with the law etc etc are going to make life more difficult for one than the person that did n't make those mistakes     i think that is fair   some people have great parents   some people have shitty parents   the former will have the opportunity assuming they do n't fuck it up for an easier life than the latter   that 's just life man   if you have shitty parents hopefully that will motivate you to make better life choices than your parents did so that your kid does n't have shitty parents    the kid that stayed home to study for his exams and missed all the parties should be rewarded for that behavior and often times they are via better paying jobs and financial security in the future    is the system perfect   of course not nothing is   but in the history of mankind we 've never had a better system that has pulled   more people out of poverty produced more advancement in the standard of living or given people more freedom over their own lives

why not ask a fee only financial adviser contact a local adviser and ask how much they will charge to work through the process   the options are n't as complex as they seem the general idea is to first figure out what you can afford each month this is a generally straight forward calculation   then figure out the costs that are specific to your area e.g property taxes   figure out how much of a down payment costs you can gather   then start with your local bank or credit union the number of options for mortgages will not be as complex if you already know how much you can afford and how much cash you can bring to the transaction a simple table can be easily created based on what you can afford each month how much cash you have and the rates currently available the bank will have a way to estimate the costs of each option as part of the required disclosures another source of good info can be a highly regarded local real estate agent focus on one that will represent you as a purchaser they want you to be able to buy a house while they do have a bias they want a commission most of it is eliminated if you know how much you can afford before you meet with them they will know all the government programs that can make the monthly costs or closing costs cheaper

to answer your question yes it 's often worth it to have investments that produce income do a google search for income vs growth investing and you 'll get a sense for two different approaches to investing in equities in a nutshell growth stocks think netflix etc do n't pay dividends but are poised to appreciate in price more than income stocks think banks utilities etc that tend to have less volatile prices but pay a consistent dividend in the long run decades growth stocks tend to outperform income stocks that 's why younger investors tend to pick growth stocks while those closer to retirement tend to stick with more stable income producing portfolio but there 's nothing wrong with a mixed approach either i agree with pete 's answer too

a huge amount of money in all financial markets is from institutional investors such as mutual funds government pension plans sovereign wealth funds etc   for various reasons these funds do all of their trading at the end of the day   they care primarily that their end of day balances are in line with their targets and are easy to audit and far less about timing the market for the best possible trades so if you 're looking at a stock that is owned by many institutional investors such as a stock like aapl that makes up a significant portion of an index that many funds track there will be a huge amount of activity at this time relative to stocks that are less popular among institutions even just in its introduction this paper pdf gives a fair overview of other reasons why there 's a lot of trading at end of day in general in fact because of all this closing activity and the reliance on end of day prices as for financial calculations the end of day has for decades been the single most fraud ridden time of the trading day   electronic trading has done away with a lot of the straight up that floor traders and brokers used to get away with at the expense of the public but it still exists   see for example any explanation of the term the close or the penalties against 6 banks just last month for manipulating the fx market at the close

i have n't seen anything specifically about how paypal operates but my guess is that they maintain relationships with banks in many countries via affiliates and they settle the money transfers internally within the paypal system you basically have two types of bank transfers there are others as well that i 'm not getting into i think paypal is a hybrid they send and receive money using drafts to keep costs down and manage the international stuff by operating a proprietary network so if you send money from indonesia to the us you pay paypal indonesia who then tells paypal usa to issue funds to your recipient so they are cheaper than a wire faster than a check but limited in terms of transaction size and some other factors

it is not clear to me why you believe you can lose more than you put in without margin it is difficult and the chances are virtually nil however i can think of a few ways lets say you are an american and deposit $ 1000 now lets say you think the indian rupee is going to devalue relative to the euro so that means you want to go long going long without margin is still different than converting your into euros assume = 72 what s actually happening is your broker is taking out a 72,000 rupee loan and using it to buy euros with your $ 1000 acting as collateral you will need to pay interest on this loan about 7 annualized if i remember correctly you will earn interest on the euros you hold in the meantime for simplicity lets say its 1 the difference between interest you earn and interest you pay is called the cost of carry or commonly referred to as swap so your annualized cost of carry is $ 60 $ lets say you have this position open for 1 year and the exchange rate does nt move your total equity is $ now lets say an destroys all of europe your euros instantly become worthless you now must repay the rupee loan to close the trade the cost of which is $ 1000 but you only have $ in your account you have lost more than you deposited using no margin i would actually say that all buying and selling of currency pairs is inherently using margin because they all involve a short sale i do note that depending on your broker you can convert to another currency but that s not what forex traders do most of the time

to add on to the other answers in asking why funds have different price points one might be asking why stocks are n't normalized so a unit price of $ in one stock can be directly compared to the same price in another stock   while this might not make sense with aapl vs. goog it would be like comparing apples to oranges pun intended not to mention how would two different companies ever come to such an agreement it does seem like it would make more sense when tracking an index   and in fact less agreement between different funds would be required as some natural price points exist such as dividing by 100 like some s&p funds do however there are a couple of reasons why two different funds might price their shares of the same underlying index differently demand if there are a lot of people wanting the issue more shares might be issued at a lower price   or there might be a lot of demand centered on a certain price range pricing shares that are priced higher will find fewer buyers because it makes it harder to buy round lots 100 shares at $ 100/share is $ 10,000 while at $ 10/share it 's only $ 1000   while not everyone buys stock in lots it 's important if you do anything with standardized options on the stock because they are always acting on lots   in addition even if you do n't buy round lots a higher price makes it harder to buy in for a specific amount because each unit share has a greater chance to be further away from your target amount conversely shares that are priced too low will also find fewer buyers because some holders have minimum price requirements due to low price e.g. penny stocks to be more speculative and volatile so different funds tracking the same index might pick different price points to satisfy demand that is not being filled by other funds selling at a different price point

anything related to the central bank will have a large impact as they are the ones who determine interest rates and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows   gdp is also important as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity the opposite is also true large increases in gdp may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed inflation data is also very important again large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates this data typically is in the form of cpi note that each central bank is different they all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on the federal reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data especially wage inflation data and employment significant deviations in these data points from what s expected by investors can greatly move the market however these specific factors are a little less important for say mexico which is mostly concerned with headline inflation read the statements issued by the central banks to find out what s important to them central banks also issue expectations for things like growth cpi etc if these expectations are not met it may result in a policy change or at least talk of a policy change at the next meeting of the central bank anticipating these policy changes and trading accordingly is one strategy to be a profitable forex trader also there are several forex news calendars online that indicate what is likely to be high impact news these can be helpful starting out

there are some assumptions which can be made in terms of the flexibility you have i will start with the least flexible assumption and then move to more flexible assumptions if you must put down a number 1 your go to for the start period to 1 is pretty good and it 's used frequently for other divide by zero calculations like in a video game the problem i have with 1 is that it does n't allow you to handle various scales   some problems are dealt with in thousands some in fractions and some in hundreds of millions therefore you should change the start period to the smallest significantly measurable number you could reasonably have here that would take your example 0 and and give you an increase of it 's not a great result but it 's the best you can hope for if you have to put down a number   and it allows you to keep some of the meaning in the change if you absolutely must put something this is the assumption that most answers have taken you can put down a symbol a number with a notation empty space etc but there is going to be a label somewhere called growth that will exist i generally agree with what i 've seen particularly the answers from benjamin and for the sake of preservation those answers can be summarized as putting n a or possibly with a footnote and if you can avoid the measurement entirely the root of your question is what do my manager and investors expect to see i think it 's valuable to dig even further to what do my manager and investors really want to know they want to know the state of their investment growth is often a good measurement of that state but in cases where you are starting from zero or negative it just does n't tell you the right information in these situations you should avoid growth and instead talk in absolute terms which mention the time frame or starting state for example

mostly ditto to sarwate let me just add i do n't know how you 're making your payments whether through the biller 's web site your bank 's web site by mail in person etc but whatever the mechanism if there is a chance that waiting until the due date to pay may mean that you will miss the due date do n't the cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings bear in mind that we are talking pennies here i do n't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to say it 's $ 3,000 i think that would be a lot for most people you say you 're getting 3.6 on your savings so if on the average you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have you 're getting an extra 2 52 x 3.6 x $ 3,000 in interest or $ 4 per month i think the last time i paid a late fee on a credit card it was $ 35 so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings   personally i pay most of my bills through either my bank 's web site or the biller 's web site i schedule all payments when i get a paycheck and i generally try to schedule them for 1 week before the due date so there 's plenty of breathing room

when you start living in us it does n't actually matter what was your credit history in another country your credit history in us is tied to your ssn social security number which will be awarded once you are in the country legally and apply for it getting an ssn also does n't guarantee you nothing and you have to build your credit history slowly opening a checking or savings account will not help you in building a credit history you need to have some type of credit account credit card car loan mortgage etc linked to your ssn to start building your credit history when you are new to us you probably wo n't find any bank that will give you a credit card as you have no credit history one alternative is to apply for a secured credit card a secured credit card is one you get by putting money or paying money to a bank and open a credit card against that money thereby the bank can be secure that they wo n't lose any money once you have that you can use that to build up your credit history slowly and once you have a good credit history and score apply for regular credit card or apply for a car loan mortgage etc when i came to us 8 years ago my credit history was nothing even though i had pretty good balance and credit history back in my country i applied for secured credit card by paying $ 500 to a bank which got acquired by capitalone got it approved and used it for everything for three years i applied for other cards in the mean time but got rejected every time finally got approved for a regular credit card after three years and in one year added a mortgage and car loan which helped me to get a decent score now and yes a good credit score is important and essential for renting an apartment leasing a car getting a credit card etc   but normally your employer can always arrange for an apartment given your situation or you need to share apartment with someone else you can rent a car without and credit score but need a valid us international drivers license and a credit card best option will be to open a secured credit card and start building your credit when your wife and family arrives they also will be assigned individual ssn and can start building their credit history themselves please keep in mind that credit score and credit history is always individual here

what does it mean that the bank will hold you responsible clearly    the money wo n't be credited will you be charged a fee like an nsf    cheque will they try to prosecute you is there any way to confirm whether a cashiers cheque is forged could you for example tell your bank that you were uncertain of the origin and ask them to confirm it can you call the issuer and verify from the serial number that they did in fact issue a cheque for that amount with you as the payee even calling the bank might not help the first verification is that the bank exists and that the account number and name match and that they did issue a check but that does n't cover the situation where the person that sent you the check was n't who they claimed to be that is the theft that could take weeks to find

chinese suppliers can quote their price in cny rather than usd as has been typical and thus avoid the exchange risk from us dollar the cny has been generally appreciating so committing to receive payments in us dollars when their costs are in cny means they are typically on the losing end of the equation and they have to pad their prices a bit   canadian importers will have to buy rmb typically with cad to pay for their orders and canadian exporters can take payment in rmb if they wish or set prices in cad by avoiding the us dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs japan did this many decades ago they too used to price their products in usd   this is important in transactions of large amounts not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism two way annual trade between china and canada is in excess of $   of course forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for the world forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade all that trading in currency and financial instruments means more jobs on bay street and more money flowing into a very vital part of the canadian economy   recent article from the liberal toronto star here

the best advice i can give you is to ignore gold right now you really do n't and ca n't have all the information you would need to support an argument for shorting gold   how much fiat cash have the central banks injected into the word economy billions trillions tens of trillions maybe not much at all as the banks repay overnight    anyway without going on a full on rant why would you touch gold on a short i can understand speculating on long position based on all the news out there but i 'd hesitate to be a in this market   just find a nice little company that makes money has a good product and a pretty little balance sheet it will take longer to research but fuck if i 'm betting on a huge drop in gold any time soon   what reasons do you have to believe gold is headed for any significant slide

i would be very cautious about investing any more funds into the s&p500 at this stage you are quite correct in your observation with the charts regarding the 2001 and 2008 crashes and below is the chart of the s&p500 over the last 20 years with some indicators on it   the green line on the price chart is the 100 week moving average ma and the pink line below the price chart is the moving average of the rate of change roc indicator in general the market is moving up if price is above the 100 week ma and the roc is above 0 and versa the market is moving down if price is below the 100 week ma and the is below 0 both times in 2001 and in 2008 when prices broke below the 100 week ma and then the roc crossed below the zero line well we all know what happened next in 2001 prices kept falling and the roc did n't cross back above zero for about 2.5 years in 2008 much the same happened and the roc did n't cross back above zero for over 20 months now as we are reaching the end of 2015 prices have once again broken below the 100 week ma and the roc is just above the zero line quickly heading down towards it if you have a 5 to 8 year time frame and prices do continue to fall much further after the roc crosses below the zero line your current funds and any new funds you invest in this etf will potentially see heavy losses for the next one to two years and then take another year to two years or more to recover to current levels this means that your funds will potentially have no gains at all in 5 or 6 years time a better option is to get out of the market once the roc crosses below zero and then look to get back in once the recovery has started when the roc crosses back above the zero line you might be out of the market for a year or two but once you get back in you can expect robust gains over the next 3 to 5 years if you do get out and things reverse quite quickly you can easily just get back in in and the price broke below the 100 week ma but the roc remained above zero and prices continued moving up after short corrections in the roc got very close to the zero line but did not cross below it and again prices continued to go up after a small correction you should plan for the worst and be ready if it occurs if you do n't plan you 're just hoping and hoping is what will keep you awake at night things are going against you

a few years ago there was a tv special with a celebrity chef i think tyler that was trying to get a small town to eat healthier in one segment he showed kids how processed chicken nuggets were made which was some chicken trimmings and the leftover bones and all mixed with bread crumbs and strained and this was supposedly supposed to be disgusting especially to kids did n't work they still wanted chicken nuggets   in the end there 's nothing wrong with using the gross parts of an animal nor is there any thing wrong with some of the processing techniques mostly they 're used to get the most out of the animal which is what we should be doing americans especially are incredibly turned off by any meat that is n't pure white which is ridiculous dark meat and are used around the world and are seen as chemicals are used to scare people but there 's nothing inherently wrong with them heck cooking developed as a way to find more interesting uses for chemicals and additives   you 'll find no bigger supporter of home cooking and eating whole foods than i am but there is way too much fear mongering and that 's based only on arbitrary perceptions of what 's acceptable and what is n't you could probable start a campaign of outrage against tortillas for using lime or bacon for using nitrites or fish for being frozen all because people are gullible and ignorant on where their food comes from

not true the language used in the navy amp army clauses are different there is a duty to maintain the navy and support the armies there is no such mandate in the postal clause nor can the act of establishing be read as implying maintenance because the constitution specifically includes those things for the army and navy suggesting it was not implied    you can establish something and then privatize it government chartered companies were common at the time so it 's not like the idea did n't occur to them    strictly speaking i do n't see any reason that congress could n't also privatize the army and navy assuming that maintain and support do n't imply direct congressional control but that 's a harder argument compared to this much easier distinction in the case of the post office

when evaluating a refinance it all comes down to the payback refinancing costs money in closing costs there are different reasons for refinancing and they all have different methods for calculating payback   one reason to finance is to get a lower interest rate when determining the payback time you calculate how long it would take to recover your closing costs with the amount you save in interest for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one the longer you hold the mortgage after you refinance the more money you save in interest with the new rate generally it does n't pay to refinance to a lower rate right before you sell because you are n't holding the mortgage long enough to see the interest savings you seem to be 3 years away from selling so you might be able to see some savings here in the next three years   a second reason people refinance is to lower their monthly payment if they are having trouble paying it i see you are considering switching from a 15 year to a 30 year is one of your goals to reduce your monthly payment by refinancing to a 30 year you 'll be paying a lot of interest in your first few years of payments extending the payback time of your lower interest rate   a third reason people refinance is to pull cash out of their equity this applies to you as well since you are planning on using it to remodel the home you are trying to sell you have to ask yourself if the renovations you are planning will payoff in the increased sale price of your home often renovations do n't increase the value of their home as much as they cost you do renovations because you will enjoy living in the renovated home and you get some of your money back when you sell but sometimes you can increase the value of your home by enough to cover the cost of the renovation talk to a real estate agent in your area to get their advice on how much the renovations you are talking about will increase the value of your home

although i do n't think you need to factor in risk tolerance to get the probabilities i agree with joetaxpayer that you will need to factor in risk tolerance in order to make a practical decision about what to do   in fact i think that to make a practical decision you will need more than the specific probability you ask for you in the question rather you would like to see the complete probability distribution of possible outcomes in other words it 's not enough to know that there is a 51 chance that investing will outperform paying down debt   you actually need to know much it outperforms when it does outperform and how much it underperforms when it underperforms   as joetaxpayer 's comment suggests you might not choose to make an investment that had a 99 chance of outperforming debt payment by 1 and a 1 chance of underperforming by 99 i think it possible to address these questions by doing simulations   this can be done even with a spreadsheet but more flexibly with simple programming   essentially you can create some kind of probabilistic model of the various factors e.g. chance that your investment will go up or down and see what actually happens how often you lose a lot of money lose a little money gain a little money or gain a lot of money   then based on that you can consult your inner spirit animal to decide whether the probability distribution of possible gains outweighs that of possible losses

why should a bank get into construction specifically lots of business opportunities require capital conceivably banks could build factories develop consumer electronics complete with spacex etc it 's all capital in profits out with varying levels of risk and returns there 's nothing special about constructing apartments the reason banks do n't run businesses is because there are plenty of private firms that compete with each other for business what 's the chance that a bank with all its bureaucracy can deliver cheaper apartments than an apartment developer pretty low in fact and that 's why they would rather lend to an apartment developer rather than building the apartments themselves banks are in the business of competing with other banks the main work they do is to sort out good investments from poor ones and if they can do that just a bit more efficiently than their competitors they make big bucks for example it might only take a few additional hours to better vet a deal worth millions whereas with an apartment building you would n't be able to make that amount of money per hour even if the materials and labor cost you nothing

it is not unheard of celebrity investors such as warren buffet and carl icahn gained by more than doubling investments some years with a few very stellar trades and bets doubling as in a 100 gain is actually conservative if you want to play that game as 500 1200 and greater gains are possible and were achieved by the two otherwise unrelated people i mentioned this reality is opposite of the comparably pitiful returns that warren buffet teaches baby boomers about but compounding on 2 5 gains annually is a more likely way to build wealth it is unreasonable to say and expect that you will get the outcome of doubling an investment year over year

it depends what you mean by gain over long period of times the market increases so using a blind monkey with a dart or index fund should be sufficient to get an average returns the key difference is that changes in currency are close to zero sum game while money in equity or bonds is actually used for something building a company etc if you mean get above average returns then you will likely get answers depending on person if you think that markets are efficient then you wo n't beat the market consistently over long periods the returns are likely to be no better then average because of large number of smart people trying to beat each other and even them are likely to have below average returns if you do n't think so then it is possible to get above average consistently as long as you know how to beat those smart people

the point of what you heard is likely that gold is thought by some to hold its value well when the money market would provide negative interest rates these negative interest rates are a sign of deflation where cash money is worth more in the future than it is today   normally under inflation cash money is worth less in the future than it is today under normal circumstances where inflation exists interest paid by the bank on money held there generally keeps up with inflation + a little bit extra now we are seeing many banks offering interest rates in the negatives which is an acknowledgement of the fact that money will be worth more in the future than it is today so in that sense holding physical gold fights deflation or negative interest rates in the same way that holding physical cash does because if you hold onto a $ 10k bundle of bills in 10 years you can walk into a bank and it will be worth $ 10k in future dollars which in a deflationary market would be more than it is worth today some view gold as being better at doing this than just holding cash but that discussion gets into an analysis of the value of paper money as a currency which is outside the scope of this answer   suffice to say i do not personally like the idea of buying gold as an investment but some do and partly for this reason

try using technical analysis look at the charts and look for stocks that are uptrending the of an uptrend being higher highs and higher lows use a stochastic indicator and buy on the dips down when the stochastic is in the oversold position below 20 and and crossing over about to turn back upwards or you can also use the stochastic to trade shares that have been ranging between two prices say between $ 10 and $ 12 for a while as the price approaches the $ 10 support and the stochastic is in oversold you would buy as the price rebounds off the $ 10 support and the stochastic crosses and starts back up as the price starts reaching the resistance at $ 12 with in overbought at above 80 you would look to sell and take profits if you were able to do short selling in the competition you could short sell at this point in time and make profits on the way up as well as on the way down there are many more techniques you could use to set up trade opportunities using technical analysis so it may be a subject you could research further before the begins good luck

though it seems you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock including the fact that it 's at its 52-week high and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it moving forward   if you think it 's going to go up even further   more than the return on your other options for where to put the money keep the stock   if you think it 's peaked and will be going down now 's a good time to sell to put it another way if you did n't already have this stock would you buy it today your choice is just about the same you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares or the shares    which do you think is worth more you also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio   some are probably a larger percentage than others and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio   it may be time to do some rebalancing which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large as a of your portfolio and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you 're not as invested in as you would like to be   this might be a good opportunity to increase the diversity in your portfolio if part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional not purely financial you could sell now mark it as a win and move on to another opportunity   trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance but not everybody is into trading or money for money 's sake   what 's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life   if holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns from emotion based trading is acceptable   as cqm points out you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires expires the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls

it does make sense to combine debts and pay off the worst highest interest rate however if you ca n't get any loan you should focus on the worst debt and pay that off then take the same amount of money you were paying to the next worse debt and so on until you 're clean let 's look at an example debt a is at 5 debt b is at 10 and debt c is at 15 you are paying ab and c. on a monthly basis you save 100 € to pay off c. once c is payed off you keep on saving 100 € and add whatever you were paying to debt c to those savings this way you can pay off debt b at an increased rate when b is cleared you save 100 € + whatever you were paying to debt b and debt c to clear debt a. that 's the theory

generally i would say that you should pay it off if you have the money available why pay interest if you have the money that is of course if your money can earn you more than the interest you pay which can happen if you got a very low apr for your car loan but then you probably have excellent credit already and should n't care about the history of the loan on your report re the 7 years vs 2 years to the best of my knowledge its not true it will stay 7 years even if its closed during the first year

i know of no way to answer your question without spamming a particular investment   first off if you are a usa citizen max out your whatever your employer matches will be an immediate boost to your investment   secondly you want your our gains to be tax deferred a 401-k is tax deferred as well as a traditional ira   thirdly you probably want the safety of diversification you achieve this by buying an etf or mutual fund that then buys individual stocks   now for the recommendation that may be called spamming by others as reits pass the tax liability on to you and as an ira is tax deferred you can get stellar returns by buying a etf   to get you started here are five   lastly avoid commissions by having your dividends automatically reinvested by using that feature at scottrade you will have to pay commissions on new purchases but your purchases from your dividend reinvestment will be commission free   edit taking my own advice i just entered orders to liquidate some positions so i would have the $ on hand to buy into and get some of that sweet 29 dividend return

after reading op mark 's question and the various answers carefully and also looking over some old pay stubs of mine i am beginning to wonder if he is mis reading his pay stub or slip of paper attached to the reimbursement check for the he purchases   pay stubs whether paper documents attached to checks or things received in one 's company mailbox or available for downloading from a company web site while the money is deposited electronically into the employee 's checking account vary from company to company but a reasonably well designed stub would likely have categories such as taxable gross income for the pay period this is the amount from which payroll taxes federal and state income tax social security and medicare tax are deducted as well as other post tax deductions such as money going to purchase of us savings bonds contributions to united way via payroll   deduction contribution to roth 401k etc employer paid group life   insurance premiums are taxable income too for any portion of the policy   that exceeds $ 50k. in some cases these appear as a lump sum on the last pay stub for the year nontaxable gross income for the pay period this would be sum total of the amounts contributed to 401k plans employee 's share of group health care insurance premiums for employee   and/or employee 's family money deposited into fsa accounts etc net pay this is the amount of the attached check or money sent via ach to the employee 's bank account year to date amounts these just tell the employee what has been earned paid withheld to date in the various categories now op mark said my company does not tax the reimbursement but they do add it to my running gross earnings total for the year so the question is whether the amount of the reimbursement is included in the year to date amount of taxable income if ytd taxable income does not include the reimbursement amount   then the the op 's question and the answers and comments are moot unless the company has really messed up pat pending payroll software that does weird things the amount   on the w2 form will be whatever is shown as ytd taxable income   on the last pay stub of the year and as noted it is what will appear on the w2 form that really matters in summary it is good that op mark is taking the time to investigate the matter of the reimbursements appearing in total gross income but if the amounts are not appearing in the ytd taxable income his payroll office may just him that they have good software and that what the ytd taxable income says on the last pay stub is what will be appearing on his w2 form   i am fairly confident that this is what will be the resolution of the matter because if the amount of the reimbursement was included in taxable income during that pay period and no tax was withheld then the employer has a problem with   social security and medicare tax and nonpayment of this tax plus the employer 's share to the us treasury in timely fashion the irs takes an extremely view of such shenanigans and most employers are unlikely to take the risk

k welcome to money se   you knew enough to add good tags to the question now you should search on the dozens of questions with those tags to understand in less than an hour far more than that banker knows about credit and credit scores   my advice is first never miss a payment ever the advice your father passed on to you is nonsense plain and simple i 'm just a few chapters shy of being able to write a book about the incorrect advice i 'd heard bank people give their customers the second bit of advice is that you do n't need to pay interest to have credit cards show good payment history i.e. if you choose to use credit cards use them for the convenience cash rebates tracking and guarantees they can offer pay in full each bill   last use a free service first annualcreditreport.com to get a copy of your credit report and then a service like credit karma for a simulated fico score and advice on how to improve it as member has commented discover not just for cardholders offers a look at your actual score as do a number of other credit cards for members   by the way i would n't be inclined to discuss this with dad most people take offense that you 'd believe strangers more than them most of the answers here are well documented with links to irs etc and if not quickly peer reviewed when i make a mistake a top rated member will correct me within a day if not just minutes

the signature actually back to the days before every business checked every transaction online when charge cards were introduced did n't exist nowadays stolen credit cards are usually reported within 24 hours and the card wo n't work businesses that face low fraud rates do n't bother checking they probably figure that a certain percentage of charges get charged back because the cardholder claims that they did n't make them and the credit card company usually just passes the cost on to the merchant so it 's really the merchant who should be worried about fraud since he or she is going to pay for it   the real question for the merchant is whether checking signatures actually reduces charge backs   if the credit card is stolen how hard would it be for thieves to practice the signature on the card a few times until they can reproduce it well enough to fool someone businesses that face high fraud rates are often more careful in new york city try buying some on street and you 'll get your signature checked your driver 's license checked and they 'll call up your 5th grade social studies teacher

only having 1200 dollars sounds extremely dangerous and in my opinion is not a sound situation to intentionally put yourself into    you have what 11k total that is roughly a rainy day fund depending on your expenses and clarity of cash flow i think you should keep that money in the bank as your new baseline at least 10k of it do n't touch that money unless you need to pay for an unexpected expense   now you have $ 0 to work with but a safe ish cushion    then and only then should any extra money be used for either paying down the loan or tax advantaged accounts a retirement account is probably the right long term financial choice however if it were me and i were back in that kind of situation i would pay off the loan first primarily for personal satisfaction then start maxing retirement contributions

in the question you cited i assumed immediate exercise that is why you understood that i was talking about 30 days after grant i actually mentioned that assumption in the answer sec 83(b does n't apply to options because options are not assets per se it only applies to restricted stocks so the 30 days start counting from the time you get the restricted stock which is when you early exercise as to the amt the iso spread will be considered amt income in the year of the exercise if you file the 83(b for it is ordinary income that 's the whole point of the election you can find more detailed explanation on this website

a falling $ aud would be beneficial to exporters and thus overall good for the economy if the economy improves and exporters start growing profits that means they will start to employ more people and employment will increase and with higher employment employees will become more confident to make purchases including purchasing property i feel the falling $ aud will be beneficial for the economy and the housing market however what you should consider is that with an improving economy and a rising property market it will only be a matter of time before interest rates start rising with a lower $ aud the will be more confident in starting to increase interest rates and increasing interest rates will have a effect on the housing market you are looking to buy a property to live in so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property i would assume at least for the medium to long term if this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet what you should be concerned about is that you do not on your borrowings make sure you allow a buffer of 2 to 3 above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments and if you get a fixed rate then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over regarding the telling you that property prices are going to crash well they were saying that in 2008 then again in 2010 then again in 2012 i do n't know about you but i have seen no crash sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have off and maybe gone down by 10 to 15 in some areas but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again it 's all part of the property cycle   i actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices the only way there will be a property crash in australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10 or higher but with good economic conditions an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in australia i see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase with falls up to 15 in some areas but no crash of 40 plus as i said above these periods of weakness actually provide opportunities to buy properties at a bit of a discount edit in your comments you say you intend to buy with a monthly mortgage repayment of $ 2500 in place of your current monthly rent of $ 1800 that means your loan amount would be somewhere around $ to $ you also mention you would be taking on a 5 year fixed rate and look to sell in about 2 years time if you can break even i assume that is break even on the price you bought at in 2 years you would have paid $ 16,800 more on your mortgage than you would have in rent so here are the facts a better strategy

there are a few sites out there that can give you some reasoning behind the request legalzoom for instance   to quote the doc in case the link dies employee vs. independent contractor if a worker is an employee the employer is responsible for paying    social security unemployment insurance medicare and possibly other    costs like workers compensation insurance for the employee at the    end of the tax year the employer is responsible for compiling all    necessary payroll reports including w-2 forms if a worker is an independent contractor the employer is not    responsible for any of the above taxes or payments and the only added    paperwork is the issuing of a 1099 to the independent contractor at    the end of the tax year if he or she has made more than $ 600 with the    employer as kent suggested you should speak with an attorney really you need one if setting up an llc there are a lot of companies out there these days that try to classify people as contractors rather than full time employees as it gets them out of paying benefits and dealing with taxes this is being heavily cracked down on and several contractor employees are winning lawsuits to get full time status   if you are truly acting as a contractor then setting up an llc can help with a few items such as taxes and protection on certain business aspects see comments below regarding this it 's easy and relatively cheap cost me about $ 250 with extra legal advice tacked on if you are reporting directly to a manager with the company or really working in any way that is n't consistent with the definition of a contractor then i 'd turn down the offer and ask to be made a ft employee   additional information

the point of short selling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you ca n't sell the underlying asset usually because you do n't actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down shorting allows you to profit from a falling price another non speculative possibility is that you do n't have the underlying asset right now and thus ca n't sell it but will get it at a certain point in the future e.g. because it 's bonds that you 've used to guarantee a loan or grain that 's still growing on your fields

it is barely possible that this is citi 's fault but it sounds more like it is on the costco end    the way that this is supposed to work is that they your card for the necessary amount   that reserves the payment removing the money from your credit line   on delivery they are supposed to capture the preauthorization   that causes the money to transfer to them   until that point they 've reserved your payment but not actually received it   if you cancel then they do n't have to pay processing fees    the capture should allow for a larger sale so as to provide for tips and unanticipated taxes and fees    in this case instead of capturing the preauthorization they seem to have simply generated a new transaction   citi could be doing something wrong and processing the capture incorrectly   or costco could be doing a purchase when they should be doing a capture   from outside we ca n't really say    the thirty days would seem to be how long costco can schedule in advance   so the preauthorization can last that long for them    costco should also have the ability to cancel a preauthorization   however they may not know how to trigger that   with smaller merchants they usually have an interface where they can view and capture or cancel them   costco may have those messages sent automatically from their system    note that a common use for this pattern is with things like gasoline or delivery purchases   if this has been citi costco both times i 'd try ordering a pizza or some other delivery food and see if they do it correctly   if it was citi both times and a different merchant the other time then it 's probably a citi problem rather than a merchant problem

as one of the answers described its going to depend on many factors and the environment at the time but there is no sure way to know which strategy is better if any are at all i would say over several hundred years the strategies would be equally as profitable in a free market the longer dated bonds would be priced lower higher yield because they are higher risk and over a long enough time period that higher risk may end up resulting in that bond being worth less or maybe nothing at all in a free market price discovery would factor all this in and the two strategies would become equal the same is true for the price during inversion events having said that we do nt live in a free market with central bankers monetizing debt in so many countries sometimes investing in short term bonds including us treasuries is a guaranteed way to lose purchasing power as these yields are below inflation and sometimes even negative

i agree with joe taxpayer that a lot of details are missing to really evaluate it as an investment for context i own a few investment properties including a small   10 + unit apartment complex my answer might be more than you really want need it kind of turned into real estate investing 101 but to be fair you 're really asking 3 different questions here your headline asks how effective are condo hotel developments as investments an answer to that is sometimes very these are a way for you the investor to get higher rents per sq ft as an owner and for the hotel to limit its risks and access additional development funding by your description it sounds like this particular company is taking a substantial cut of rents i do n't know this property segment specifically but i can give you my insight for longer term apartment rentals the numbers are the same at heart the other two questions you 're implying are how effective is this condo hotel development and should you buy into it if you have the funds and the financial wherewithal to honestly consider this then i am sure that you do n't need your hand held for the investment pros cons warnings of the last question   but let me give you some of my insight as far as the way to evaluate an investment property and a few other questions you might ask yourself before you make the decision to buy or perhaps to invest somewhere else   the finance side of real estate can be simple or complicated it sounds like you have a good start evaluating it but here 's what i would do start with figuring out how much revenue you will actually see gross potential income 365 days x average rent for the room = minus vacancy you 'll have to figure this out you 'll actually do the math as vacancy rate x equals effective potential income = then find out how much you will actually pocket at the end of the day as operating income take minus operating expenses utilities hoa marketing if you do this yourself minus management expenses 40 of any other fees they may charge if you manage it yourself extra tax help minus debt service mortgage payment include insurances property pmi etc = = net operating income noi now noi minus taxes = = net income net income add back depreciation add back sometimes mortgage interest = = after tax cash flows there are two numbers real estate investors can spout off one is the noi the other is the cap rate   in order to answer how effective is this development you 'll have to run the numbers yourself and decide the noi will be based on any assumptions you choose to make for vacancy rates actual revenue from hotel room bookings etc but it will show you how much you should bring in before taxes each year if you divide the noi by the asking price of your unit and then multiply by 100 you 'll get the cap rate this is a rough estimate of the rate of return you can expect for your unit if you buy in   if you come back and say well i found out it has a cap rate we wo n't really be qualified to help you out well established mega investment properties think shopping centers office buildings etc can be as low as 3 5 cap rates and as high as 10 12 the more risky the property the higher your return should be but if it 's something you like and the chance to make a 6 return feels right then that 's your choice or if you have something like a 15 cap rate that 's not necessarily outstanding given the level of risk uncertain vacancies involved in a hotel   some other questions you should ask yourself include   how much competition is there in the area for short term lodging this could drive vacancies up or down and rents up or down as well how liquid will the property room be as an asset if you can just break even on operating expense then it might still make sense as an investment if you think that it might appreciate in value and you would be able to sell the unit to someone else   how much experience does this property management company have a in general b running hotels and c running these kinds of condo hotel combination projects i would be especially interested in what exactly you 're getting in return for paying them 40 of every booking seasonality this will play into joe taxpayer 's question about vacancy rates your profile says you 're from tx which hints that you probably are n't looking at a condo on ski or anything but if you 're looking at something that 's a spring break esque destination then you might still have a great run of high o during march april may june but be nearly empty during october november december   i hope that helps there is plenty of room to make a more exact model of what your cash flows might look like but that will be based on assumptions and research you 're probably not making at this time

looks more like an idea for a business rather than an actual business especially since it has n't even launched that said it does have its merits what bank actually holds the deposit funds becomes irrelevant and may change from time to time as they forge better partnerships with different banks   think of it like a mutual fund the individual stocks if there are stocks in the fund are less important than the balance of risk vs. income and the leveling of change over the course of time it offers services banks offer without fees at least that is the proposal with the addition of capability as well it does have downsides as well there is an increased level of between you and your money they propose to simplify the banking business model but in fact are only hiding it from you   the same complexity that was there before is still there with the added complexity of their service on top of it   it 's just a matter of how much of that complexity you would have to deal with directly with that in mind i would reiterate that they are not a business yet just a proposed business model   even the sign up process is a red flag for me   i understand they need to gauge interest in order to forge initial relationships with various banks but i do n't see the need for the invitation only sign up method   it just sounds like a way to increase interest who does n't like feeling exclusively invited and is a bit too for my taste but like i said the idea has merit i have my reservations but will reserve full judgement until they are an actual operating business

most of the money gained through pe is done through financial engineering deal structuring there are funds that are operationally focused which do make changes on the portfolio company level from what i have seen most people who are operationally focused do not achieve that much in the way of results picture it as consulting except that the results of your initiatives are actually important     as for turn there are funds that specialize in that golden gate capital comes to mind these are far more exciting investments but can be very frustrating if you want to look at it in terms of the public markets in pe are essentially levered value investments it is likely that you are n't going to change the business much but are actually just buying an out of favor business and waiting on the industry to bounce back     the argument that pe funds just gut companies and sell with the new higher operating profitability is somewhat flawed there is really only so much cost cutting you can do once you have fired staff or corrected a mistake you wo n't likely have more chances to gain from that original problem what people should be criticizing is that funds often cut capex and reinvestment to increase results at the expense of the future profitability of the company

how can someone use the account number to withdraw money without my    consent they can use your account number to game your banks phone support and try to their way into your account banks have gotten very good at this but theoretically with just the address he lives in your name and a bad bank phone rep he could get into your business the account number would just be one more piece of information to lead with i have 1 savings and 3 checking accounts with the same bank would they be able to gain access to the other accounts dependent on how incompetent the bad bank rep i referenced above is sure but the odds are incredibly low and if anything were to happen the bank would be falling over itself to fix it and make so that you do n't sue for a whole crap ton more is there a more secure and still free option that i have overlooked opening up yet another checking account solely for accounts receivable and transfer to accounts payable would keep your financial records more transparent also banks are doing money transfer by email now so i do n't know how great that is for business transactions but in that instance you 're just giving out an email linked to a money receiving account instead of an actual account number paypal is also a pretty good eft middleman but their business practices have become shady in the past 5 years

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

i 'll answer but avoiding discussion of m1 m2 etc too pedantic i do n't believe you are asking about the lifetime of either coins or paper money i think you are referencing the fractional reserve system and how a good portion of the total money supply is created by the banks lending out their deposits in effect creating money my answer to you is that if all loans were simply paid off no mortgages no car loans etc the total money in the system would collapse to some reasonable fraction of what it is today 10 or a bit less this comes from the fact that the reserve requirement for most large banks is 10   i 'm referencing money but not bills or coins think about what you make in a year how much do you touch as paper money for my wife and me it 's no more than a few percent most goes from a direct deposit to online payments so this would be the subject of a different question altogether   let me know if this addresses your question

this falls under value investing and value investing has only recently picked up study by academia say at the turn of the therefore there is n't much rigorous on value investing in academia but it has started however we can describe valuations in short valuations are randomly distributed in a log variance gamma fashion with some reason nonsense mixed in you can check for yourself on   you can basically download the entire us market and then some with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet re fisher he was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index but as for stocks he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau i do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels such as bears have predicted i expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months    irving fisher ph.d. in economics oct. 17 1929 edit value investing has almost always been ignored by academia   irving fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by graham in the mid 20th century certainly did n't help with comments like the above   it was almost always believed that it was a sucker 's game the bigger sucker game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recession collapses   so even though a economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer collapses value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always collapse   this expresses that sentiment perfectly it did n't help that benjamin graham did n't care about money so never reached the heights of buffett who frequently with bill gates as the richest person on the planet   buffett has given much credibility and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least that 's where i begin seeing papers being published into value concepts   if one looks harder academia 's even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools yes investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing but they are not academics the days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until buffett entered the and embarrassed them all with his club 's performance in the article which is still relatively ignored   before that it was the obsession with beta the ratio of a security 's variance to its covariance to the market a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the of beta have embraced the p b not giving the satisfaction to buffet by the p e.    tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a long surviving tiny tech firm usually does n't stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates   this is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations risk adjusted they should pay out huge on average   still most fall by the dead and those 100 p s valuations quickly crumble valuations are influenced by growth   one can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity where p is price i is income r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate of i.   rearranging r looks like here one can see that a higher p relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it it 's fun for us value investor traders to say that the market is totally inefficient   that 's a stretch   it 's not perfectly inefficient but it 's efficient   valuations are clustered very tightly around the median but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two if one were to look at a distribution of rs see that they 're even more tightly packed   so while it looks like p es are all over the place industry to industry rs are much more well clustered tech finance and frequently have higher growth rates so higher p es yet average rs   utilities and non have lower growth rates so lower p es yet average rs

credit scores rates are based on sometimes simple and sometimes quite complex statistical models linear models neural networks regression and classification trees mixture models depends on whether it is something more general like fico or what large banks develop in house in any case there are many legislation dependent factors qualitative such as education occupation security sex etc payment history or quantitative such as age liquidity and leverage ratios etc   now most model that are used today are and closely held trade secrets the most important reason for this is actually because of the databases that feed the models more better quality data is what makes the real difference although at the cutting edge the mathematicians statisticians computer scientists that design the algorithms will make a huge difference   now back to the main thing the credit score rate is meant to be used only as an indicator for representing the probability of default how likely you are to default on your obligation towards me is what it means and that is largely based upon has company he she honoured his financial obligations of a certain consumer in more sophisticated models they may also use your industry sector or occupational and financial security to predict the future behaviour however this credit score has meaning only in relation to a credit limit can you pay back my $ x the credit limit on the other hand is defined by your income level debt asset etc    as a credit risk analyst whether we are dealing with large corporate loans mortgages personal loans etc the principles are the same one thing to consider is that factors considered in determining a credit score usually do not have a simple linear relationship   consumer profile types such as rate are a lot more about effect than cause    the most important thing is to honour your obligations whether you pay before or after you spend makes little difference so long as you pay in full and prior to maturity your rate score will improve with time financial institutions have many ways to make money of everyone some such as interest rates and fees are directly charged to you and some are charged to your goods and services providers that has no bearing on your score sometimes it even makes sense to take on customers with rock bottom ratings lend them lots of money and charge them to dirt as you may well know the recent financial crisis with ongoing after shocks and was the result of such practices

i think you misunderstand the purpose of the liability account   i would suggest you review the standard accounting model but to give you a brief overview income and expenses are money coming into and out of your possession   they are the pipes flowing into and out of your box   inside your box you have assets bank savings cash etc and liabilities credit cards unpaid debts etc   money can flow into and out of either asset or liability accounts for example deposit a payment income to asset buy office supplies with cash asset to expense pay a bill with credit card liability to expense customer pays one of your debts directly income to liability   paying off a debt with an asset does not affect your overall net worth so paying a check to your credit card bill asset to liability does n't decrease your total balance it merely moves the value from one bucket to another now to your question mandatory payments such as taxes or insurance or for that matter utilities rent all things that must be bought occasionally are not liabilities instead they are all expenses   they might be paid from a liability account if they are paid on credit for example but the money still flows from liability to expense   in my own records i have expense taxes and expense insurance with sub accounts in each   where the money comes from depends entirely on how i pay my bills whether from cash or banks asset or whether it 's a charge liability   sometimes you receive payments back from an insurance company   i find that rather than treating insurance premiums as a positive balance in a liability with eventual payments as debits to the liability account it is better to treat any payment from the insurance as income hope that helps

for most people investing in the stock market directly is one of the last things to do   that 's not to say you should n't but rather that there are other things to consider as well start with automatic monthly deposits to a liquid account such as savings or money market the morale boost you get from seeing the balance grow is nearly impossible to beat following that paying down any debts such as student loans or credit cards once you 've done that then you should look at company sponsored 401k plans or iras sharebuilder offers iras holding whichever stock or fund you pick again automatic monthly deposits are the way to go here good luck and happy investing

the uk does n't have a gift tax in limited circumstances if the giver is also in the uk and dies within 7 years then some inheritance tax might be payable but if you 're in india that wo n't apply india also appears not to have any gift tax if the giver is an uncle of the recipient so no tax will be payable by either party here there 's also no tax deduction for gifts in either the uk or india so if this is out of your income you 'll probably already have paid tax on the money in some form

the fund will take a small percentage of its assets to cover the expenses   reported returns come after the expense ratio has been factored into things money market mutual funds can have a zero yield in some cases though breaking the buck can happen in some cases as noted on wikipedia the first money market mutual fund to break the buck was first    for daily income in 1978 liquidating and    nav at 94 cents per share an argument has been made that was not    technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the    average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two    however prospective investors were informed that would invest    solely in short term 30 90 days money market obligations    furthermore the rule which restricts the maturities which money    market funds are permitted to invest in rule of the investment    company act of 1940 was not until 1983 prior to the    adoption of this rule a mutual fund had to do little other than    present itself as a money market fund which did seeking higher    yield had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities and    rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio    in order to meet increasing redemptions the fund was forced to sell a    certificate of deposit at a 3 loss triggering a of its    nav and the first instance of a money market fund breaking the    buck the community bankers us government fund broke the buck in 1994    paying investors 96 cents per share this was only the second failure    in the then history of money funds and there were no further    failures for 14 years the fund had invested a large percentage of its    assets into adjustable rate securities as interest rates increased    these floating rate securities lost value this fund was an    institutional money fund not a retail money fund thus individuals    were not directly affected no further failures occurred until september 2008 a month that saw    events for money funds however as noted above other    failures were only averted by of capital from the fund    sponsors thus consider how likely is fidelity investments prepared to have people question how safe is their money with them which is why fund sponsors rarely break the buck

up to some degree a higher or lower interest rate means a bit less or a bit more money in your pocket if the interest rate gets too high you may be in trouble so you first look at the situation and ask yourself at what interest rate would i be in trouble   if this is a $ 20,000 student loan then even a very high rate would n't be trouble it would be unfortunate and unpleasant but not fatal for a $ 800,000 mortgage that 's different each percent more is $ 8,000 a year going from 3 to 10 would change the interest from $ 24,000 to $ 80,000 a year which would be fatal for many people   in a situation where you can afford increasing variable payments without problems you can go for it if your variable rate would vary over time between 4 and 6 you would still be even in that situation go for variable taking into account where you think interest rates will go in the future for a mortgage the security would likely be more important on the other hand if your dad is a multi millionaire who would help you out then that big rate increase would n't be fatal and you could go for a variable rate mortgage   in some countries you can cancel any loan contract when the interest rate is raised so raising a variable mortgage interest rate would allow you to look elsewhere without early repayment penalties check out if that is the case for you

ideally one would contribute the maximum amount you 're allowed to both the tsp and an ira for the 2015 tax year that would be $ 18,000 for the tsp and $ 5,500 for the ira if you 're 50 or older then you can add an additional catch up amount of $ 6,000 to the tsp and $ 1,000 to the ira if like most people you can not contribute the maximum to both then i would recommend the tsp over an ira until you 've maximized your tsp unquestionably you should contribute at least enough to the tsp to get the maximum agency match beyond that there is a case to be made to contribute to an ira for certain investors benefits of tsp compared to ira benefits of ira compared to tsp so for an investor who wants simplicity i would recommend just doing the tsp unless you can invest more in which case an ira is a smart choice for a knowledgeable and motivated investor it can make sense to also have an ira to gain access to asset classes not in the tsp 's basic index funds

the technical term for it is timing the market and if you can pull it off correctly you will do quite well the problem is that it is almost impossible to consistently do well if it were that easy there would be a lot of billionaires walking around even wall street experts have n't been able to predict the market that well this idea is almost universally considered a bad idea consider this when has the stock dropped low enough that you are buying low and let 's say you do buy low and it doubles in a month when do you get out what if you are wrong and it doubles again or if it drops 10 do you keep waiting this strategy is rife with problems

when purchasing a condo in a university town it is almost guaranteed that the prices will be inflated as a result   this is because you are competing not only with single home primary residence homeowners but also with a multitude of investment buyers and landlords who want to purchase a rental property   universities are popular rental markets due to their stability there will always be students looking for a place to live and as a result the areas attract investors more than other markets this can work in your favor however   if you do n't mind sharing your residence with other students and you do n't mind the part time work that being a landlord requires you can live much cheaper and even make money over the next few years as your roommates pay your bills   owning a primary residence rental property also brings a lot of tax benefits because you can claim expenses and depreciation against your income   this could benefit your father who could be a co owner and would certainly benefit from the write offs against his higher tax bracket the real trick that makes or breaks the experience is finding mature responsible roommates who will cause the minimum amount of headache   if this part of the equation is missing it can lead to distractions from school and even legal worries when you have to think about things like unpaid rent and/or

gt one of the best news i 've heard today that 's the right way awesome gesture   i do n't know on this one while it gives the warm all it means in reality is the seats will be all be sold out really fast    the economist in me that i pretend to be while listening to freakonomics in my car wants to point to this quote that i feel turned me around on this   and consumer surplus is one of the most important things in economics one of the incredible of the market system is that for so much of what we buy we would have been willing to pay way more for it than we actually have to a great example is water how much do we pay for water each month i do n’t know what your water bill is mine is maybe $ 40 but think about how much we ’d be willing to pay for water water is i mean we ’d be willing to pay almost anything for water but it ’s really really cheap so in that way the modern economy has arranged things so that we get things we need like water and food much more cheaply than we ’d be willing to pay and that is really important that is really the magic of the market    gt to me what sounds like the problem is how do you measure that because i need to know what you in your head were willing to pay before you came to the store and then were confronted with the actual price so how typically have economists measured those two numbers what you pay and what you ’re willing to pay   gt so you have never been more right about anything in your life than what you just said because we simply have no good ways to measure consumer surplus because we know what people pay we can sometimes see that observe how much they buy but we never see what ’s inside their head what their choice what they would be willing to pay if we ’re really going to estimate a consumer surplus what you would want to do is you would want to take a consumer and somehow magically you ’d want to reproduce that consumer in 10 parallel universes   source

if you have no credit score it is generally far easier and more affordable to establish credit the cheapest way possible which is usually in the form of a small credit card student card if you are a student low credit line unsecured or even secured if you need your local bank credit union will usually be keen to offer you something to start out but you can also apply online to some of the major credit card vendors as always look out for annual fees etc in general trying to get a larger loan to establish credit will cost you a lot as you will not qualify for any legitimate 0 or ultra low apr car loans those are reserved for people with established and generally pretty good credit i expect you 'll find a car loan that will have a lower apr than you could get investing your money otherwise especially if you do not have established excellent credit to simply be a phantom you wo n't find it and even if you could it is more risky than it is worth furthermore if establishing credit is important to you such as for buying a house down the road you can build an excellent credit score without ever having a car loan so you do n't have to buy a car on borrowed money just to hope to get approved for a house some day it 's just not a requirement finally i urge you to make a decision on the best car for you in your situation ignoring the credit score especially if you are more than 3 5 + years away from buying a house everything else about buying a car is more important the actual cost of the car year mileage suitability for your needs gas mileage maintenance and insurance costs etc   then at the very end of your decision making process ensure that buying the car would not put you dangerously low on savings by squeezing your emergency fund decide if you really need a loan or as expensive of a car considering the costs over the expected life of you owning the car or at least the next 2 5 years never get trapped into just thinking about monthly payments which hide the true cost of loans and buying beyond what you can afford to purchase today

the expense fees are high and unfortunate i would stop short of calling it criminal however   what you are paying for with your expenses is the management of the holdings in the fund the managers of the fund are actively continuously watching the performance of the holdings buying and selling inside the fund in an attempt to beat the stock market indexes whether or not this is worth the expenses is debatable but it is indeed possible for a managed fund to beat an index   despite the relatively high expenses of these funds the 401 k is still likely your best investment vehicle for retirement the money you put in is tax deductible immediately your account grows tax deferred and anything that your employer kicks in is free money   since in the short term you have little choice do n't lose a lot of sleep over it   just pick the best option you have and occasionally suggest to your employer that you would appreciate different options in the future if things do n't change and you have the option in the future to rollover into a cheaper ira feel free to take it

you ca n't really avoid inflation as the population grows the amount of money needed will grow as well because the people will grow up and go to work and earn money and someone has to create it to pay them one of the definitions of inflation is increasing amount of money increasing amount of money causes devaluation for example if instead of 1000 dollars we now have 2000 dollars in circulation because the population tripled in the last 50 years while in russia the population remained the same and they have the same 1000 rubles as they had 50 years ago 1 ruble will no longer cost 1 dollar but rather 2 i.e. prices rise this is very simplified of course and there are a lot of causes and triggers for inflation inflation when controlled and within certain limits is necessary for growth as mentioned but when uncontrolled and very high it causes a lot of damage and that 's what troubles people about inflation not its mere existence as to bringing the prices the prices do n't go down the   gallon of gas will not go back to $ 0.25 it 's just the buying power of the money goes down because of inflation you could buy a gallon of gas for 0.25 50 years ago but you had to work for 1/2 hour to earn these 0.25 now you have to pay $ 4 but if you still need to work for 1/2 hour for that then the price did n't rise effectively

there is no single market interest rate there are myriad interest rates that vary by risk profile term corporate bonds are typically riskier than bank deposits and therefore pay a higher effective rate when the market for that bond is in equilibrium than a bank account does if you are willing to accept a higher risk in order gain a higher return you might choose bonds over bank deposits if you want an even higher return and can accept even higher risk you might turn to stocks over bonds if you want still higher return and can bear the still higher risk derivatives may be more appealing than stocks

futures are an agreement to buy or sell something in the future   the futures price is the price at which you agree to make the trade   this price does not indicate what will happen in the future so much as it indicates the cost of buying the item today and holding it until the future date   hence for very liquid products such as stock index futures the futures price is a very simple function of today 's stock index value and current short term interest rates   if the stock exchange is closed but the futures exchange is open then using the futures price and interest rates one can back out an implied fair value for the index which is in essence the market 's estimate of what the stock index value would be right now if the stock market were open   of course as soon as the stock exchange opens the futures price trades to within a narrow band of the actual index value where the size of the band depends on transaction costs bid ask spread commissions etc

one reason a company might choose to pay a dividend is because of the desire of influential stockholders to receive the dividend    in the case of ford for example there are 70 million shares of class b stock which receive the same dividend per share as do the common stock holders   even though there are 3.8 billion shares of common stock the class b owners which are ford family hold 40 of the voting power and so their desires are given much weight    the class b owners prefer regular dividends because if enough were to sell their class b shares all class b shares as a block would have their voting power drop from 40 to 30 and with further sales all special voting would be lost and each class b share would be equivalent to a common share in voting power hence the class b owners both for themselves and for all of the family members holding class b avoid selling shares and prefer receiving dividends

a friend since july online and big business talks and trust money forwards   usually a question is this a scam or legitimate is hard to answer since obviously scams are modelled after legitimate stories or they 'd easily fail if there were for scam or legitimate this one would easily gather odds of   the only plausible reason for this to be legitimate would be to defraud the scam or legitimate at any rate exxon is a large company and has to obey labor laws   they can not set up operations in a manner where their workers may not have access to their salary for prolonged times without easy remedy drop communications immediately do n't open them do n't read them   they hook you with emotional investment   they will efforts if it appears you are slipping out of their reach   explanations will become more plausible more pressing more emotionally charged   you are a big promising fish and they wo n't let you swim off without a serious struggle to you hand your communication so far to law enforcement   that may help with not having to figure this out on your own

the name of this type of investment is capital guaranteed investment and yes they do exist some financial institutions do offer them from time to time and they can be better than putting money in the bank unlike what someone else said your money is not is not locked for the five years you can take out your investment at any time but if you do take your money out before the term 5 years in your mother 's case the capital is void so you would only withdrawal your money if the investment is currently in because if it is at a loss when you go to withdrawal you get hit with the loss in many cases you will get a third party usually a large bank being guarantor for the capital guarantee and they in turn get paid for this obligation

form is to report to the irs withholding of capital gains tax that may be due from the seller foreign nationals do n't always file tax returns so they often did n't pay capital gains tax on properties that they sold congress decided to make the buyers responsible for this tax so that they would have a better chance of collecting it there is a penalty against the buyer if that tax is not withheld your attorney should have filed this form on your behalf as part of the closing papers i think your first step is to look at your copy of the closing papers and see if money was withheld from the sale there definitely should be disclosure of these requirements before the sale you should also follow up with your attorney to see whether he has already filed the forms and on your behalf if you had purchased for less than $ 300,000 and were purchasing for your primary residence you would not have to file that form but since the property was under $ 1,000,000 the withholding rate is only 10 rather than 15

i think to some extent you may be confusing the terms margin and leverage from investopedia two concepts that are important to traders are margin and leverage margin is a loan extended by your broker that allows you to leverage the funds and securities in your account to enter larger trades in order to use margin you must open and be approved for a margin account the loan is collateralized by the securities and cash in your margin account the borrowed money does n't come free however it has to be paid back with interest if you are a day trader or this may not be a concern but if you are a swing trader you can expect to pay between 5 and 10 interest on the borrowed money or margin going hand in hand with margin is leverage you use margin to create leverage leverage is the increased buying power that is available to margin account holders   essentially leverage allows you to pay less than full price for a trade giving you the ability to enter larger positions than would be possible with your account funds alone leverage is expressed as a ratio a 2:1 leverage for example means that you would be able to hold a position that is twice the value of your trading account if you had $ 25,000 in your trading account with 2:1 leverage you would be able to purchase $ 50,000 worth of stock margin refers to essentially buying with borrowed money   this must be paid back with interest   you also may have a margin call forcing you to liquidate assets if you go beyond your margin limits leverage can be achieved in a number of ways when investing one of which is investing with a margin account

there are a number of ways you could do this the first step is to work out what a fair price is either make an estimate that you both accept possibly getting a real estate agent to give you a free evaluation or get a professional evaluation from some you both accept once you have a valuation the simplest of course is to pay your brother that value in return for his transferring his ownership to you hopefully you have that much money in savings if you do n't have that money but do have income you may need to take a mortgage which would put your home at risk if the pollution you speak of has n't been fixed a mortgage may be out of the question an alternative if you have income and your brother does n't need the money right now is to make the money you owe him for the house a loan from him to you he transfers his ownership of the house to you you pay him its value but he simultaneously loans you that exact same amount no actual money needs to change hands you would make him a regular payment essentially the interest on that loan and also make an agreement to pay off the principal of the loan i.e. the value of the house when the house is sold or when you pass away while you could do this informally if everyone agrees it would be much better to make a legal agreement so that everybody is exactly sure what they are expecting

there 's already an excellent answer here from but i wanted to expand a bit on types of investments with some additional actionable information you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply    collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and    many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer    is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for    retirement you should be investing in the stock market however    picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in    a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the    stock market so how does one go about actually investing in the stock market in a diversified way what if you also want to diversify a bit into bonds fortunately in the last several years several products have come about that do just these things and are targeted towards newer investors these are often labeled robo advisors most even allow you to adjust your allocation according to your risk preferences here 's a list of the ones i know about while these products all to achieve similar goals of giving you an easy way to obtain a diversified portfolio according to your risk they differ in the buckets of stocks and funds they put your money into the careful investor would be wise to compare which specific etfs they use e.g. looking at their expense ratios capitalization and spreads

let me paint you a picture to show you why this does not make sense     it is never fair to ask a business to pay a living wage it is always fair to ask a worker to chose their jobs based on their needs   here 's why   i ran a business when i was a teenager doing web development i did not make very good money but it pushed me to learn and to teach myself to meet the needs of the few clients that i did manage to find   over the course of the business the thought had crossed my mind to maybe get help from my peers maybe talk to classmates and see if any of them might have wanted to go into business with me help me drum up more work or help me do design or development     as soon as the thought crossed my mind i realized right away that i would never be able to do it because the regulation was just way too big for little old sole proprietorship me to deal with   not only was it confusing but it was dangerous to me if i did it wrong i knew i   could be sued and lose more than my tiny little business made     on top of the regs involved i personally was not making minimum wage   what i was making though was experience   this was more valuable than all the money i made combined because i worked this way by myself for three years learning more about my craft all the while   i have that experience into a ten year long career that currently supports my family working for someone else   now imagine if i could pay anyone whatever we both agreed on   imagine if i could talk to a in highschool and say hey i m not making much but i can pay you x to start with and i will certainly teach you what i know   it always struck me as selfish unearned moral superiority to sit here and mandate a minimum wage you price teenagers and entry level workers out of the market because people ca n't afford an army of $ 20 per hour workers   its so ignorant of the narrow margins that these business have to face   it is also really short sighted and money obsessed to boil a job down to it 's wages alone   minimum wage destroys an ancient method of generating skilled workers the apprentice system   also there is a really ugly moral side to this   person a offers person b x amount to do y why does the government have the right to say no you ca n't pay them x because it is not x enough   our economy and work is far more complex than minimum wage it is an old idea that is nothing but a drain on our economy   tl;dr i would have added three or more skilled workers to our economy in high school if i did not have to pay them minimum wage   i personally was priced out of hiring people because of it so i hate it     millennials need not wonder why no one can find a job

you should ask a cpa or tax lawyer to what extent living in specific housing provided by the employer as a job requirement is exempt from taxation   you might find a nice surprise   your tax professional can also help you to report the items properly if mis reported much of this is in the article you cite in the question but perhaps a look at some of the original sources is warranted and will show why some expert advice might be useful   i would argue that an ra who is required to police and counsel undergrads in a college dorm in exchange for a room or a flat is closer to a worker with quarters on a ship or at an oil well than a full professor who receives a rental home in a neighborhood near the university as a benefit   in the first case living at the provided premises is necessary to do the job but in the second case it is merely a benefit of the job    the irs publication guidance on employer provided housing   is not entirely clear so you might want to get some additional advice lodging on your business premises you can exclude the value of lodging    you furnish to an employee from the employee 's wages if it meets the    following tests it is furnished on your business premises it is furnished for your convenience the employee must accept it as a condition of employment different tests may apply to lodging furnished by educational    institutions see section of the internal revenue code for    details if you allow your employee to choose to receive additional pay instead    of lodging then the lodging if chosen is n’t excluded the exclusion    also does n't apply to cash allowances for lodging on your business premises    for this exclusion your business    premises is generally your employee 's place of work for example if    you 're a household employer then lodging furnished in your home to a    household employee would be considered lodging furnished on your    business premises for special rules that apply to lodging furnished    in a camp located in a foreign country see section of the    internal revenue code and its regulations   for your convenience    whether or not you furnish lodging for your convenience as an employer    depends on all the facts and circumstances you furnish the lodging to    your employee for your convenience if you do this for a substantial    business reason other than to provide the employee with additional    pay this is true even if a law or an employment contract provides    that the lodging is furnished as pay however a written statement    that the lodging is furnished for your convenience is n't sufficient condition of employment    lodging meets this test if you require your    employees to accept the lodging because they need to live on your    business premises to be able to properly perform their duties    examples include employees who must be available at all times and    employees who could n't perform their required duties without being    furnished the lodging    it does n't matter whether you must furnish    the lodging as pay under the terms of an employment contract or a law    fixing the terms of employment example of qualifying lodging you employ sam at a construction project at a remote job site in    alaska due to the of facilities for the employees who    are working at the job site to obtain lodging and the prevailing    weather conditions you furnish lodging to your employees at the    construction site in order to carry on the construction project you    require that your employees accept the lodging as a condition of their    employment you may exclude the lodging that you provide from sam 's    wages additionally since sufficient eating facilities are n’t    available near your place of employment you may also exclude meals    you provide to sam from his wages as discussed under meals on your    business premises later in this section example of lodging a hospital gives an employee of the hospital the choice of    living at the hospital free of charge or living elsewhere and    receiving a cash allowance in addition to her regular salary if    chooses to live at the hospital the hospital ca n't exclude the value    of the lodging from her wages because she is n't required to live at    the hospital to properly perform the duties of her employment one question would be how the conflict with irc is resolved for someone who must live in the dorm to watch over the dorm and its undergrads here 's from d lodging furnished by certain educational institutions to employees 1 in general   in the case of an employee of an educational    institution gross income shall not include the value of qualified    campus lodging furnished to such employee during the taxable year 2    exception in cases of inadequate rent paragraph 1 shall not apply to    the extent of the excess a the lesser i 5 percent of the    appraised value of the qualified campus lodging or ii the average    of the rentals paid

the issue is how likely you will have zero income for six months and what are your monthly expenses if you know the maximum medical bill you face that may allow you to save a smaller amount but you still have to protect for that loss of income the could be because of job loss medical emergency or other family crisis   if i told you that   the chances you would face a crisis dropped by 50 would you decide that the need for an emergency fund went away or would you still create a fund i think the need still exists just to avoid the downside if you are n't prepared

there are usually so many different options around for the same stock that some are rarely traded especially if the price has moved since the option was issued nobody might be interested in that particular option at that price anymore so the asking price might be something that someone asked for ages ago and that is much higher than anyone would reasonably pay today   with a bid of $ 20 and an ask of $ 30 nobody is trading but the value of that option is somewhere between $ 20 and $ 30 if the value is below $ 25 someone will notice your $ 25 bid and sell

in general a stock can open at absolutely any price with no regard for the closing price or after hours price the previous day the opening price will be determined by the best bid and offer made by people who decide to trade the next day   some of the those people may have put orders in on a prior day that are still on the books and matter but there 's a lot of time overnight for people to cancel orders and enter new ones which is especially likely to happen if there was substantive news overnight as for what you can do in your case you have the same options that you always had   sell or hold   if you 're selling you can sell after hours in the pre open hours or during the trading day   there 's nothing we can say about this case that 's really any different than we can say about any other stock on any other day

the price of real estate reacts to both demand for property and the rate of inflation and rate of income growth mortgage rates generally move as treasury rates move see this paragraph as we mentioned intermediate term bonds and long term mortgages more properly mortgage backed securities or mbs compete for the same fixed income investor dollar treasury issues are 100 guaranteed to be repaid but mortgages are not therefore mortgages carry more risk of default or early repayment which could potentially the return on the investment therefore mortgage rates must be priced higher to compensate for that risk but how much higher are mortgages priced in a normal market the average spread or markup above the 100 secured treasury is about 170 basis points or 1.7 that markup the spread relationship widens and contracts with a range of market conditions investor appetites and supply of available product as well as the presence of competing investment opportunities like corporate bonds or domestic or foreign equity markets source what moves mortgage rates and when the stock market crashes investors tend to run to bonds and treasuries which causes prices to go up and treasury yields to drop theoretically this would also cause mortgage rates to drop although most mortgage rates have a base price below which they can not fall how easy is it to profit from recent stock market drops and at what frequency incredibly difficult the issue with your strategy is that you can not predict the bottom of the market at least us mortals ca n't just take the month of august for example stocks fell something like 15 after the first 5 10 drop people felt that the bottom was there so they rushed in only to have the market fall even more   how will you know when to invest even if the market falls by 50 and there 's a huge buying opportunity and you increase the mortgage on your house odds are your rates will increase because of the equity you take out what if the market stays low for a very long time will you be able to maintain mortgage payments japan 's stock bubble popped in the early 90 's and they 've had two lost decade 's now furthermore there are issues of liquidity what if you need more capital can you just sell a property or can you buy now property to draw equity against what if the market is moving too fast for you to take advantage of do n't ignore transaction costs and taxes either   overall there are a lot of ways that your idea can go wrong and not many ways it can go right

each way you go is a little bit of a gamble    owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth    the royalty is best in situations where you 're getting a portion of the gross since you get paid as a creditor no matter how the company is performing or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth then they 're pretty much both for the same thing you 've removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment if the company ever does buy out or go public how much of your additional x earning a month would you have to then re invest to get an equity stake   and for royalties if another developer came aboard or your company bought another company how much would this dilute your ip contribution so aside from the gambling nature of the issue i 'm not sure your tax calculation is right   you can take equity profit as dividend as long as you 're collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend   this would put those profits into a different tax bracket 15 capital gains or if all profits are split you could take part as salary part as dividend   as well as someone who 's making active income off of their ip not passive income you 're supposed to file a schedule c not a schedule e so your royalties would include your self employment taxes   the schedule e is for royalties where the author is n't actively in the field or actually self employed in that area or if you own royalties on something you did n't create   should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a schedule e.   now a tax advantage may exist on a schedule c if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you ca n't on a schedule e though it 'd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a schedule e.

i think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person it is not the price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at if apple last traded at $ 100/share then apple shares are worth $ 100 if good news about apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money and the most recent trade becomes $ 105 then that is now what apple shares are worth remember that generally speaking the company itself does not sell you its shares instead some other investor sells you shares they already own when a company sells you shares it is called a public offering to get to your actual question saying something is priced in implies that the market that is investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something for example if you open up your newspaper and read an article about ibm inventing a new type of computer chip you might want to invest in ibm but the rest of the market has also heard the news so everyone else has already traded ibm assuming that this new chip would be made that means when you buy even if sales later go up because of the new chip those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at one principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency generally if there were perfect market efficiency then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price in such a scenario the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort it would mean that everyone 's collective best guess about what will happen to the company has been priced in to the most recent share trade

it 's not your problem but it is mine every expense garnered from using insurance makes the cost go up and as the article stated that employer had 1/4 mil hit to his insurance due to drugs etc that is sure to increase his insurance rates thus he needs to be more mindful of whom he hires thus anyone who wants to get hired by a large experienced company needs to keep this in mind people do n't like to think how their freedoms can negatively impact other people never could it be argued that freedom has a negative impact

when i was pursuing my business degree in canada we were told the standard notice period is 2 weeks on both sides this means your employer is required to give you at least two weeks notice and you are required to give it as well if you violate your notice requirement the employer can sue you for lost revenues and etc for that time period the converse side is if your employer failed to provide you with sufficient notice you could sue for lost wages for that time frame as well i 'm sure you can contractually agree to more than the legal minimum of two weeks

so obviously realtors are not economists and have a strong bias here   a lot of actual features the tax deductions economists think the mortgage deduction is nonsense and does n't actually promote home ownership countries without the deduction have about the same ownership rates as the u.s.   worth noting that this proposal does n't actually scrap the mortgage deduction it just makes the standard deduction bigger some people will end up better off with the new standard deduction and those with more expensive homes can keep using the mortgage deduction   this is one of the few proposals coming out of the republican congress that actually helps poor people more than rich people

you need to use one of each so a single order would n't cover this   the stop loss order could be placed to handle triggering a sell market order if the stock trades at $ 95 or lower   if you want you could use a stop limit order if you have an exit price in mind should the stock price drop to $ 95 though that requires setting a price for the stop to execute and then another price for the sell order to execute the limit sell order could be placed to handle triggering a sell if the stock rises above $ 105 on the bright side once either is done the other could be canceled as it is n't applicable anymore

gt;most tax incentives are not a literal real time transfer of money from the tax payers to the corporations   but they are in fact exactly that they are just not direct transfers   gt;i have had quite a few discussions with people about this and some folks think that their tax dollars are literally being transferred form their paycheck withholdings to a company 's bank account and that is not exactly true   no it is not technically true but in the end it is ultimately more true than you are attempting to characterize it   if someone poison onto ground grows plants that they know will take up that feeds the resulting grain to a chicken and then serves the chicken to his guests he is not directly poisoning his guests but in fact he still is poisoning them     go reread or on the seen versus the unseen

let 's look at some of your options in a savings account your $ 40,000 might be earning maybe 0.5 if you are lucky   in a year you 'll have earned $ 200   on the plus side you 'll have your $ 40,000 easily accessible to you to pay for moving closing costs on your new house etc if you apply it to your mortgage you are effectively saving the interest on the amount for the life of the loan   let 's say that the interest rate on your mortgage is 4   if you were staying in the house long term this interest would be compounded but since you are only going to be there for 1 year this move will save you $ 1600 in interest this year which means that when you sell the house and pay off this mortgage you 'll have $ 1600 extra in your pocket you said that you do n't like to dabble in stocks   i would n't recommend investing in individual stocks anyway   a stock mutual fund however is a great option for investing but only as a long term investment   you should be able to beat your 4 mortgage but only over the long term   if you want to have the $ 40,000 available to you in a year do n't invest in a mutual fund now i would lean toward option 2 applying the money to the mortgage   however there are some other considerations do you have any other debts maybe a car loan student loan or a credit card balance   if so i would forget everything else and put everything toward one or more of these loans first do you have an emergency fund in place or is this $ 40,000 all of the cash that you have available to you   one rule of thumb is that you have 3 to 6 months of expenses set aside in a safe easily accessible account ready to go if something comes up    are you saving for retirement   if you do n't already have retirement savings in place and are adding to it regularly some of this cash would be a great start to a roth ira or something like that invested in a stock mutual fund if you are already debt free except for this mortgage you might want to do some of each keep $ 10,000 in a savings account for an emergency fund if you do n't already have an emergency fund put $ 5,000 in a roth ira if you are n't already contributing a satisfactory amount to a retirement account and apply the rest toward your mortgage

well first of all they clawed back 75 of those bonuses paid out so they really did n't get paid that money   second not every executive not even probably more than one executive was even aware this was happening there is one who might have known it was happening but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team the executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically   third those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options stock options glean their value from the price of the stock if the stock price goes down then their bonuses lose value or become worthless essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down so if the scandal had no affect on the stock price why would n't they get paid their bonuses the stock is the best indicator of the public 's reaction to the entirety of the bank

the key question is this what brings you happiness how much is this behavior actually making you miserable   it 's possible and important to find balance between frugality and as you say being a miser it 's also important to understand the diminishing return and to value not just your hour of time but your happiness hour by this i mean there 's a distinction between an hour arguing with a customer service rep and spending an hour on a project yourself there are countless people who push a lawn mower around every saturday even though they have the money to hire a mowing company fresh air exercise quiet time for them it makes sense we pick and choose   the happy mower is in a good place the miserable mower who hates doing it and just wo n't spend the money not so much   frugal simply means not wasteful but it can be misunderstood to mean cheap when our brand of tp is on sale i 'll use coupons and stock up unless you visited and into a cabinet all seems normal a visit to a friend 's summer home taught us the value of packing a few rolls for a weekend visit into the unknown her cheap brand was like and every item in her house was a strange brand i 'd never heard of including food items well beyond expiration she took cheap to a new level   in the end this question is less about finance than about psychology

for the requirement for risk free and hassle free account a cd or money market account through your local bank credit union or even large online bank will be fine these funds wo n't grow very fast over time but they are safe and insured these types of accounts are perfect for all the miscellaneous birthday holiday and religious event checks there is not a requirement that the money be in a ugma uniform gifts to minors act account putting it in a ugma account does make it hard for the parents to spend the irs does allow the child to have earnings from banks without the formality of a ugma the money should n't be moved between the parent 's and child 's account but it is possible for the parents to spend the child 's money if times are tight and the money is used for items that benefit the child if there is a reasonable assumption of college then the 529 plan makes a lot of sense the prepaid tuition options would be risky because they tend to be tied to a single state and who knows where they will be living in 10 to 15 years the 529 does focus the money to be used for educational expenses but it can be used for non educational expenses if you are willing to pay the taxes and penalties it can also be transferred to another child later or even other family members in my state the 529 plan does n't have to be used right after high school graduation it can be used up to 30 years after graduation so they can decide a few years later that they want to go back to school

for me i factor in a couple of things first of all there are occasional opportunities for me to get more money at work that happen infrequently if i 'm in one of those periods i pretty much value my time at my salary as far as doing something that i 'm not great at or enjoy i also am more likely to buy food to fill me up park in a parking garage instead of walking 15 minutes to park for free etc   but when i do n't have extra incentives i tend to think more of my budget and think about things from there i might spend 4 hours to fix my microwave when it might come down to only saving $ 50-$100 even though my time from work would seem more valuable

using your figures a couple making $ each earn enough to be in the 1 so that is even less than i had originally stated   i could n't find any hard data about personal incomes in the usa since everything seems to be intertwined with household earnings but i did for canada there household income was around the same $ 350 k mark to be in the top 1 and around the same $ to be in the top 1 for personal incomes   given that i think we can assume the wealth distribution is fairly close between countries therefore i stand by my statement that a income will put in you the top 1 of earners though you would need an equally successful partner to be in the top 1 of households

even if you 're paying a lot of taxes now you 're talking marginal dollars when you look at current contribution and average tax rate when making withdrawals   ie if you currently pay 28 on your last dollar and assuming your contribution is entirely in your marginal rate then you 're paying 28 on all of the roth contributions but probably paying a lower average tax rate due to the lower tax rates on the first many dollars    look at the overall average tax rate of your expected retirement income if you 're expecting to pull out $ 100k a year you 're probably paying less than 20 in average taxes because the first third or so is taxed at a very low rate 0 or 15 assuming things do n't change in our tax code   comparing that to your 28 and you have a net gain of 8 by paying the taxes later nothing to shake a stick at at minimum have enough in your traditional ira to max out the zero tax bucket at least $ 12k   realistically you probably should have enough to max out the 15 bucket as you presumably are well above that bucket now   any roth savings will be more than eliminated by this difference 28 tax now 15 tax later   yes please a diversified combination is usually best for those expecting to have a lot of retirement savings enough in traditional to get at least $ 35k or so a year out say and then enough in roth to keep your comfortable lifestyle after that the one caveat here is in the case when you max out your contribution levels you may gain by using money that is not in your ira to pay the taxes on the conversion   talk to your tax professional or accountant to verify this will be helpful in your particular instance
