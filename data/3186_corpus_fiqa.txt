welcome to the 21st century the new order forget all that legal jumbo you may have read back in law school in the 1960s about commercial code its all gone now now we have check 21 and the patriot act basically what this means is that because some arab fanatics burned down the world trade center the us government and its allied civilian banking company now have total control and dictatorship over your money which is no longer really money but more like a credit to your account with them which they can do with what they want here are some of the many consequences of the two aforementioned acts 1 you can no longer sue a bank for mishandling your money 2 all your banking transaction information is the joint property of the bank its affiliates and the us treasury 3 you can no longer conduct private monetary transactions with other people using a bank as your agent you can only request that a bank execute an unsecured transaction on your behalf and the bank has total control over that transaction and the terms on which occurs you have no say over these terms and you can not sue a bank over any financial tort on you for any reason 4 all banks are required to spy on you report any suspicious actions on your part develop and run special software to detect these suspicious actions and send their employees to government run educational courses where they are taught to spy on customers how to report suspicious customers and how to seize money and safe deposit boxes from customers when the government orders them to do so 5 all banks are required to positively identify everyone who has a bank account or safe deposit box and report all their accounts to the government 6 no transactions can be done anonymously all parties to every banking transaction must be identified and recorded so from the above it should be clear to if you are a lawyer why no endorsement is present that is because your check is not a negotiable instrument anymore it is merely a request to the bank to transfer funds to the treasury the treasury does not need to endorse anything in fact legally speaking the treasury could simply order your bank to empty your account into theirs and they actually do this all the time to people they are investigating for supposed crimes you do n't need to endorse checks you receive either because as i said above the check is no longer a negotiable instrument banks still have people do it but it is just a pro forma habit from the old days since you ca n't sue the bank the endorsement is pretty meaningless because it can not be challenged in court anyway you could probably just write x there and they would deposit it

is there no united states treasury endorsement why should there be and what do you think it would look like some person at treasury sitting at a desk all day signing uncle sam at most you would expect to see some stamp because it 's clear that no person is going to sign all of these checks i have the check returned for proper endorsement no this is none of your business unless you have some serious reason to believe that someone other than the treasury cashed your check if that were really your concern then you 'd have a bigger issue than the endorsement i am required to endorse checks made out to me why is n't the us treasury as others have noted an endorsement is often not required as long as the name on the check matches a name on the account to which it is deposited   individual banks may have stricter rules but that 's between you and your bank

you should also know that its far cheaper for everybody including you at least $ 250,000 over each person 's lifetime each american compared to a canadian to get rid of the whole insurance system and pay for health care with taxes we would n't need any more than today and simply give people health care eliminating all of the administrative complexity from the users standpoint    that would allow doctors and hospitals to save a lot of money on staffing so your tiered system that denies health care to those who ca n't afford to pay actually costs everyone more and they get less care and lower quality care in short we 're cutting off our own nose to spite our face all this time the rest of the world is growing farther and farther ahead of us

answers to your questions 1 do bank account numbers have a checksum no 2 is it plausible that they found out your number after sending you the money by accident no there is no way to find out who possesses a particular bank account just by the number also how they even know they made a mistake they targeted you and knew who you were and your bank account number before the money was sent 3 and 4 is this a scam yes they never paid you any money they forged a check for a large amount and deposited it in an account then divided it up wiring pieces to multiple people all of whom they investigated beforehand since it is a bank to bank transfer it clears once the forgery is discovered all the transfers will be unwound if you had sent them money you would have lost that money other things to note there is zero chance of a wire transfer going to the wrong person because the sender has to list the name and address on the account as well as the number you basically did the right thing which is to notify your bank that you received an unauthorized transfer into your account never accept money into your account from someone you do n't know if money appears in your account tell the bank it is an error and probably proceeds from a forgery and they will take care of it

stop order is shorter term for stop loss order   the point being that is intended as a protective measure   a buy stop order would be used to limit losses when an investor has sold a stock short   meaning that they have borrowed stock and sold it in hopes that they can take advantage of a decline in the stock 's price by replacing the borrowed stock later at a cheaper price   the idea is to limit losses due to a rising stock price   meanwhile a sell stop order would be used to limit losses on a stock that an investor actually owns by selling it before the price declines further the important thing to keep in mind about stop orders is that they turn into market orders when the stop price is reached   this means that they will be filled at the best available price when the order is actually executed   in fast moving markets this can be a price that is quite different from the stop price a limit order allows an investor to ensure that they do not buy sell a stock at more less than the specified amount the thing to keep in mind is that a limit order is not guaranteed to execute a stop limit order is a combination of a stop loss order and limit order in that it becomes a limit order instead of a market order when the stop price is reached links to definitions stop order stop limit order limit order market order

anyone who wants to can use any method they want ultimately the price of the stock will settle on the valuation that people tend to agree on if you think the priced in numbers are too low buy the stock as that would mean that its price will go up as the future earnings materialize if you think it 's too high short the stock as its price will go down as future earnings fail to materialize the current price represents the price at which just as much pressure pushes the price up as down that means people agree it 's reasonably the expected future value imagine if i needed money now and sold at auction whatever salary i make in 2019 how much will i make in 2019 i might be disabled i might be a high earner who knows but if i auction off those earnings whatever price it sells for represents everyone 's best estimate of that value but each participant in the auction can estimate that value however they want if you want to know what something is worth you see what you can sell it for

my question is how is this new value determined   does it go off of    the tax appraised value the tax assessors values are based on broad averages and are not very useful in determining actual home value the most defensible valuation outside of a sale is a professional appraisal real estate agents may or may not give you reasonable estimates but their opinions are less valuable than that of a professional appraiser additionally agents hoping to land you as a client even if you tell them you 're not trying to sell could be motivated to over estimate in many instances a few opinions from agents will be good enough but if there is any contention a professional appraisal will be better should you prior to your death get an independent appraiser to    appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the    properties value with the will or something the real estate market fluctuates too much to make having an appraisal done prior to your death a practical approach in most circumstances you could make arrangements so that an appraisal would be scheduled after your death here 's a good resource on the topic estimating the value of inherited real estate

i agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan it may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money   i know of one called lending club disclaimer i 'm an investor on this platform not trying to advertise it 's just the only place i know of off the top of my head that facilitates loans like this but instead of a bank financing the loan the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount such as $ 25 they have rates anywhere between 5 30 based on your credit and i believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that you 're discussing   regarding buying the house the best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20 downpayment if at all possible below this amount you may be asked to pay for pmi private mortgage insurance this is a charge that does n't go away for quite a while until you 've paid them 20 of the appraised value of the home where you pay a premium because you did n't have the 20 downpayment for the house   i would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible and would recommend the same for your father getting your utilization down and the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable fixed payment   whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you if it were me personally i 'd do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time but if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your tax free savings account it may not be a beneficial situation   treat debt especially credit card debt like an emergency at all times and you 'll find yourself in a better place as a result   credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary and their rates and fees are structured that way if for any reason you expect that a credit card 's balance will remain for an extended period of time you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan instead

since i ca n't vote up the answer yet i will agree with it here i find the best tactic when you call is to tell them you have an offer in hand and will use it if they do n't match the rate exactly or discount it enough to save you the trouble of going through the process of a balance transfer so if they balk and say no then walk and go to the in hand offer just remember the worst they can say is no   if you do n't even bother to ask it 's as if you did and they said no as either scenario leaves you with the same result an unchanged interest rate

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

it 's definitely a racket but safety is a pretty good reason to implement regulation and filters on who can be a driver some places have had illegal taxis operating for years which might be fine a lot of the time but can also lead to drivers robbing hurting people this is the thing that taxi drivers keep trying to remind us of while they try to keep their jobs it 's also why a lot of people would be scared to try in fact my previous manager went on a work trip to africa years ago was met at the airport by a taxi driver got driven into the middle of nowhere and robbed at gunpoint similar might have happened to me and my mum after landing in kuala lumpur years ago having a taxi driver offer us his services which we accepted only for him to run away before we got to his car because the airport police saw him and gave chase on sight   do n't forget when you get into a car you are at the mercy of the driver if taxis were just any dude who happens to be in a car then it could easily be a bad guy pretending to be a taxi driver to find victims but if taxis are uniquely marked and drivers have special licenses you at least get some assurance that their main motivation is to provide a taxi service   a key thing that uber changed is making it feel like the drivers and passengers are easily identified by being on the app while making a strong public case for their service making drivers and passengers seem legitimate but imagine getting into strangers cars a few years ago when it was n't common or even easier imagine getting into a strangers car that you did n't book through uber imagine standing at a bus stop and having some dude in a camry pull up and ask if you need a ride or seeing some guy on craigslist advertising himself as a private taxi who does n't want to use uber   if you 're asking why taxis are so expensive everywhere well that 's probably more to do with them being scummy protectionist businesses than anything else but until a few years ago the service that uber and airbnb provide was highly sketchy outside the proper channels

let ’s try the more straightforward approach again   the current state of economics does n’t take into consideration the human condition   as you have done yourself it refuses to even admit that the human condition should be a factor it considers   but when humans are in dire we find their economic position is directly against their human condition   which of these two will win   hint not the current economic system unless it starts accounting for and being tolerant of the human condition   how could i possibly know that   humans created the economic system   it is not an innate part of their condition contrary to what many would suggest   when faced with two opposing forces humans will almost always destroy the weaker of the two to end the conflict   humans can not destroy the human condition   feelings do have an impact on the economy   trust and loyalty love and hate all impact it   when we let the economy lead to suffering we design its own downfall   if the economic system could instead be seen as only a trade structure that backs off when other influences come to bear it could survive   but the current capitalist structure tries to place money above all else   so of course it is seeing problems

wtf yourself   results matter   billions of dollars are changing hands women are trying to be a part of that and the result is that women are getting a share that is according to most statistical analysis insignificant   you are getting all defensive as if this could only have happened if some nefarious persons at the top decided it must be so but the reality is that persons at the top do not dictate results as you   results are more what we end up with as the result of processes more complex than any of us fully understand and reality most women get excluded early on because of various issues like the intense harassment that they experience at almost every level   you say nothing stops women but analysis of available data appears to show that something is stopping women and that oddly enough we also find inappropriate behavior is endemic to all involved institutions   a lot of people get harassed   you better believe it   i am a gay man and you would not believe some of the shit that i get in   supposedly open minded tech industries   the big difference there is that most straight women have a lot of options open to them while as a gay man i can pretty much thrive and make a lot of money or starve to death in a world that is still with irrational spite that is n't even typically acknowledged   we can all do better   i am sure of that

you are on the right track with your math but be wary of your assumptions if you can borrow money at x% and can afford to make payments on the debt and you can get a return of > x% from investing then you would make more money by keeping the debt and investing your savings another way to think of it by paying off the debt you are getting a guaranteed 5 return because that 's the rate you 'd have paid if you kept the debt be wary of your assumption of getting a 10 return in the s&p 500 nothing is guaranteed even over the long term actual results may well be less and you could lose money it does n't have to be all or nothing why not pay off the higher rate debt at 5 and keep the 3 debt that 's a guaranteed 5 return by paying off the loan and 3 is a pretty low interest rate if you can afford to make the payments i see nothing wrong with investing your savings instead of paying off the loan make sure you have an emergency fund too

hi amy   thank you for your article   got to say however that i tend to disagree   i 've been through the venture rabbit hole a number of times   each one was an experience i 'll never forget and would n't trade for anything   i learned so much more about how the business world actually works or doesn't than i would have at some more established company     that said i am also quite sour on the whole vc thing and at my most recent startup we 've foregone outside investors and bootstrapped things from the get go   it was probably the best decision we made because it allowed us to be flexible in our strategy and not always beholden to the quick exit that vc money always drives      however i realize that not all businesses can be like ours   we started off as a consulting company and moved into build products as our cash reserve grew   if we had wanted to do something big or fast or perhaps manufacture something we would never have had the capital to get it going   those types of business need outside funding and generally it 's only vcs who are willing to take the 1 in 20 bet that startups usually entail   for that i 'm glad that vcs are there and think they provide a very valuable service and part of our economy   i just do n't ever want to have to deal with them again

i agree this article does n't even consider the fact that we may be adding different types of jobs and ones in different industries than those that were lost during the recession    instead it seems to assume that all jobs are uniform and that when the economy adds jobs after a recession that they are replacing the old jobs that we lost that is simply not so nothing is that simple   there are n't just jobs and ceo jobs the economy is more complex than that   we lost a lot of high paying jobs in the recession that just wo n't ever come back especially jobs at financial institutions that were dependent on mortgage backed securities a part of that industry that has since shrunk permanently losing those jobs were necessary and good for the economy the fact that the jobs we are adding now happen to be at a lower wage are basically happenstance as i see it   i 'm just happy that we 're adding jobs the inequality thing will always be an issue and i hope it gets better but this article is pretty elementary when it comes to economic truth

my instinct says that there should be no difference your instincts are right your understanding of math is not so much you sold $ 100 k at the current price of but ended up buying at you earned that 's 100 in usd 50 in rub you bought for the current price of $ 100 k but sold later for $ 200k. you earned $ 100 k 100 in usd which at that time was equal you earned that 's 50 in rub so as your instincts were saying no difference the reason percentages are different is because you 're coming from different angles for the first case your currency is rub for the second case your currency is usd and in both cases you earned 100 if you use the same currency for your calculations percentages change but the bottom line is the same

ironically anyone can say anything but it does n't make it true in normal times the irs can audit you for 3 years or up to 6 for certain cases of fraud from the irs site   how far back can the irs go to audit my return generally the irs can    include returns filed within the last three years in an audit if we    identify a substantial error we may add additional years we usually    do n’t go back more than the last six years hsa spending is reported each year just like any schedule a deductions each year i have my charitable receipts and they are not sent in they are there in case of audit i do n't need to save them forever nor does one need their medical bills forever 3 years 6 if you wish to be paranoid the should be enough   the hsa is unique in that you deposit pretax dollars like a traditional ira or 401(k yet withdrawals for qualified expenses come out tax free like a roth   in my opinion as long as your medical plan qualifies you for an hsa i 'd maximize its use the older you get the more bills you 'll have and at some point you 'll be grateful to your younger self that you did this

overvalued does not mean an opportunity to short   as long as a company 's earnings are decent and there are limited other opportunities in the market a stock would stay overvalued its just that future returns on the stock might be limited for shorting you need an expected trigger say you expect an overvalued company 's earnings to decline or significantly miss expectations this would be a candidate for shorting

the fed does charge interest like you said they do give profits to the treasury each year but not all of their profits are sent back they also pay dividends to the banks that hold stock in the fed i think it is like 7   but   yeah since the fed does pay the rest back to the treasury any interest it pays is basically moot   gt;if you do n't already know this is the modern version of printing money   this is the larger concern if they are just buying bonds to implement monetary policy that is one thing however if they are financing the government debt because foreign investors are strapped for cash or do n't want it that is a bigger problem i have n't been following closely enough to know if that is an issue here but it seems treasury bills are in high demand at the moment so i do n't think the fed is actually financing our budget just keeping rates low which does create problems but that 's a different conversation

assuming you can understand and emotionally handle the volatility a good indeed fund would be wise these are low fee funds which perform as well as our better than most managed investments and since they do n't cost as much they typically out perform most other investment vehicles the s&p 500 is traded as spdr another option is the dow jones industrial average which trades as dia average returns over the long term are 10 12 if you expect to need the money in the short term 5 8 years you have a non trivial chance of needing to pull the money out when the market is down so if that 's unacceptable to you choose something with a guarantee if you 're terrified of losing money in the short term do n't think you can handle waiting for the market to go up especially when every news is crying that the end of economic life on earth is here then consider a cd at your bank cds return much lower rates around 2 right now but do not go down in value ever however you need to lock your money into them for months to years at a time some people might tell you to buy a bond fund that 's horrible advice bond funds get lower returns and have no guarantee that you wo n't lose money on them unlike bonds as you 're new to investing i encourage you to read the intelligent investor by benjamin gramm

separate from some of the other considerations such as the legality it is likely going to be worth your will if you employer has company matching even if you have to pay the early withdraw penalty because the matching funds from your employer can be viewed as gains on the money deposited for example using round numbers to make the math easy no 401(k deposit with 401(k deposit so as you can see there is a benefit to deferring some of the earnings to the 401(k account due to the employer matching but the actual dollar amount that you would be able to take home will be different based upon your own circumstances depending upon what the take home would be at the end of the day the percentage return may or may not be worth the time involved with doing the paperwork however all of this only applies if you have to pull the money out early as once you hit 59.5 years old you can start withdrawing the money without the tax penalty in which case the returns on your initial deposit will be much more

so if i understand your plan right this will be your situation after the house is bought total debt here 's what i would do wait until your house sells before buying a new one   that way you can take the equity from that sale and apply it towards the down payment rather than taking a loan on your retirement account    if something happens and your house does n't sell for as as you think it will you 'll lose out on the gains from the amount you borrow which will more than offset the interest you are paying yourself at worst pay off the 401(k loan the instant your sale closes take as much of the remaining equity as you can and start paying down student loans   there are several reasons why they are a higher priority than a mortgage some are mathematical some are not should i look to pay off student loans sooner even if i refi at a lower rate of 3.5 or so or the mortgage earlier    my thoughts are that the student loans follow me for life but i can always sell and buy another home so you want this baggage for the rest of your life   how will it be when you get that off your back   how much investing are you missing out on because of student loan payments   what happens if you get lose your license   what if you become disabled   student loans are not but you can always sell the asset behind a mortgage or car loan   they are worse than credit card debt in that sense   you have no tangible asset behind it and no option for forgiveness unless you decide to practice in a high need area but i do n't get the sense that that 's your path the difference in interest is generally only a few payment worth over 15 years is the interest amortized the same as a 15 year if i pay a 30 year mortgage in 15 years   yes however the temptation to just pay it off over 30 years is still there   how often will you decide that a bigger car payment or a vacation or something else is more important   with a 15-year note you lock in a plan and stick to it some other options

my theory is that the massive swell of fear from 2008 until now has made people realize that they are never safe and that debt is the killer    when private sector incomes drop loss of job less consumer demand etc we can not afford to service our debt and this leads to catastrophic default with assets being lost to creditors on the other hand if you own your assets outright a significant and long lasting drop in income can usually be sustained or at least the assets are not lost   in a time of high risk to income like now it is better to pay down debt even if it means tightening the budget a bit better to lose some business utility now than to lose it all later to creditors   thanks for the post there is some interesting info in here i also find it interesting that these world class economists are presenting these horribly ugly excel graphs

the odd thing about primary school education that i hear from talking to teachers is that the materials used in the classroom are all bought under some sort of district wide or even state wide in the case of texas decision for which program to use for reading they generally include a set of books or single book with a sequence of things to be taught teacher 's who 've been teaching for a long time will know which series has useful properties for teaching the material they might refer to them by names but it really just comes down to a set of materials and sequence of introducing material when one teacher says to another i used $ x to supplement the required $ y it 'd be like a software engineer saying i used a hash map instead of a map for that case because it had better performance for the use case there 's a fair amount of baggage in the statement but another software engineer would understand the differences and know what tradeoffs were being made   as to the master 's in reading there 's a lot of goofy degrees offered through the education departments at state schools a large part of it is because the union pay scales include things like education level they tend to be equivalent to any terminal masters program you 'd find in other subjects including mba take these classes part time and summers over the next 3 years and if you pass them all we give you a piece of paper that says masters of education reading or similar it comes down to something like 45 credit hours with a focus on something   gt basically he she just wants to work a program by a semi mindless rote and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them   i actually doubt that it 's going to come down to the sets of materials they have available for teaching some work some do n't the structure of the system discourages unfortunately and the teachers often feel that they have their hands tied

technically the difference between dividends and growth ought to be that dividends can be reinvested in stocks other than the one that paid them which is a definite advantage if you actually have a strategy   dividend stocks used to be preferred for exactly that reason back in the days when fewer people were directly playing in the market and more knew what they were doing unfortunately   getting a periodic dividend from a stock whose price is relatively steady is n't as exciting a game as watching your stock 's value bounce around and hopefully   creep upward on a second by second basis those who are thinking in gambling terms rather than investment terms or who think they can beat the pros at high frequency trading comment withheld want the latter and have been putting a lot of pressure on companies to operate in the latter mode that does n't make it better certainly not for the longer term investors just more fashionable and fashion often means getting stuck with something impractical because everyone else is doing it on this i second scrooge

the current stock price you 're referring to is actually the price of the last trade   it is a historical price but during market hours that 's usually mere seconds ago for very liquid stocks whereas the bid and ask are the best potential prices that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at the bid for the buying side and the ask for the selling side   but think of the bid and ask prices you see as tip of the iceberg prices   that is the bid is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $ for up to 200 shares   their bids are the highest currently bid and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices   so the bid you 're seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment   if you entered a market order to sell more than 200 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price the ask is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $ for up to 1000 shares   their ask prices are the lowest currently asked and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices   so the ask you 're seeing is the best asking price at that moment   if you entered a market order to buy more than 1000 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price a transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders note there are primarily two kinds of stock exchanges   the one i just described is a typical order driven matched bargain market and perhaps the kind you 're referring to the other kind is a quote driven over the counter market where there is a market maker as johnfx already mentioned   in those cases the spread between the bid ask goes to the market maker as compensation for making a market in a stock   for a liquid stock that is easy for the market maker to turn around and buy sell to somebody else the spread is small narrow   for illiquid stocks that are harder to deal in the spread is larger wide to compensate the market maker having to potentially carry the stock in inventory for some period of time during which there 's a risk to him if it moves in the wrong direction     finally if you wanted to buy 1000 shares you could enter a market order in which case as described above you 'll pay $   if you wanted to buy your shares at no more than $ instead i.e. the so called current price then you would enter a limit order for 1000 shares at $   and more to the point your order would become the new highest bid price until somebody else accepts your bid for their shares   of course there 's no guarantee that with a limit order that you will get filled your order could expire at the end of the day if nobody accepts your bid

in the theater it 's a person who can afford to buy expensive pop corn cause he can buy the expensive movie ticket too also sitting at one place will make him feel hungry and buy something to eat so maximum chances are that in the theater that guy is your potential customer otherwise if the popcorn seller is somewhere outside the theater they may charge you less that 's because of a different target audience they would be targeting anyone who comes near the theater who would not be willing to pay for expensive snacks or movie tickets so very few customers around will be actually potential customers to maximize their profits they will keep the prices low and supply as much as they can i know this is going against the normal price elasticity of demand and supply graph but if the prices are low there will be high demand so if the is more than 1 the supplier should supply as much as they can to maximize profits its all based on the target audience that 's what i think should be the case of expensive popcorn in movie theaters

investopedia states while early exercise is generally not advisable because the time    value inherent in the option premium is lost upon doing so there are    certain circumstances under which early exercise may be advantageous    for example an investor may choose to exercise a call option that is    deeply in the money such an option will have negligible time value    just before the ex dividend date of the underlying stock this will    enable the investor to capture the dividend paid by the underlying    stock which should more than offset the marginal time value lost due    to early exercise so the question is how well do you see the time value factor here

their shifting strategies from simply a medium to provide content that others have made to a content producer   that takes money   as long as the investments pay off and they pay their debts on time its should be fine   ultimately i think they have no choice as content is increasingly streamed from the internet   what need to content producers like hbo need from content providers like comcast and netflix   people can buy hbo directly and watch it as long as they have an internet connection   netflix does n't provide internet or communications infrastructure like comcast and verizon and they were n't a content producer so they were going to be obsolete soon   producing and owning content that others want to purchase and using that content as a way to make the netflix platform more valuable to other content producers seems like a good strategy to me   i actually do n't think they have a choice   they still may not make it and my bust but using debt to pay for the strategy they have decided on is not going to be the reason they fold   its just a means to an end and its one of the only means they have available right now

the basic theoretical reason for a company to return money to shareholders is that the company does n't need the money for its own purposes e.g. investment or working capital so instead of the company just keeping it in the bank it hands it back so that shareholders can do what they think fit e.g. investing it elsewhere in some cases particularly private equity deals you see companies actively borrowing money to payout to shareholders on the grounds that they can do so cheaply enough that it will improve overall shareholder returns the trade off with this kind of leveraging up is that it usually makes the business more risky and every so often you see it go wrong e.g. after an economic downturn it may still be a rational thing to do but i 'd look at that kind of proposal very carefully in this case i think things are quite different the company has sold a valuable asset and has spare cash it 's already going to use some of the money to reduce debt so it does n't seem like the company is becoming more risky overall if the management is recommending it i would support it as you say the share consolidation seems like just a technical measure and you might as well also support that i think they want to make their share price seem stable over time to people who are looking at it casually and wo n't be aware of the payout otherwise it 'd suddenly drop by and might give the impression the company had some bad news the plan is to essentially cancel one share worth for every payout they make on 16 shares since = payout this should leave the share price broadly unchanged

banks are in it to make money but they 're expected to provide a social good which powers our economy secure money storage bank accounts and cashless transactions credit debit cards   and the government does not subsidize this   in fact banks are being squeezed prudent customers dislike paying the proper cost of their account 's maintenance say a $ fee for a credit card or $ for a checking account they want it free   meanwhile government is pretty aggressive about preventing fine print trickery that would let them recover costs other ways   however there is n't much sympathy for consumers who make trivial mistakes whether they be technical overdraft late fee or money management mistakes like doing balance transfers or getting fooled by promotional interest rates   so that 's where banks are able to make their money when people are imprudent   the upshot is that it 's hard for a bank to make money on a prudent careful customer those end up getting subsidized by the less careful customers who pay fees and buy high margin products like balance transfers   and this has created a perverse incentive banks make more money when they actively encourage customers to be imprudent   here the 0 interest is to make you about running up a balance or doing balance transfers at a barely mentioned fee of 3 5 they know most americans do n't have $ 500 in the bank and you wo n't be able to promptly pay it off right before the 0 rate ends   or you 'll forget   and this works that 's why they do it    by law you already get 0 interest on purchases when you pay the card in full every month   so if that 's your goal you already have it   in theory the banks collect about 1.5 from every transaction you do and certainly in your mind 's eye you 'd think that would be enough to get by without charging interest   that does n't work though   the problem is such a no interest card would attract people who carry large balances   that would have two negative impacts first the bank would have to spend money and second the bank would have huge exposure to credit card defaults    the thing to remember is the banks are not nice guys and are not here to serve   you   they 're here to use you to make money and they 're not beneath encouraging you to do things that are actually bad for you caveat emptor

coins are legal tender they 're authorized by governments and have a face value rounds are simply coined pieces of metal minted by private manufacturers they do not have any face value and are not legal tender rounds are used to own metal they have no value other than the value of the metal in them any premium you pay over the price of the metal is the mint 's profit coins are also used as i.e. to own metal and create profits for the government but many times coins have limited issue and become valuable because of the rarity specific issues with a specific coin mistakes impurities exclusive designs etc so they also may have some value depends on the specific coin coins also have the assurance of quality of the authorizing government and are dealt with by the law as forgery of coins is illegal and is a crime rounds however do not enjoy such protection and any one can mint them only copyright trademark protections apply where the enforcement is by the owner and not the government re the advantages coins if you pick the right ones appreciate much more than the metal however this is mostly in hindsight and most of the coins do not appreciate significantly beyond the price of the metal unless there 's something else significant about them first year of issue high quality certification etc rounds on the other hand are cheaper 1 oz round will be significantly cheaper than 1 oz coin and monitor more closely the price of the metal it is unlikely for rounds to significantly deviate from the spot price although this does happen occasionally for specific designs or if a mint goes out of business

you may also want to consider delaware and nevada as possible corporate homes   they are common choices for out of state corporations   you may find that they are better options    will earnings prior to forming the llc have to be claimed as self employment income if so would it be easier to wait until the next calendar year to form the llc earnings after forming the limited liability corporation llc will probably have to be claimed as self employment income   see how llc members are taxed for more discussion   in particular read the section on self employment taxes    the current rule is that any owner who works in or helps manage the business must pay this tax on his or her share rightful share of profits however owners who are not active in the llc that is those who have merely invested money but do n't provide services or make management decisions for the llc may be exempt from paying self employment taxes on their share of profits the regulations in this area are a bit complicated but if you actively manage or work in your llc you can expect to pay self employment tax on all llc profits allocated to you as i read it you actively work in the llc so it is unlikely that you can avoid paying self employment taxes   so it should n't make any difference when you officially start an llc   you 'll have to pay self employment taxes before and after creating the llc regardless    if you do n't want to pay self employment taxes you may want to consider forming a subchapter c corporation   they do n't have the same tax structure as subchapter s corporations or llcs   you would be paid some kind of wage salary or commission and the corporation would pay the employer 's side of the payroll taxes    note that subchapter s corporations and llcs exist because they usually pay less in tax than subchapter c corporations do   even including the self employment taxes that you owe    a cpa should be able to guide you in making these decisions and help you with setup    the one time that i started a corporation i just paid a few hundred dollars to a service and they filed the paperwork for me   that included state fees and notice costs   the cpa probably has a service association already

because most of the posters have the pursuit of silver without a reflection upon what you wrote in the question your concern about hungary and its government i 'll weigh in it   in a stable and solid political and economic environment this advice against silver would be generally correct   as you commented though this has not been the case and thus it is difficult for some to understand this given your concerns here 's a question to reflect upon what can the government of hungary not confiscate   or what have they not confiscated in the past   if silver is on that list then very few people here will understand because statements like to be honest i think a lot of people on this site are doing you a disservice by taking your idea as seriously as they are are completely predicated on an environment that has been relatively stable over the years   i know my fellow americans and some europeans do n't get this but some countries have seen disasters for instance brazil has been hyperinflation even when interest rates with insane interest rates over 1000 so this answer wo n't be popular but depending on your environment silver may be an excellent choice   if the government of hungary has confiscated silver in the past or you suspect they might though i 'd stay far away from it   in reading and listening to people in these environments citizens typically want something the government does want to take inventory of that tend to hold their value or rise during times of crisis   most americans if they were honest really ca n't relate to this and the few that can would agree   another popular item to have which does n't physically exist is a rare but valuable skill that will be needed in a crisis   for instance being highly skilled at negotiation and knowing the right people both come in handy at difficult times   can you pay for learning or increasing those skill sets now   never forget that self investment can go far and as a financial note and word of advice from someone who 's been a financial adviser for over half a decade a good financial adviser always seeks to get the person 's information before providing advice and almost never says that a particular choice is always bad or always good i would seldom say that a person should do one thing and it will always be good advice because that may not work in their country state environment situation etc   as they say in the sql server community it depends and that holds true for finance   in the long run those items which we may not think of as good investments or stores of value may end up having their day   to paraphrase solomon there 's a time and place for everything under the sun   even in my short life i 've witnessed a period of gold and silver routing the stock market and the stock market routing gold and silver   i suspect i 'll see both again if i live a few more decades tl;dr

i think it would be a wise move on the part of the 3d printing small businesses if contingency plans were put in place plan on alternate locations with backup printers or better yet print offsite in several locations and employ to transport the parts to the final customer a mechanism is much harder to squash and if a business starts by using satellite printers in the first place it 's much easier to bring previously unused resources online in the event of a disruption better yet subcontract the printing to individuals around your area that have the capabilities giving them a steady stream of income in return for a reduced rate i anticipate demand for this sort of service will pick up as both variety of materials and performance characteristics of output products improves this will last until 3d printing is so ubiquitous that and hp are selling units as cheaply as you buy printers now by that time smart printing services will have figured out alternative ways to stay in business instead of fighting to stay on top just like the older business models they

it is not clear to me why you believe you can lose more than you put in without margin it is difficult and the chances are virtually nil however i can think of a few ways lets say you are an american and deposit $ 1000 now lets say you think the indian rupee is going to devalue relative to the euro so that means you want to go long going long without margin is still different than converting your into euros assume = 72 what s actually happening is your broker is taking out a 72,000 rupee loan and using it to buy euros with your $ 1000 acting as collateral you will need to pay interest on this loan about 7 annualized if i remember correctly you will earn interest on the euros you hold in the meantime for simplicity lets say its 1 the difference between interest you earn and interest you pay is called the cost of carry or commonly referred to as swap so your annualized cost of carry is $ 60 $ lets say you have this position open for 1 year and the exchange rate does nt move your total equity is $ now lets say an destroys all of europe your euros instantly become worthless you now must repay the rupee loan to close the trade the cost of which is $ 1000 but you only have $ in your account you have lost more than you deposited using no margin i would actually say that all buying and selling of currency pairs is inherently using margin because they all involve a short sale i do note that depending on your broker you can convert to another currency but that s not what forex traders do most of the time

it is illegal because laws are written by people and laws of stock trade are written in part to make it appear fair and thus contribute to the willingness of the people to invest their money in that particular venue profiting from information on the stock market that some people have and some ca n't have is considered unfair since it presumably excludes the latter from profit making opportunities and thus makes their trades less profitable than otherwise since it is universally felt so people made laws that prohibit such behavior   i am not aware of any research that shows beyond doubt that allowing insider trading would really ruin stock markets but such thing would be very hard to prove there are arguments to both sides and the side that supports prohibiting such trade has a clear majority so it is prohibited

for the period 1950 to 2009 if you adjust the s&p 500 for inflation and account for dividends the average annual return comes out to exactly source currently inflation is around 2   so your 2 apy is a 0 real return where the stock market return is 7   i.e. on average stocks have a return that is higher by 7    if you mix in bonds 70 stocks to 30 bonds your real returns will drop to around 5.5 but you are safer in individual years bonds often have good years when stocks have bad years    we 're making a bit of a false dichotomy here   we 're talking about returns on stocks in retirement accounts versus returns on cds in regular accounts   you can buy stocks in regular accounts and it is legally possible to have a cd in a retirement account   so you can get bankruptcy protection and tax advantages with a cd

i think swenson 's insight was that the traditional recommendation of 60 stocks plus 40 bonds has two serious flaws 1 you are exposed to way too much risk by having a portfolio that is so strongly tied to us equities especially in the way it has historically been recommend 2 you have too little reward by investing so much of your portfolio in bonds if you can mix a decent number of asset classes that all have equity like returns and those asset classes have a low correlation with each other then you can achieve equity like returns without the equity like risk this improvement can be explicitly measured in the sharpe ratio of you portfolio the vanguard risk factor looks pretty and lame to me the book the the ivy portfolio does a great job at covering the swenson model and explains how to reasonably replicate it yourself using low fee etfs

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

personally i 'd use my emergency fund first it is unlikely though possible of course that i will entirely lose my income at the same time i need to replace my roof or my furnace i 'd rather pay my emergency fund back with installment payments than pay off a heloc to my bank the lost interest on my emergency fund which after all should be in cash is much less than the cost of the loan i could even set up an amortization schedule in a spreadsheet and charge myself interest when paying back into the emergency fund that said if i did n't have the cash in my emergency fund i 'd rather borrow against the house than finance with a contractor if they 'd even do that which is unlikely i've never dealt with a roofer or heating contractor that required anything but full payment at time of service home equity borrowing is generally the cheapest kind i 'm firmly in the camp of those who look at home ownership as a consumption decision rather than an investment if the value goes up great but i just build in about 1 of the cost of building a new house excluding the land price into the housing budget each year right along with mortgage interest property taxes and basic utilities usually that 's enough to cover the major wear and tear related repairs averaged over 3 5 year periods anyway

as a venezuelan who used to buy usd i believe there is not better explanation than the one given to someone who actually lives and works here in venezuela back in 1998 when took the presidency we had a good economy fast forward 10 years and you could see how poor management corruption and   communist measurements had havoc in our economy it was because most of the money usd coming in venezuela were not invested here but instead given away to countries like cuba remember communism lasts while you have money back then we had an oil barrel going over 100 $ and crazy amounts of money were coming in the country however little to no money was invested in the country itself that is why some of the richest people with bank account in swiss are who stole huge amounts of oil money   i know this is a lot to take in but all of this led to venezuelan economy being the worst in the american continent and because there is not enough money inside the country to satisfy the inner market people would pay to have anything that is bought abroad you have to consider that only a very small amount of people can actually buy usd here in venezuela back in 2013 i was doing it i could buy about 80 usd month with my monthly income however that 's nearly impossible for about 99 of   to illustrate minimum wage = 10.000 month black market exchange rate as of january 2016 = per = usd    < < < that is what about 50 of earn every month that 's why this happens   the guy is holding a huge stack of money of the highest venezuelan note which he got from exchanging only 100 usd i am a computer science engineer the monthly income for someone like me is about so that is about 34 $ a month oh dear so finally answering your question q why do people buy usd even at this unfavorable rate a there are many reasons but being the main 2 the following inflation in venezuela is crazy high the inflation from 2014 2015 was which means that having the venezuelan currency in your bank account makes no sense in two weeks you wo n't be able to buy half of the things you used to with the same amount of money a huge amount of dream with living abroad me included why you ask well sir it is certain that life in this country is not the best i hope you can understand better why people in 3rd world countries and crappy economies buy usd even at an unfavorable rate the last question was q why would venezuela want to block the sale of dollars a centralized currency management is an economic measure that should last 6 months tops this was argentina 's case in 2013 but at this point reverting that would take quite a few years   however 's wikipedia link explains that very well regards

during the settlement period the buyer transfers payment to the seller and the seller transfers ownership to the buyer this is really a from the days when so much of stock trading was done by individual human traders and computers were still not a huge part of the operation   back then paper tickets for trades exchanged hands and the time period was actually 5 days so 3 days is an improvement    a settlement period was necessary for everyone to figure out their trades and do what was necessary to make the settlements happen so it was not always a quick process mainly because of smaller trading firms that did n't have technology to help them along nowadays technology makes settlements easy and they usually occur at the end of the trading day   the trading firms sum up their trades figure out who they owe and send lump sum settlements to the counterparties to their trades   if anything the period may just be used now to let parties verify trades before settling i hope this helps good luck

my first thought was that it must be due to inflation which causes such differences in many cases since a creditor needs to make back more than the rate of inflation in order not to effectively lose money but it seems that currently has only a very modest rate of inflation about 3 other possible reasons for different credit rates the latter is most likely it means that if debtors are generally poor and are often completely unable to pay back the loan or if there is no effective way to force debtors to pay e.g. when there are weak laws or overworked courts then creditors will lose a lot of money to defaults and have to raise rates to compensate for this

then we do agree in a sense pensions are an in the modern economy and likely were never a good idea that said i do not agree with putting those owed and promised pensions behind other creditors you would not bring down the credit system you would simply kill what is left of the seriously broken pensions system and punish any company that was fool enough to play games with their pension system    all that said i am not against a bankruptcy court discharging pensions and saying tough to the employees i just want that consideration by the court to happen when whatever is left of the cash pile is still big enough to matter to the pensioners   if you are a company dumb enough to operate such a system today i see no reason why your creditors should not be aware of the promised debt load you carry that is bound up in your employees and take it into account does it make credit more expensive for them it better

beers i can see the math which you are right about my point is that the republicans were voting to favor the banking lobby over the lobby and the dems were voting to favor the lobby over the lobby   i believe that neither party at large was voting for the consumer   i concede that some individual dems may have been voting for consumers but overall this vote came down to bankers vs. lawyers the two potential primary beneficiaries of the outcome

the idea behind investing in index funds is that you will not under perform the market but also at the same time not over perform against the market either it is meant for those majority of the investing population who do not or can not invest more time in actively researching different investment options so even considering for a moment that the yields on the index funds will drop significantly in the future since the fund is supposed to be replication of the whole market itself the market too can be assumed to be giving significantly lower future yields in my opinion the question that you ask is confusing contradictory because its like pegging the fund performance to an avg and then asking if it will be higher or lower in the future but rather its always going to be exactly the average even if the absolute yields turn higher or lower

as others have said it depends entirely on what benefits are provided and how much of the cost of those benefits is paid by the employer and how much is paid by the employee and compare that to what it would cost to obtain the necessary equivalent coverage without employer assistance in my case my employer pays more than $ 10,000 per year toward the cost of medical dental vision disability and life insurance for myself and my family that 's almost 20 of the average total household income in my state so it is not an insignificant amount at all

another reason flexibility and liquidity   there is a fundamental difference between installment and revolving debt such that it could be rational to pay revolving debt before an amortizing loan    lets say you have 100 k in cash a 100 k mortgage at 4 and 4 25 k credit cards at maximum balance and a 0 promotional rate at least for now    if you pay off the mortgage you may not get liquidity if you need it   this path is not necessarily reversible    if you pay off the credit cards you have 100 k of credit available to you   you can reverse to the case of having 100 k in cash and 200 k in debt

your contributions that you 've already made are made and done and will not disappear what the windfall elimination provision does is make sure that people do not collect the subsidized low income payments while also collecting a full pension   people who did not pay anything into ss are able to collect money less but still something from the system   prior to this provision people on full pensions who were exempt from ss contributions such as teachers in many places were able to still collect those amounts which were never earned through contributions even though they had quite significant pensions that led to subsidies being given to people that did n't have as much need for them as opposed to the indigent people who did need them in your case earning for 20 + years and then presumably only earning a small pension you may be affected by this but not necessarily severely    first of all you are limited in how much your total reduction is to the lesser of a bit over $ 400 $ in 2015 or half your pension amount per month so if you earn a $ 200 in pension monthly your ss benefits are reduced by $ 100 monthly at most second your percentage and total cap is reduced if you have over 20 years of credited work at 62 by 10 per credited year and if you hit 30 years it 's eliminated   so if you have 25 years right now your total reduction is more like $ 200 at most you also have an option to keep earning via credited work   do some part time work or summer work for example   sell things online   whatever you need to do in order to get more years of credited work such that you end up with 30 years at 62   that will then increase your benefits back to the full amount this article published on nasdaq 's website explains how this works in detail including tables of benefit reductions   and log in to to check how many years of coverage you have and to see if you can get to 30 years and avoid any issues with this at all

having spent all of 3 minutes reading about this my impression is insurers are going to have to have more money on hand to cover every line of business as independent silos instead of keeping it all pooled together and being able to shift money around as needed between their lines of business   in order to acquire this capital they will take on more debt now as the expectation is interest rates will rise in the future which would increase their cost of debt vs. acquiring the debt now when interest rates are low

i have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term because on average they go up 5 7 every year this has been true for the last 100 years for the s&p500 index but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future it has also been wrong for 20 + year time periods during those last 100 years it 's an average and you can live your whole career at a loss there are many things to support the retention of the average over the next 100 years i think the is out of scope of your actual investment philosophy but basically there are many ways to lower your cost basis by reinvesting dividends selling options or contributing to your position at any price from a portion of your income and by inflation and by the growth of the world economy with a low enough cost basis then a smaller percentage gain in the index gives you a magnified profit

some of the other answers recommended peer to peer lending and property markets i would not invest in either of these firstly peer to peer lending is not a traditional investment and we may not have enough historical data for the risk to return ratio secondly property investments have a great risk unless you diversify which requires a huge portfolio crowd funding for one property is not a traditional investment and may have drawbacks for example what if you disagree with other crowd about the required repairs for the property if you invest in the property market i recommend a well diversified fund that owns many properties beware of high debt leverage used to enhance returns and at the same time risk and high fees when selecting a fund however traditionally it has been a better choice to invest in stocks than to invest in property market beware of anyone who says that the property market is too good to not get into without specifying which part of the world is meant note also that many companies invest in properties so if you invest only in a well diversified stock index fund you may already have property investments in your portfolio however in your case i would keep the money in risk free assets i.e. bank savings or a genuine low cost money market fund i.e. one that does n't invest in corporate debt or in variable rate loans which have short duration but long maturity the reason is that you 're going to be unemployed soon and thus you may need the money soon if you have an investment horizon of say 10 years then i would throw stocks into the mix and if you 're saving for retirement then i would go all in to stocks in the part of the world where i live in money market funds generally have better return than bank savings and better diversification too however your 2.8 interest sounds rather high the money market fund i have in the past invested in currently yields at 0.02 but then again i live in the eurozone so be sure to get estimates for the yields of different risk free assets so my advice for investing is simple risk free assets for short time horizon a mixture of stocks and risk free assets for medium time horizon and only stocks for long time horizon in any case you need a small emergency fund too which you should consider a thing separate from your investments my emergency fund is 20 000 eur your 50 000 aud is bit more than 30 000 eur so you do n't really have that much money to invest only a bit more than a reasonably sized emergency fund but then again i live in rental property so my expenses are probably higher than yours if you can foresee a very long time horizon for part of your investment you could perhaps invest 50 of your money to stocks preference being a geographically diversified index fund or a number of index funds but i would n't invest more because of the need for an emergency fund

at its heart i think the best spirit of donation is helping others less fortunate than yourself but as long as the us remains solvent the chief benefit of paying down the national debt is like paying off a credit card lowering the future interest payments the u.s. taxpayer has to make since the wealthy pay a disproportionately large portion of taxes per capita your hard earned money would be disproportionately benefitting the wealthy so i 'd recommend you do one or both of the following instead target your donations to a charity whose average beneficiary is less fortunate than yourself take political action with an aim towards balancing the federal budget since the us national debt is principally financed in the form of 30 year treasuries the u.s. will be completely out of debt if it can maintain a balanced budget for 30 years see below

this seems almost overkill but if you want to i suppose one thing you could do is create a separate money in transit account similar to account payable and account receivable in your bookkeeping transfer the money from the source account to the holding account on the date that the source bank withdraws it and then transfer the money to the destination account on the date that the target bank deposits it this both makes it clear that there is money going between places and ensures that the daily balance on each physical account is accurate for cash withdrawals and deposits i 'd just use the date when you make the withdrawal since that is the day from which the money is available in the new location rather than the old one note i do n't know if this is the proper way to do it in a random jurisdiction but i doubt being this explicit can get you into trouble

which strategy makes more sense check your new fidelity 401k plan make sure it has a good group of funds available at very low fees if it does roll over your principal 401k to your new 401k call principal and have them transfer the funds directly to fidelity do not have them send you a check if the new plan does n't have a good fund lineup or has high fees create a rollover ira and roll your old 401k plan into it again have principal transfer the funds directly consider using vanguard or other very low cost funds in your ira taking the money out of your old 401k to pay toward your mortgage has several disadvantages you will pay taxes and a penalty your mortgage rate is very good and since you are probably in a high tax bracket and perhaps itemize deductions the effective rate is even less and you lose liquidity that might come in handy down the road you can always change your mind later but for now do n't pay down your mortgage using your 401k money as a result of being under 20 i am paying mortgage insurance of    about $ 300/mo this is wasted money save aggressively and get your mortgage down to 80 so that you can get rid of that pmi if you are earning a high salary you should be able to get there in reasonably short order if you are maxing out your 401k $ 18,000 per year you might be better off putting it on pause and instead using that money to get rid of the pmi i have no retirement plans because i enjoy working and have plans to    start a company and essentially will be happy working until i die you are young your life will change over time everyone young seems to choose one of two extremes   in the end very few choose either of these paths for now just plan on retiring somewhere close to normal retirement age you can always change your plans later

they could if they wanted it 's of course illegal to do if you did n't authorize it and to process credit cards they need to have a relationship with a credit card processing company which is not so easy to fake not any joe could do that using a fake id note that you are protected through your credit card company if you tell them it 's an unauthorized charge they 'll return it to you without discussion it is then the vendor 's duty to prove that it was authorized and if he can not he 'll pay extra fees to the processing company overall the risk is very small it should n't be your worry

it may seem weird but interest rates are set by a market risk is a very large component of the price that a saver will accept to deposit their money in a bank but not the only one essentially you are lending deposited cash to the bank that you put it in and they will lend it out at a certain risk to themselves and a certain risk to you by diversifying who they lend to corporations home buyers each other etc the banks mitigate a lot of the risk but lending to the bank is still a risky endeavour for the saver and the saver accepts a given interest rate for the amount of risk there is in having the money in that particular bank the bank is also unable to diversify away all possible risk but tries to do the best job it can if a bank is seen to take bigger risks and therefore be in greater risk of failing having a run on deposits it must have a higher interest rates on deposits compared to a lower risk bank savers therefore shop around for the best interest rate for a given level of risk which sets the viable interest rate for that bank any higher and the bank would not make a profit on the money that it lends out and so would not be viable as a business any lower and savers would not deposit their money as the risk would be too high for the reward hence competition or lack of it will set the rate as a trade off between risk and return note that governments are also customers of the banking industry when they are issuing fixed income securities bonds and a good deal of the lending done by any bank is to various governments so the price that they borrow money at is a key determinant of what interest rate the bank can afford to give and are part of the competitive banking industry whether they want to be or not since governments in most countries provide insurance for deposits the basic level of perceived risk for all of the banks in any given country is about the same that these banks lend to each other on an incredibly regular basis look into the overnight or repo money market if you want to see exactly how much the rates that these banks pay to and receive from each other are governed by interbank lending rates called libor and and are even more complicated than this answer simply compounds this effect because it makes all of the banks reliant on each other and therefore they help each other to stay liquid to some extent note that i have n't mentioned currency at all so far but this market in every country applies over a number of currencies the way that this occurs is due to arbitrage if i can put foreign money into a bank in a country at a rate that is higher than the rate in its native country after exchange costs and exchange rate risk i will convert all of my money to that currency and take the higher interest rate for an ordinary individual 's savings that is not really possible but remember that the large multinational banks can do exactly the same thing with billions of dollars of deposits and effectively get free money this means that either the bank 's interest rate will fall to a risk adjusted level or the exchange rate will move either of those moves will remove the potential for making money for nothing in this case therefore it is both the exchange rate risk and costs as well as the loan market in that country that set the interest rate in foreign currencies demand for loans in the foreign currency is not a major mover for the same reason companies importing from foreign entities need cash in foreign currencies to pay their bills and so will borrow money in other currencies to fulfil these operations which could come from deposits in the foreign currency if they were available at a lower interest rate than a loan in local currency plus the costs of exchange but the banks will be unwilling to loan to them for less than the highest return that they can get so will push up interest rates to their risk level in the same way that they did in the market before currencies were taken into account freedom of movement of foreign currencies however does move interest rates in foreign currencies as the banks want to be able to lend as much of currencies that are not freely deliverable as they can so will pay a premium for these currencies other political moves such as the government wanting to borrow large amounts of foreign currency etc will also move the interest rate given for foreign currencies not just because loaning to the government is less risky but also because they sometimes pay a premium in interest for being able to borrow foreign currency which may balance this out speculation that a country may change its base interest rate will move short term rates and can move long term rates if it is seen to be a part of a country 's economic strategy the theory behind this is deep and involved but the tl;dr answer would be the standard invisible hand response when anything market or arbitrage related is involved references i work in credit risk and got a colleague who is also a credit risk consultant and economist to look over it arbitrage theory and the repo markets are both fascinating so worth reading about

if you are trading cfds which are usually traded on margin you will usually be charged an overnight financing fee for long positions held overnight and you will receive an overnight financing credit for short positions held overnight most cfd brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at + or 2.5 or 3 from the country 's official interest rates so if your country 's official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses + or 2.5 you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight in australia the official interest rate is 2.5 so i get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight if you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using cfds to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time these financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions if you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees

i 'm not a financial expert but saying that paying a $ 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by $ 1 sounds like awfully simple minded reasoning to me it appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares but that simply is n't true you do n't even need to do any in depth analysis to prove it just look at share prices over a few days you should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly if say a company becomes the target of a federal investigation the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made did the company 's assets really disappear that day no what 's happened is that the company 's long term prospects are now in doubt or a company announces a promising new product the share price shoots up they may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet they have n't made a dollar but their future prospects now look improved many factors go into determining a stock price sure total assets is a factor but more important is anticipated future earning i think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends that stock is worthless the stock will never produce any profit to the owner so why should you be willing to pay anything for it one could say the value could go up and you could sell at a profit but on what basis would the value go up why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income update i think i understand the source of the confusion now so let me add to my answer suppose that a company 's stock is selling for say $ 10 and to simplify the discussion let 's suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend the company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of $ 1 per share this dividend is announced well in advance everyone knows that it will be paid and everyone is extremely that in fact the company really will pay it they wo n't run out of money or any such then in a pure market we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid it is $ 11 then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to $ 10 why because the person who owns the stock on the dividend day will get that $ 1 so if you bought the stock the day before the dividend the next day you would immediately receive $ 1 if without the dividend the stock is worth $ 10 then the day before the dividend the stock is worth $ 11 because you know that the next day you will get a $ 1 refund if you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid you will not get the $ 1 it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday so the value of the stock falls back to the normal $ 10 so if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid yes it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock which in many cases would totally mask this effect but this does not mean that the dividend is worthless just the opposite the reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value but it only has value to the person who gets it it does me no good that you get a $ 1 dividend i want me to get the money so if i buy the stock after the dividend was paid i missed my chance so sure in the very short term a stock loses value after paying a dividend but this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock just the opposite the price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the normal level without the dividend the price would never have gone up in the first place imagine you had a company with negligible assets for example an accounting firm that rents office space so it does n't own a building its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like so if the company liquidates it would be worth pretty much zero everybody knows that if liquidated the company would be worth zero further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never ever again pay a dividend maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because it 's products were declared hazardous or the company was built around one genius who just died etc what is the stock worth zero it is an investment that you know has a zero return why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it it 's no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends why would anyone else pay anything for this stock well unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that otherwise you 're supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme of course in real life there are usually uncertainties if a company is dying some people may believe rightly or wrongly that there is still hope of it etc do n't confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock they are related of course all else being equal a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets but you ca n't calculate the price of a company 's stock by adding up the value of all its assets subtracting liabilities and dividing by the number of shares that 's just not how it works long term the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends subject to all sorts of complexities in real life

this is dumb the sub company will lose money but the parent company will pay taxes on the income they made off of expenses to the   this does n't systematically reduce their risk either banks will loan more money if the parent company is liable to pay the bills if the sub company ca n't so yes a bank may make a loan to the sub company without any liability on the parent company but its going to be a very small loan compared to what they would've given the parent company

obama never helped with the debt on households as he promised   all the household debt due to homes with first and/or second mortgages that exceeded the value of the home was more or less by his program and other programs that were supposed to relieve households   so the debt was never addressed and is still being worked through as   millions of homeowners pay down mortgages   it 's going to continue for a few more years until people start building up equity again   this all affects the economy as consumers have less money to buy things with or maintain solvency as trillions are still being to finance companies and investors in real estate derivatives   for example a large part of the student loan bubble is due to this debt since many homeowners who would have in the past taken out tax deductible equity loans to finance their kids 's education can no longer do so   instead a portion of student debt is being carried by the kids themselves graduate under debt and ca n't buy their own homes or spend their paychecks for years or decades   there has been widespread non compliance among banks with obama 's program and other measures intended to provide homeowners from the housing bubble debt but the administration never followed through or engaged in enforcement actions that encouraged compliance   those programs were therefore ineffective and/or were always intended just to be window dressing or faux achievements   the banks are still raking in trillions of undue profits from overpriced mortgages created during the housing bubble their practices helped create   those trillions are coming out of the rest of the economy where the dollars would be better spent

hard pulls you give your explicit permission to run do affect your credit   soft pulls do not while hard pulls affect your score they do n't affect it much   maybe a couple few point for a little while   in your daily activities it is inconsequential   if you are prepping to get a mortgage you should be mindful similar type hard pulls in a certain time window will only count once because it is assume you are shopping   for example mortgage shopping will result in a lot of hard pulls but if they are all done in a fortnight they only count against once   i believe the time window is actually a month but i have always had two weeks in my head as the safe window the reason soft pulls do n't matter is because businesses typically wo n't make credit decisions based on them   a soft pull is so a business can find a list of people to make offers to but that does n't mean they actually qualify   only the information in a hard pull will tell them that   i do n't know but i suspect it is more along the lines of give me everybody who is between 600 and 800 and lives in zip code not what is 's credit score a hard pull will lower your score because of a scenario where you open up many many lines of credit in a short period of time   the credit scoring models assume i am guessing that you are going to implode   you are either attempting to cover obligations you ca n't handle or you are about to create a bunch of obligations you ca n't handle credit should be used as a convenient method of payment not a source of wealth   as such each credit line you open in a short time lowers the score   you are to continue opening lines and lenders at the end of your credit line opening spree will see you as riskier than the first

let 's look at some of your options in a savings account your $ 40,000 might be earning maybe 0.5 if you are lucky   in a year you 'll have earned $ 200   on the plus side you 'll have your $ 40,000 easily accessible to you to pay for moving closing costs on your new house etc if you apply it to your mortgage you are effectively saving the interest on the amount for the life of the loan   let 's say that the interest rate on your mortgage is 4   if you were staying in the house long term this interest would be compounded but since you are only going to be there for 1 year this move will save you $ 1600 in interest this year which means that when you sell the house and pay off this mortgage you 'll have $ 1600 extra in your pocket you said that you do n't like to dabble in stocks   i would n't recommend investing in individual stocks anyway   a stock mutual fund however is a great option for investing but only as a long term investment   you should be able to beat your 4 mortgage but only over the long term   if you want to have the $ 40,000 available to you in a year do n't invest in a mutual fund now i would lean toward option 2 applying the money to the mortgage   however there are some other considerations do you have any other debts maybe a car loan student loan or a credit card balance   if so i would forget everything else and put everything toward one or more of these loans first do you have an emergency fund in place or is this $ 40,000 all of the cash that you have available to you   one rule of thumb is that you have 3 to 6 months of expenses set aside in a safe easily accessible account ready to go if something comes up    are you saving for retirement   if you do n't already have retirement savings in place and are adding to it regularly some of this cash would be a great start to a roth ira or something like that invested in a stock mutual fund if you are already debt free except for this mortgage you might want to do some of each keep $ 10,000 in a savings account for an emergency fund if you do n't already have an emergency fund put $ 5,000 in a roth ira if you are n't already contributing a satisfactory amount to a retirement account and apply the rest toward your mortgage

you need to stop what you are doing right now and cut off contact with them this is an extremely common scam here 's how it works they give you a check maybe even a certified check usually in payment for something they are buying from you the check happens to be for more than the sales price they ask you to refund the difference and pressure you to do so quickly you will see why in a second the check deposits fine and the money shows up in your account assuming the bank would n't do that if it was n't a good check you let your guard down and pay them in a couple of weeks the bank that it is a fake check they remove the money from your account and may even report you for prosecution to local authorities for passing a fraudulent check   meanwhile the person has the money you gave them and you ca n't find them because they gave you a fake name to add insult to injury they may also have the property you sold them   you feel like a chump variants of this scam include them asking you to cash a check for them and you get to keep a part of the proceeds for your trouble sometimes it is presented as a work at home scheme   if you feel you absolutely must complete this deal and you should n't i would suggest you ask the person for a couple of forms of picture id and tell them you need to make sure they are n't a scammer and you are going to do a background check on them with your local police to protect yourself i predict the person will disappear and never contact you again about the money   also i suggest you talk to your bank immediately and inform them you think you might have been a victim of a scamming attempt so that you do n't look like an when this is all said and done

while jb king says some useful things i think there is another fundamental reason why stock markets go down after disasters either natural or man made   there is a real impact on the markets in the case of something like 9/11 due to closed airport higher security costs closer inspections on trade goods tighter restrictions on visas real payments for the rebuilding of destroyed buildings and insurance payouts for killed people and eventually the cost of a war but almost as important is the uncertainty and risk nobody knew what was going to happen in the days and weeks after an attack like that is there going to be another one a week later or every week for the next year will air travel become essentially impractical will international trade be severely restricted all those would have a huge massive effect on the economy you may argue that those things are very unlikely even after something like 9/11 but even a small increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic economic crash is enough to start people selling there is another thing that drives the market down even if most people are sure that there wo n't be a catastrophic economic crash they know that other people think there might be and so will sell that will drive the market down if they know the market is going down then sensible traders will start to sell even if they think there is zero risk of a crash this makes the effect worse eventually prices will drop so far that the people who do n't think there is a crash will start to buy so they can make a profit on the recovery but that usually does n't happen until there has been a substantial drop

i was recently terminated from a company that promoted its company culture as one of the of the perks there i can assure you that in many cases it is all a facade for any company claiming how amazing their culture is you can easily go to glassdoor and check out the reviews and get an idea of what the true company culture is like   at this particular company it was almost cult like in how they pushed the culture down your throats every monday was a monday and every department hold meetings after part of the was that dinner would be served every monday night catered from popular restaurants around the city most people do n't get home until 8 and most of them start 8 if you failed to show up for these 's you were an and managers often confront those that they noticed were not present    of course one of the big selling points of working at this company was the many perks they try to entice you with beer on tap on every floor free coffee and spa water tons of snacks on a weekly basis company events wellness programs etc of course they will often pay you 30 40 under the market rate for your skills in fact almost everyone i knew there have told me they took a pay cut to work for this company the company would also hold major annual corporate events namely a huge summer camp event where they will fly everyone in around from the world and spend 4 days at a weekend retreat there 's also an annual company summit where again the company flies everyone in to a location to hold a major conference all of these events however cuts into your actual vacation time as they subtract it away from your accrued vacation these events are mandatory for all employees to attend   underneath the facade of culture the management was extremely toxic if you did not drink the you were almost assuredly on your way out as this is an at will company i would often see people let go for the most stupid reasons if any were even given including myself anybody who concerns or had different ideas going against someone in charge were soon to be performance managed out of the company   i highly encourage anyone looking for a job to check out the prospective company 's glassdoor page it is a great resource and will truly give you an idea about what kind of ride you 'll be in for

your initial investment in this case is $ 9 on the first morning every other morning you are using part of your profits to buy the new piece of jewelry so you are actually not investing any new funds so each day you are effectively keeping $ 1 of your profits and investing $ 9 but your initial investment of your own funds is only the first $ 9 in other words if you only had $ 9 in the bank at the start of the year you could make $ 365 profits during the year and finish up with $ in the the bank at the end of the year

the cleanest way to accomplish this is to make the purchase of your new house contingent on the sale of your old one   your offer should include that contingency and a date by which your house needs to sell to settle the contract    there will also likely be a clause that lets the seller cancel the contract within a period of time like 24 48 hours if another offer is received   this gives you the buyer at least an opportunity to either sell the house or come up with financing to complete the deal for example suppose you make an offer to buy a house for $ 300,000 contingent on the sale of your house which the seller accepts   in the meantime the seller gets an offer of $ in cash no contingency   the seller has to notify you of the offer and give you some time to make good on your offer either by selling your house or obtaining $ 300,000 in financing   if you can not the seller can accept the cash offer this is just a hypothetical example the offer can have whatever clauses you agree to but since sale contingencies benefit the buyer the seller will generally want some compensation for that benefit e.g. a larger offer or some other clause that benefits them or do i find a house to buy first set a closing date far out and then use that time to sell my current one most sellers will not want to set a closing date very far out   contingency clauses are far more common in short yes it 's possible and any competent realtor should be able to handle it   it also may mean that you have to either make a higher offer to compensate for the contingency and to dissuade the seller from entertaining other offers or sell your home for less than you 'd like to get the cash sooner   you can weigh those costs against the cost of financing the new house until yours sells

in india as suggested above short long position can be taken either in f&o or spot market the f&o segment short long can be kept open for 3 months by taking position on the far contract in intra day spot market usually the position has to be squared at the end of day or the broker will square it during expiry forcibly however having said that it is a broker specific feature as per national stock exchange nse or stock exchange bse any transaction has to be settled at the end of t+2 days t being the trade day some brokers allow intra day positions to be open for t+1 or t+2 days as long as the margin is provided this is a broker specific discretion as the actual settlement is on t+2 or in some cases as the exchange specifies so in general to short a stock for a longer time f&o segment should be used

the fsa can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open   this also applies in case of a mid year change in election such as due to marriage divorce child birth etc for example according to this page you can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred so say you had $ 500 available from january to june then on july 1 had a qualifying event you then elected $ 2000   you can be reimbursed for up to $ 500 in expenses incurred prior to july 1 and then an additional $ 1500 in expenses incurred after up to $ 2000 if you did n't use your full $ 500 more specifically from the irs publication generally distributions from a health fsa must be paid     only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you     incurred during the period of coverage the hsa question is more complicated i would talk to a tax accountant or at minimum your benefits coordinator   also read the publication i linked above the first part is about hsas   the short answer to your specific question stop contributing to the hsa unless you were contributing well under the limit of the hsa   if you know your limit and you know you 're under it you can continue contributing until april 15 of next year if you fail to be an eligible individual during     2013 you can still make contributions up until april 15     2014 for the months you were an eligible individual the general rule is you can contribute up to of months you were eligible   so if you changed jobs oct 1 and you 're single then you could contribute or just over $ 2400 in total for the year   if you 've contributed less than that to date you may continue contributing up to that amount but again contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant as the rules can be complicated you definitely can not deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated and if you get it wrong you may owe a 10 penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong

's answer is spot on with the advice to avoid repeated conversions but i 'd like to provide some specifics on the fees involved each time you round trip canadian dollars cad through a u.s dollar usd priced security at td waterhouse and leave your proceeds in cad you 're paying a total foreign exchange fee implied in their rate   spread of about 3 give or take that 's ~3 per buy sell combination or on each end you can imagine if you trade back forth frequently you can quickly lose a lot of money   do it back and forth ten times in a year and you 're out ~30 on the fees alone the td u.s. money market fund that td waterhouse is referring to has no direct commission to buy or sell but it does have a management expense ratio mer of 0.20 per year basically a fee which is deducted from the fund 's returns which today are also close to zero   practically speaking that 's a very slim fee to hold some usd in your canadian dollar tfsa while 0.20 is cheap a point to keep in mind is if you maintain a significant usd balance you are maintaining currency risk   you can lose money in cad terms if the cad appreciates vs. usd additional references canadian capitalist describes td waterhouse and the use of and wash trades at how to wash your trade   he 's referring to rrsps but the same applies to tfsas which came out after the post was written canadian couch potato has two relevant articles are us listed etfs really cheaper and lowering your currency exchange fees

welcome to money se please forgive what might sound like a cliche how well do you sleep at night i mean specific to the mortgage there are those who are in a group who consider debt at any rate to be inherently bad and would not take on a 2 mortgage even if a different bank were offering 4 cds you just need to understand the risk   your mortgage cost after taxes may be if you are in the 25 bracket therefore your break even is for long term investments the recent lost decade had a return of for the full 10 year period this is just about the worst decade in modern history the average 10 year return is a cumulative 183 gain with a standard deviation of if a perfect bell curve this means that 1 10 year in 6 will give you a return under 45 in fact of the last 100 10 year periods 15 had returns less than 45 and just 8 were less than 30 right in line with the bell curve stats we always need to say past performance is no guarantee of future results yet when it comes to the market i use the s&p for my numbers by the way we do have history to give us an idea of the kind of volatility we might see over the years in my opinion your approach is sound and your returns very skewed to the positive the median 10 year return being vs your cost of money of 40 or so for a decade   it 's pretty easy to pull s&p data into a spreadsheet and analyze as you wish

it was a tough call    here 's what i think happened   they needed to use that 2.5 spectrum for something or risk losing it fcc mandates on the purchase of that spectrum lte was nowhere near ready for deployment so they had to go with wimax it was a good technology ready to go at the right time and far cheaper to deploy than lte but the spectrum was n't ideal for all environments they always planned on switching from wimax to lte at some point   unfortunately the infighting with delayed the rollout wimax did n't come to market soon enough and not enough people bought into it sprint saw this outcome as a possibility which is why the spun off their wimax assets into instead of proceeding with their original service they wanted to insulate sprint which also meant that could become a toxic asset probably was n't very happy with that part of the plan cue infighting and rollout delay   since wimax launched over a year late and the competition jumped forward the wimax rollout was cut short verizon pushed up their lte rollout far earlier than planned which caused constant verizon data network outages last year at&amp;t secured dominance with the iphone and their network allowed them to have higher data speeds so they were n't worried about speeding up their lte rollout t mo 's parent company wanted out of the us market but still had high speed and low prices sprint had to move forward with lte or eat everyone else 's dust    that 's why you never got it   to top that off they had to their 800 mhz spectrum which meant killing the ability for them to use it for a few years they also needed to completely rebuild their public image which was shit thanks to 's predecessor gary and his crew all of which got shit canned when took charge they also had to deal with a few somewhat bad calls like the purchase orchestrated by and his crew the good news is that they that 800 mhz spectrum from the deal which was fairly important   here 's the good news sprint 's network overhaul is going to be awesome   the 2.5 spectrum is excellent for data speeds and high traffic densely populated areas will see some amazing speeds where the 2.5 spectrum falls off the 1900 mhz will pick up where 1900 mhz falls off the 800 mhz will pick up everything will deliver a nice smooth and fast experience you 'll start enjoying these improvements within 6 months   i 'm pretty hopeful that softbank will bring back and for between the us and japanese networks

none of that is filtered my way as a part owner sure it is it 's just not always obvious when a company makes money it either other then the fourth option the first three all increase the total value of the company   if you owned 1 of a company that was worth x and is now worth x+1 the value of that 1 ownership should go up as well one model of the value of a share of stock is the present value of all future cash flows that the company produces for its shareholders which would be either through dividends earnings provided that they are invested back into the company or through liquidation sale   so as earnings increase or more accurately as projected future earnings increase so does the value of a share of the company also note that the payment of dividends causes the price of a stock to go down when the dividend is paid since that 's equity cash that 's leaving the company reducing the value of the company by an equivalent amount of course there 's also something to be said for the behavioral aspect of investing meaning that people sometimes invest in companies that they like and sell stock of companies that they do n't like or disagree with e.g. 's

a mortgage backed security or mbs is the security   it 's not an entity it 's essentially a contract   as an investment they function more or less the same way a bond does there is nothing wrong with the concept behind a mortgage backed security   functionally securities like these allows banks and other institutions to lend to high risk borrowers   you package small slices of a wide range of risk from a large number of mortgages and the investor receive something similar to the average of the rates being charged   essentially from a big pool of mortgages of varying risk you will create a different big pool of bonds that can be sold to investors based on some sort of expected return   for a frame of reference on a much smaller scale look at peer to peer lending sites like lendingclub and prosper   the idea is lots of people of varying risk profiles make requests for loans of varying amounts   you bring your $ 2,500 and invest $ 25 in to 100 different loans   this way even if a few default you will still eek out a profit   it also allows you to include riskier borrowers without materially impacting your expected return

as i 'm sure you are reading in hull 's classic the basic valuation of bonds depends on the chance of entity defaulting on those bonds   let 's start with just looking at the us   the united states has a big advantage over corporations in issuing debt as it also prints the same currency that the debt is denominated in   this makes it much easier not to default on your debt as you can always print more money to pay it   printing too much currency would cause inflation lowering the value of debt but this would also lower the value of us corporate debt as well   so you can think of even the highest rated corporate bonds as having the same rate as government debt plus a little extra due to the additional default risk of the corporation the situation with other aa rated governments is more complicated   most of those governments have debt denominated in their local currency as well so it may seem like they should all have similar rates   however some governments have higher and some actually have lower rates than the united states   now as above some of the difference is due to the possible need of printing too much currency to cover the debt in crisis and now that we have more than one country to invest in the extra risk of international money flowing out of the country 's bonds however the bigger difference between aa governments rates depends more on money flow central banks and regulation   bonds are still mostly freely traded instruments that respond to supply and demand but this supply and demand is heavily influenced by governments   central banks buy up large portions of the debt raising demand and lowering rates   regulators force banks to hold a certain amount of treasuries perhaps inflating demand finally to answer your question the united states has some interesting advantages partially just due to its long history of stability controlled inflation and large economy making treasuries valuable as one of the lowest risk investments   so its rates are generally on the low end but government manipulation can still mean that it is not necessarily the lowest

you must understand that not everyone has or can get credit cards consider that those who are in the the lowest 20 30 of income tend to have fewer credit cards or none and lower credit debt although some have quite high credit card debt relative to their income   so you really are n't comparing the same demographics the population of all income earners used to calculate average income and the population of all credit card debt holders are not the same groups of people once you remove those folks from consideration then credit card usage may still average higher but accept that it is unusual for people making less than $ year to have much credit card debt you must understand that wealth and income are two very different although related concepts one must note that there are millions of people in the u.s. who have wealth they have net assets of over $ 1 m excluding their homes many of those folks have assets greatly exceeding $ 1m. and although it might seem foolish to carry a large balance on their credit cards they may have quite low interest rates and simply find it simpler and more convenient to use credit cards in lieu of personal loans   suppose you have $ 2 m in net assets and want to buy a classic car or a diamond necklace   charging $ 30 k and carrying the balance until a dividend check arrives may make sense understand also that not everyone makes the same choices or good choices carrying a credit card balance may appear like a poor choice especially when you are not wealthy or have lower income but suppose you have a high credit limit across several cards and you need to handle a short term financial challenge car repair layoff medical bills etc   you might use the credit card to pay for that purchase essentially financing an extraordinary event over a longer period of time   and although having a balance of more than 5 10 of your monthly income may seem foolish to some it may make sense to others and some people choose to carry balances of 50 to 100 of their credit limit   others realize that keeping their credit utilization below 30 20 or 10 of the credit limit is a better plan both interest rate and risk wise

i would strongly try to influence circumstances so that buying is feasible that means buy something where it is likely that you can resell it at the same price or even higher or at the least for significantly more than total cost of ownership rent payed elsewhere for example if it is in an area where you have good reasons to assume that prices will go up in the future or if the object needs and you are sure that you can do it yourself you will no doubt sell it later you will near certainly not live in such a small house for all time so the question of whether you will sell it is moot so when you have a potential house to buy you will have to calculate everything very carefully with an estimate of how long you will stay you need to make your calculation as optimistic pessimistic as you like this is more a question of your character whatever calculation comes out better wins it goes without saying that if you for example overestimating your ability or time to refurbish forgetting to calculate non obvious costs of being surprised by hidden damage to the object the price development in the area you run a considerable risk so the question of whether you are able to calculate the risks correctly will need to influence the calculation itself add 20 or whatever risk buffer if you are not sure etc but the potential is for you to have a very good start in the whole financial game of your life your house will likely be for a considerable time the biggest single part of costs in your life and getting that under control from the get go is a huge benefit

cfd providers typically offer cfds to investors using either the direct market access dma model or the market maker mm model direct market access the dma model gives you access to trade the underlying instrument on the relevant exchange from which the cfd is then derived all cfd transactions under the dma model have corresponding trades in the underlying instrument under the dma model providers typically charge their clients commission based on the notional contract value of the cfd market maker the mm model uses the price of the underlying instrument to derive the price of the cfd that is offered trading under the mm model does not necessarily mean that your cfd will be reflected by a corresponding trade in the underlying instrument under the mm model each cfd transaction creates a direct financial exposure for the provider which may or may not be hedged in the underlying instrument where the financial exposure is not hedged the market risk may increase for the market maker the mm model enables the provider to offer cfds against synthetic assets even if there is little liquidity in the underlying instrument which can result in a wider range of products on offer than with the dma model volatility and illiquidity in the underlying instrument can affect the pricing of mm cfds   the mm model can charge its clients commission based on the notional contract value or it can incorporate costs and fees in the dealing spread which represents the difference in price at which the issuer is prepared to buy and sell the cfd what do i use and why i have traded with both dma and mm models and prefer the mm the big advantage with mm is that they will provide a market even when the underlying is very illiquid and only might have a few trades each day   regarding the spread of the mm to the spread of the underlying i have found the mm to be practically in line with the underlying spread about 95 of the time the other 5 it may have been slightly wider than the spread of the underlying by usually 1c or 2c most mms aim to give you the best spread they can because they want to keep your business if they gave too wide a spread compared to the underlying it would n't be long before they had no customers

while from a money saving standpoint the obviously right course of action is to make only the minimum payment on the 0 loan there are potentially legal reasons to try to pay off a car loan early with a mortgage you are the legal owner of the property and any action by the lender beyond imposing fees e.g. foreclosure requires going through the proper legal channels on the other hand in most jurisdictions you are not the legal owner of a car purchased on a loan and a missed or even lost payment can result in repossession without the lender even having to go to court so from a risk aversion standpoint there 's something to be said for getting rid of car loans as soon as you can

respectfully i am of the opinion that you are mixing issues   paying a mortgage off early vs investing is a question that 's been well discussed at money se if you project a higher tax adjusted return on the investments than your current mortgage rate invest else pay the mortgage down   if the rent covers the mortgage you can maintain the investing it does n't matter for this discussion if the rent produces a profit so long as all expenses are covered   renting aside in the us now my mortgage is 3.5 2.6 after taxes so long as i expect a return well above this level long term i 'll stay investing and let the mortgage die its slow death another decade or so   i 'm sorry i can offer a formula it 's less about the same or more the mortgage is fixed right but the market return is unknown

inflation is an attempt to measure how much less money is worth it is a weighted average of some bundle of goods and services price 's increase   money 's value is in what you can exchange it for so higher prices means money is worth less monthly inflation is quoted either as a year ending on that month or since the previous month   as the values differ by more than a factor of 10 you can usually tell which one is being referred to when they say inflation in august was 0.4 a record high or inflation in august was 3.6   you do need some context of the state of the economy and how surprised the people talking about the numbers are   sometimes they refer to inflation since the last month and then annualize it which adds to the confusion consumer inflation 's value depends on what the basket of goods is and what you define as the same good   is a computer this year the same as the last   if the computer is 10x faster do you ignore that or factor it in what basket do you use   the typical monthly consumables purchased by a middle class citizen   by a poor citizen   by a rich citizen   a mixture and if so which mixture more detailed inflation figures can focus on inflation facing each of the population by household income split durable goods from non durable goods from services split wage from non wage inflation ignore volatile things like food and energy etc inflation does n't directly cause prices to raise instead it is a measure of how much raise in prices happened   it can easily be a self as inflation expectations can lead to everyone automatically increasing the price they charge for everything wages goods etc inflation can be viewed as a measurement of the cost of holding cash   at 10 inflation per year holding a million dollars in cash for a year costs you 100,000 $ in buying power   at 1 inflation it costs   at 0.1 inflation inflation of 10 in one year followed by 10 the next adds up to 1.1 1.1 1 = 21 inflation over the two years   for low inflation numbers this acts a lot like adding the further from 0 you get the more the lower order terms make the result larger   1 inflation for two years adds up to 10 over two years 21 100 over two years 300 1000 over two years 12000 etc   and yes some places suffer 1000 inflation

insert usual disclaimer that i 'm just a random guy on the internet not any kind of certified tax professional but once i withdraw the money how is that money taxable if i 'm understanding your situation correctly you want to look at the instructions for form 8889 under excess employer contributions it simply says if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return there does n't look to be any particular wording beyond that so i 'd just put it on form 1040 line 21 other income and label the line really specifically like excess employer contributions distributed from hsa also there is no mention of whether any fica taxes social security and medicare apply to these amounts you say that this was entirely contributed by the employer but even for cases where one contributes directly through payroll with an optional pre tax deduction this is usually implemented as a salary reduction agreement where the company is actually paying less money in salary and thus less showing up on the w-2 and just contributing to the hsa account instead it 's listed on the 8889 as an employer contribution even if in fact one sees it as a deduction on one 's pay stub in either case since the company did n't pay you the money as salary and merely contributed to the hsa instead i would n't expect any fica taxes to be owed on it the fact that the irs wants it listed under other income instead of wages also implies to me that it does n't count as salary that needs fica taxes presumably if people abused this in some way like getting their employer to deliberately over contribute each year and getting a refund in some sort of crazy scheme to try to reduce their ss taxes the government would get rather upset and probably call it some sort of tax evasion but for the amounts involved here particularly as you 're following the instructions listed i just would n't worry about it assuming that i withdraw excess contribution and report everything on form 8889 and form 1040 is there any further action required from my previous employer it 's your hsa so i would n't think so since the eligibility for hsas is based on what you do and not what they do you could for instance get covered by a different hdhp and they would n't be notified nor really care i do n't think they have anything more to do with it also i am not sure how to calculate amount of interest attributable to excess contribution i have only around $ 0.20 of total interest this year the bank holding the hsa could probably help with that as i 'd expect it to be a normal part of the excess contribution withdrawal process if not i 'd just make a reasonable effort based on the interest rate amount involved and number of days that the excess was in the account also keep in mind that in general when filing taxes anything under $ can round to $ 0 at some point one can only be as honest as the law allows

you should definitely be able to keep the us bank account and credit cards i 'm a uk citizen and resident who worked in the us for a few months on a temporary visa many years back and i still have the us bank account from that time unless you are planning on moving to the uk permanently you also should keep your us bank account and cards to make the process of moving back there eventually easier i would also suggest keeping moving at least a portion of your savings to the us at regular intervals to insure you against the risk that exchange rates will be against you when you move back it 'll also make things easier when you visit the us as you presumably will every so often if you use your us account and cards you wo n't get hit so badly by charges for making each individual payment

there is n't a single rate that works in both directions   there are two rates one for each direction   so if $ 1 = inr you may find that 100 inr = $    in fact it 's even worse than that   the rates are just the average values at which transactions occur   what happens in the real world is that someone presumably your bank in this instance offers to sell 100 inr for some amount perhaps $   other traders may either accept this price or refuse to trade   if they refuse to trade the bank may accept one of their offers perhaps $    anyway the answer to your question is that whomever does the actual conversion keeps the difference   of course they may then lose that money if the value falls before they sell   more either your bank or your friend 's bank could do the conversion itself   either or both could hold balances in various currencies so that they do n't have to rely on the of the exchange market   this is called a money market account and banks let their customers invest in them    it is a bit more likely to be your bank that gets the money than your friend 's bank   your friend 's bank does n't actually need to know that your account is in usd   they just transfer the amount in inr   it 's your bank that has to convert that into usd to deposit in your account

for most banks this is not the case   transfers within the bank are usually instantaneous it is not uncommon for banks to draw out the length of transactions because while the money is transferring or settling it is actually sitting on the bank 's balance sheet being lent out but not earning any interest   a good deal for them when you aggregate over the millions of customers they have   your bank may be trying to squeeze a few pennies of interest out of you delays in transactions also allow their fraud team the flexibility to investigate transactions if they want to normally they probably do n't but if the bank delays all transactions then those being investigated will not be aware of it

what a coincidence this was an exam question for my business law class   the main reason why individuals are not allowed to deduct expenses is because income tax revenue would be zero   the reason being if an individual is allowed to deduct expenses he she would spend 100 of their income and deduct it all on their tax returns which would mean he she would pay virtually no income tax this is bad for the gov't and the economy   it 's bad for the gov't because they loose tax revenue and it 's bad for the economy because people would not have any savings for tough times which can send the economy into a negative spiral

listing on nyse has more associated overhead costs than listing on nasdaq   in the case of young technology companies this makes nasdaq a more attractive option perhaps the most important factor is that nyse requires that a company has an independent compensation committee and an independent committee while nasdaq requires only that executive compensation and decisions are made by a majority of independent directors   no self respecting would be instant tech is going to want some independent committee it over their pay packet   additionally listing on nyse requires a company have stated guidance for corporate governance while nasdaq imposes no such requirement   similarly nyse requires a company have an internal audit team while nasdaq imposes no such requirement    fees on nyse are also a bit higher than nasdaq but the difference is not significant a good rundown of the pros cons

what could a small guy with $ 100 do to make himself not poor the first priority is an emergency fund one of the largest expenses of poor people are short term loans for emergencies being able to avoid those will likely be more lucrative than an s&p investment remember just like a loan if you use your emergency fund you 'll need to refill it be smart and pay yourself 10 interest when you do it 's still less than you 'd pay for a payday loan and yet it means that after every emergency you 're better prepared for the next event to get an idea for how much you 'd need you probably own a car how much would you spend if you suddenly had to replace it that should be money you have available if you think must buy a new car better have that much available if you can live with a you 're still going to need a few k.   having said that the next goal after the emergency fund should be savings for the infrequent large purchases the emergency fund if for the case where your car unexpectedly gets totaled the saving is for the regular replacement again the point here is to avoid an expensive loan   paying down a mortgage is not that important mortgage loans are cheaper than   car loans and much cheaper than payday loans still it would be nice if your house is paid when you retire but here chances are that stocks are a better investment than real estate even if it 's the real estate you live in

speculation is when someone else makes an investment you do n't like the above is tongue in cheek but is a serious answer there are several attempts at separating the two but they turn into moral judgements on the value of a pure buy and hold versus any other investment strategy which is itself doubtful is shorting an oil stock more speculation than buying and holding an alternative energy stock some economists take the other route and just argue that we should remove the moral judgement and celebrate speculation as we celebrate investment

i 'm really surprised at the answers here claims year per region is n't a statistic that is meaningful here you need to think about the risk factors and the purpose of the insurance first what does title insurance do it protects you against defects in the deed defects that may crop up and mean that your mortgage is no longer valid this is different from most forms of insurance the events that render your title invalid are events that may have happened years decades or even centuries ago a big part of the insurance policy and its cost is conducting research to assess the validity of a deed the whole point of the insurance is to reduce claims by improving data associated with the chain of custody of the property so how do you evaluate the risk of finding out about something that happened a long time ago that nobody appears to know about imo you have to think about risk factors that increase the probability that things were screwed up in the past you need to have an informed discussion with your attorney and figure out if it makes sense for you do n't dismiss it out of hand

you should probably talk to a professional tax adviser this does n't seem to be a common situation from the top of my head without being a lawyer or a tax professional i think of it like this the income is for year 200 and should have been taxed then you constructively received it then and not claimed it you probably had withholding from this salary that should have been reported to you then on w2 you can get a copy from the irs i 'd say you 're to amend the return for year 200 with the new income if it was n't reported then although if more than 3 years passed 6 if its 25 or more of your gross income for that year its beyond statute however as i said i 'm not a lawyer and not a professional tax adviser so you can not in any way rely on my opinion for anything that would result in not paying any taxes or penalties you should have you should talk to a licensed tax professional ea cpa lawyer licensed in your state

generally when you own something you can give it as a collateral for a secured loan that 's how car loans work and that 's how mortgages work your equity in the asset is the current fair value of the asset minus all your obligations secured by it so if you own a property free and clear you have 100 of its fair market value as your equity when you mortgage your property banks will usually use some percentage loan to value to ensure they 're not giving you more than your equity now or in a foreseeable future depending on the type and length of the loan the ltv percentage varies between 65 and 95 before the market crash in 2008 you could even get more than 100 ltv but not anymore for investment the ltv will typically be lower than for primary residence and the rates higher i do n't want to confuse you with down payments and deposits as it does n't matter unless you 're in australia apparently so as an example assume you have an apartment you rent out which you own free and clear lets assume its current fmv is $ 100k. you go to a bank and mortgage the apartment for a loan get a loan secured by that apartment at 65 ltv typical for condos for investment you got yourself $ 65 k to buy another unit free and clear you now have 2 apartments with fmv $ 165 k your equity $ 100 k and your liability $ mortgaging the new unit at the same 65 ltv will yield you another $ 42 k loan you may buy a third unit with this money your equity remains constant when you take the loan and invest it in the new purchase but the fmv of your assets grows as does the liability secured by them but while the mortgage has fixed interest rate usually not always the assets appreciate at different rates now lets be optimistic and assume for the sake of simplicity of the example that in 2 years your $ 100 k condo is worth $ 200k. voila you can take another $ 65 k loan on it the cycle goes on that 's how your grandfather did it

in the u.s. when you receive your credit card bill each month there 's a minimum payment amount that minimum payment is usually the greater of $ 25 or 1 of the new balance on the card plus new interest and fees as long as you pay the minimum payment amount you can pay as much as you want each month note in your example you would be required to pay more than $ 1000 to pay off the balance as interest would accrue each month on the unpaid principal how much more is dependent on the interest rate of the card

if one wants to have a bound on the loss percentages that are acceptable this is would be a way to enforce that for example suppose someone wants to have a 5 stop loss but does n't want this to be worse than 10 as if the stock goes down more than 10 then the sell should n't happen thus if the stock opened in a gap down 15 one day this triggers the stop loss and would exit at too low of a price as the gap was quite high as i wonder how familiar are you with how much a stock 's price could change that makes the prices not be as continuous as one would think at least this would be my thinking on a volatile stock where one may want to try to limit losses if the stock does fall within a specific range

this is more of a legal question than a monetary one you can try to negotiate with the debt owner as pete b. suggests alternatively you can ignore them and see what happens they might sue you for the 400 plus costs or maybe not that is a pretty small amount for a lawyer to show up in a court of law if you go to court you can win by that you returned the box and the charge is invalid if you testify in court that you did not return the box then you will lose sometimes a debt collector will just file a credit complaint against you and you would have to go to court to get that complaint removed from your record with the credit agency the loan owner has no idea whether you returned the box at all all they have is a debt security which simply says who owes the money and how much it is in a court room they have zero evidence against you unless you said something to them and they wrote it down or recorded it

learn something new every day i found this interesting and thought i 'd throw my 2c in good description i hope from short selling what is short selling first let 's describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock in purchasing stocks you buy a piece of ownership in the company you buy sell stock to gain sell ownership of a company when an investor goes long on an investment it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future conversely when an investor goes short he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller does n't own more specifically a short sale is the sale of a security that is n't owned by the seller but that is promised to be delivered   still with us here 's the skinny when you short sell a stock your broker will lend it to you the stock will come from the brokerage 's own inventory from another one of the firm 's customers or from another brokerage firm the shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account sooner or later you must close the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker if the price drops you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference if the price of the stock rises you have to buy it back at the higher price and you lose money so what happened the plan the reality lesson i never understood what shorting a stock meant until today seems a bit risky for my blood but i would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong this guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was in all visible aspects on the decline   how often does a large company or individual buy stock on the decline and send that stock soaring how often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours 600   another example is recently when bought 10 of weight watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours you would have the day you shorted that stock on that particular day if you believed enough to gamble on it going down in price

1 yes both of your scenarios would lead to earning $ 10 on the transaction at the strike date if you purchased both of them call it scenario 3 you would make $ 20 2 as to why this transaction may not be possible consider the following the call and put pricing you describe may not be available what you have actually created is called arbitrage 2 identical assets can be bought and sold at different prices leading to a zero risk gain for the investor in the real marketplace if an option to buy asset x in january cost $ 90 would an option to sell asset x in january provide $ 110   without adding additional complexity about the features of asset x or the features of the options buying a call option is the same as selling a put option well when selling a put option you do n't have the ability to choose whether the option is exercised meaning buying options has value that selling options does not but ignore that for a moment that means that you have arranged a marketplace where you would buy a call option for only $ 90 but the seller of that same option would somehow receive $ 110   for added clarity consider the following what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 200 then you could exercise your call option buying a share for $ 90 selling it for $ 200 making $ 110 profit you would not exercise your put option making your total profit $ 110 now consider what if in your example the future price ended up being $ 10 you would buy for $ 10 exercise your put option and sell for $ 110 making a profit of $ 100 you would not exercise your call option making your total profit $ 100 this highlights that if your initial assumptions existed you would earn money at least $ 20 and at most unlimited based on a skyrocketing price compared to your $ 90 put option regardless of the future price therefore such a scenario would not exist in the initial pricing of the options now perhaps there is an initial fee involved with the options where the buyer or seller pays extra money up front regardless of the future price that is a different scenario and gets into the actual nature of options where investors will arrange multiple simultaneous transactions in order to limit risk and retain reward within a certain band of future prices   as pointed out by r this fee would be very significant for a call option which had a price set below the current price typically options are sold out of the money initially which means that at the current share price at the time the option is purchased executing the option would lose you money if you purchase an in the money option the transaction cost initially would by higher than any apparent gain you might have by immediately executing the option for a more realistic options example assume that it costs $ 15 initially to buy either the call option or the put option in that case after buying both options as listed in your scenarios you would earn a profit if the share price exceeded $ 120 the $ 120 sale price less the $ 90 call option = $ 30 which is your total fee initially or dropped below $ 80 the $ 110 put price less the $ 80 purchase price = $ 30 this type of transaction implies that you expect the price to either swing up or swing down but not fall within the band between $ perhaps you might do this if there was an upcoming election or other known event which might be a failure or success and you think the market has not properly accounted for either scenario in advance i will leave further discussion on that topic arranging options of different prices to create specific bands of profitability loss to another answer or other questions which likely already exist on this site or in fact other resources because it gets more complicated after that point and is outside the root of your question
