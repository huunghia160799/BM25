you are not required to file a tax return in canada if you have no taxable income if you do not file a return you may be requested to by canada revenue agency and then you 'll need to file one there are hundreds of thousands of canadian residents who do not file tax returns the minister who the cra may assess any amount of taxes on any resident whether they file a return or not there are penalties for failing to file a return or filing late the penalties are based on a percentage of the taxes owed if you owe no taxes then the penalties are meaningless

if you took advantage of options like a home buyers plan hbp you definitely need to file since you must designate how much of the plan to repay   your employer does not know about what you do with your money so can not take this into account for the withheld taxes   if you do not report repayment of the hbp it will be treated as a withdrawal from your rrsp i.e. additional income for that tax year

as a canadian resident the simple answer to your question is yes having worked as a tax auditor and as a certified financial planner you are required to file an income tax return because you have taxable employment income all the employer is doing is deducting it at source and remitting it on your behalf that does not alleviate your need to file in fact if you do n't file you will be subject to a no filing penalty the one aspect you are missing is that taxpayers may be entitled to tax credits that may result in a refund to you depending on your personal situation e.g spousal or minor dependents i hope this helps

while you are required to do so as others have said it 's actually in your interest to do so in a recent article at tim discusses the benefits of filing tax returns for teens this situation may or may not apply to you but the message is the same the main benefits are 1 create rrsp contribution room and 2 be eligible for gst hst credits and other possible one shot credits think oil royalty surplus cheques in alberta excerpt you see when lincoln was 14 he filed a tax return and reported $ 2,000 of income that year he paid no tax thanks to the basic personal tax credit but he created $ 360 of rrsp contribution room that year beginning in 2003 lincoln started working part time in his father 's business his father agreed to pay him $ 6,000 each summer to work in the business to help save money for university lincoln did n't pay any tax on the money he earned in those summers because his basic personal tax credit was always higher than his earnings in addition lincoln added to his rrsp contribution room simply by filing a tax return each year

yes you have to file a tax return in canada   non residents that have earned employment income in canada are required to file a canadian personal income tax return usually your employer will have deducted sufficient taxes from your pay cheques resulting in a tax refund upon filing your canadian tax return you will also receive a tax credit on your us tax return for taxes paid in canada

personally i do n't think that the interest from the car loan is worth the credit history you 're building through it there are other ways to build credit that do n't require you to pay interest like the credit card you mentioned so long as you keep paying off the balance so i 'd go that route ditch the auto loan and replace it with a line of consumer credit just be careful not to overspend because the card will likely have a higher interest rate than your loan

roughly about 1 of 2 swiss francs is won abroad so yes it is easier for swiss companies to export when the swiss franc is not too high as it has been those last years the main export market for switzerland is the some companies are doing most or all of their business on the swiss market others are much more exposed to the the health of the global economy when the swiss franc appreciates some companies suffer a lot from that and other less it depends on their product portfolio competitors and other factors the last decades have shown that how the swiss franc valuation is less and less correlated with the performance of the swiss economy the swiss franc is used as a safe haven when the global economy goes bad or is uncertain in those times the swiss franc can be at least as compared to the purchasing power when the global economy is improving the over appreciation of the swiss franc tends to this is happening now in as a summary the swiss franc itself is not truly correlated with the competitiveness of the swiss economy but more about how people in the world are anxious in this regard it behaves a little bit like gold

there are people well companies who make money doing roughly what you describe but not exactly they 're called market makers their value for x% is somewhere on the scale of 1 that is to say a scale at which almost everything is volatile but they use leverage shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where it 's nothing like a simple as making a 1 profit every time they trade their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity the reason you ca n't do this is that you do n't have enough capital to do what market makers do and you do n't receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers at different prices hence the bid offer spread they have to be able to cover large short term losses on individual stocks but when the stock does n't move too much they do make profits from the spread the reason you ca n't just buy a lot of volatile stocks assuming i do n't make too many poor choices is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices so if you buy volatile stocks then you will buy a bunch of losers so what 's your strategy for ensuring there are n't too many supposing that you 're going to hold 10 stocks with 10 of your money in each what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them or maybe not all 10 but suppose 75 of your holdings give no impression that they 're going to hit your target any time soon do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your x% target in which case you start to look a little bit more like a long term investor after all or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by if you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades then you can not assess your strategy as if you always make an x% gain since that is n't true if you do n't ever sell at a loss then you 'll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers the big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists for how long and whether it 's in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing so sure if you used a short term time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today then it would be more profitable to day trade those than it would be to invest for the long term investing on the assumption that you 'll only pick short term winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine there are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market the simple strategy you describe is n't complete and can not be assessed since you do n't say how to decide what to buy but the selling strategy sell as soon as i 've made x% but not otherwise can certainly be improved if you 're keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data or current share price data run an imaginary account and see how you 're doing in 12 months when using historical data you have to be realistic about how you 'd choose what stocks to buy each day or else you 're just cheating at when using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months in which case you wo n't know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real you also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs you 'd be paying and the fact that you 're buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price you ca n't trade at the headline mid market price finally you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual you are in effect competing against a bank that 's on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade it has a and a team of kids and it 's trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are this is not to say the ca n't do well but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will so folks investing for their retirement generally prefer a low risk strategy that plays the averages and settles for taking long term trends

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

that oil is traded in usd makes for extra demand and thus a stronger dollar with more purchasing power it 's not really economics that are the issue though many might argue a weakened dollar might help the us economy cheaper exports   the real issue is power these gold backed securities make it so that certain countries can get around us sanctions   not to mention that controlling the currency that oil is traded in means the us can devalue their currency to gain an advantage in the event of a shortage   also because petroleum is traded in dollars this means treasury bonds are a natural place to store wealth for oil producers high demand for these bonds makes it cheap for the us government to borrow and easier to make interest payments thus making t bonds a safe asset

gt;not one of the components i listed did gm manufacture in the 1970s sure if you were to look today that list would be even greater including things like entire door entire instrument even entire engines but even in 1970 a huge amount of components were purchased rather than made   nor did i list the manufacturers of the boxes that ipads are packaged in nor the petroleum mining and refining that lead to the plastics used to mold the cases wrap the wires and the boxes   gt;i'm not sure that this wo n't happen if it does it 'll create a much different society as we suddenly ca n't afford all the crap that we 've become accustomed to i think it 's equally likely that the equities market and the huge profits created in the financial industry and tech industries along with the dollar being the world 's only reserve currency will prop up the dollar and give rise to the bipolar society of which i describe   highly doubtful   such extreme bipolar societies are very unstable

what i know about small companies and companies who are not listed on the stock markets is this if a small company has shares issued to different people either within an organization or outside the value of the shares is generally decided by the individual who wants to sell the share and the buyer who wants to buy it suppose my company issued 10 shares to you for your help in the organization now you need money and you want to sell it you can offer it at any price you want to to the buyer if the buyer accepts your offer that s the price you get so the price of the share is determined by the price a buyer is willing to buy it at from you remember the face value of the shares remains the same no matter what price you sell it for now annual profit distribution is again something called dividends suppose my company has 100 shares in total out of which i have given you 10 this means you are a 10 owner of the company and you will be entitled to 10 of the net profit the company makes now at the end of the year suppose my company makes a 12,000 usd net profit now a panel called board of directors which is appointed by share holders will decide on how much profit to keep within the company for future business and how much to distribute about share holders suppose they decide to keep 2000 and distribute 10,000 out of total profit since you own 10 shares of the company you get 1000 the softwares you are talking are accounting softwares you can do everything with those softwares after all a company is only about profit and loss statements

the biggest disadvantage to you is that your tenant now knows your bank information which means he can easily identify your source of money in the event he wins a lawsuit and wins a judgement   he will be able to have a court marshall freeze your account however if you deposit your tenant 's check into your account as opposed to an eft then your tenant can basically still obtain your bank account information and freeze your account it would just take him a bit longer to get that information i am definitely anti landlord in these situations because i 've had to deal with so many bad ones here in nyc but as a landlord the best thing you can do is to create a buffer account for you to deposit tenant rent money into then transfer the money from the buffer account to your regular account   this would prevent the tenant from knowing your personal bank information and greatly delay the tenant receiving his judgement from an assumed court win against you my source   i had to take my landlord to court and after obtaining a judgement i got a court marshall to begin the process of closing access to her account she could n't access the money in that account   the process resulted in her sending me a check assuming from her other account for the judgement since her account was frozen and she could n't access any of her money

if your net profit is $ 0 then no you will not owe income tax as a result of providing this service but there 's a lot more to consider than just that before you begin you 'll need to decide if this is a business or a hobby based on the fact that you do n't intend to make a profit you are probably going to be calling it a hobby for tax purposes regardless of whether it is a business or a hobby since you will be accepting payments from people you will need to report the income on your tax return as both a business and a hobby you can deduct all of your expenses to bring your profit down to $ 0 assuming all the expenses are legitimate business hobby expenses the main differences between business and hobby are if you choose to run as a business you 'll likely save quite a bit of money by avoiding the 2 rule and also by being able to deduct any non specific customer expenses and take a loss be careful though that you do n't go too many years with a business loss or the irs may re classify it as a hobby which may include an audit if you decide to run as a business you may need to charge a little more than just expenses to attempt to turn a profit or at least break even

she claimed that she makes money when you wanted to make some too she asked for your account credentials which are only needed to take money away never to give the simplest explanation would be loan scam even if you have only $ 10 on your account you can lose much more the trick is that someone using your credentials can take an online loan in your name and steal that money if the scheme is long running she 'll be taking new loans and using the money to pay back the earlier ones building up credit history for her victims only to allow taking even bigger loans her victims see the incoming transfers and are happy about the scheme working until she decides that the pot is big enough to cash it in and disappear leaving everyone deep in debt those who fell for this could be already defaulting loans they have no idea about and the loan companies have no way of notifying them because she redirected the contact details never reveal your password nobody needs your password for any legitimate purpose

a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

i do n't know about that particular program but more often than training foreign doctors are us medical schools are simply hiring doctors trained in foreign medical schools unlike most disciplines the ama controls the number of medical students admitted each year to medical colleges this keeps the supply of doctors down unlike say school or mba programs where there could be more supply than demand the lack of demand keeps the wages high for doctors but the alleged reason for restricting student numbers is higher quality as far as giving the limited seats to immigrants it does n't affect supply hiring foreign trained doctors who pass the does affect supply that is an example of using immigrant labor to increase worker supply and drive down wages

i 've been using ynab4 for the last few years and i like it so much that i have n't switched to the web version new ynab yet   however i have played around with the web version a little and here is what i have discovered despite the different look of the credit card account and the lengthy dissertation on the credit card differences in the transition guide credit cards are handled almost exactly the same in the new ynab as they were in ynab4 you enter credit card spending transactions in the same way as ynab4   when you enter a transaction money is pulled out of the budget category you select   the only difference is that in ynab4 this money was considered gone   now that money moves from your budget category into the new credit card category when it comes time to pay the credit card bill you also enter this transaction in the same way as before   it is entered as a transfer of money from your checking account to your credit card account   the only difference here is that with new ynab the funds are deducted from your credit card category   this is handled automatically so you do n't have to think about it if you do n't want to    if you always pay your credit card bill in full you never have to budget money manually into the credit card category   the money will already be there from when you entered the credit card spending transactions   the only time you would manually budget money into the credit card spending category is if you have old credit card debt that you are trying to pay off a quick example in pictures i start out with $ 10,000 in my checking account and no credit card debt   i 've got all $ 10,000 in my fun money category   now i spend $ 100 at the store   you can see that just like in ynab4 the credit card account is now in the red $ 100 and the checking account balance has not changed in the categories my fun money category is down $ 100 to $ 9,900 just like it would be in ynab4   the only difference is that there is now $ 100 in the new credit card payments category   when it is time to pay the bill i enter an account transfer just like in ynab4   note that the credit card balance is back to $ 0 and the checking account balance is now down to $ 9,900 the credit card payment budget category is now magically back to $ 0   the above example starts with a zero balance on the credit card   however most people will have a non zero balance on their credit card when they first start a budget   in ynab4 when you added a credit card with a negative balance the debt was shown in a budget category called pre ynab debt   you then added money to this budget category until it went to zero and then you did n't need this budget category anymore with new ynab credit card balances are not shown in budget categories   if you add a credit card account with a balance the debt is not shown in the budget categories   to pay off this debt you can fund the credit card payments category   after this existing balance amount is paid off you wo n't need to fund the credit card payments category anymore as long as you properly assign each new credit card purchase to a funded budget category

whole life in most instances is a very bad plan it 's marketed as a life insurance policy wrapped in an investment but it does neither very well the hidden caveat of whole life is that the investment goes away if you die   say for example i have a $ 100,000 whole life insurance policy and over the years i have paid in enough to have a $ 15,000 cash value on the policy if i die my family gets $ 100,000 and the cash value is lost with term life you can get a substantially higher amount of coverage for a smaller payment if you invest the difference you end up not only with better coverage but a better cash value from the difference if you do n't die which is what we all hope for anyways as said your insurance should be designed around replacing lost income value   you should get 10x your annual income in term life insurance

you know what lowers wages   social safety nets   before you read that as advocating for the removal of social safety nets hear me out   a low wage service company would in the absence of any social safety net be required to pay employees far more   why   because employees would be required to cover all of their needs with their wage   no food stamps medicaid etc     what then would higher wages do   it would cut back on the need to spend on social safety nets   higher wages provide employees with the ability to cover more of their own needs with their labor income     unfortunately this is a chicken or egg problem   i would never cut social safety netting before advocating for higher wages because i would n't leave people out in the cold without needed assistance   so where do i stand   i advocate for higher wages first so that we can gradually decrease taxpayer funded social safety nets for working americans later

one option might be to use tax certificates to save this money at the moment they do n't pay any interest unless you deposit more than £ 100,000 at once so they are n't very attractive from that point of view but they do give you a clean way to segregate your money and for the purposes of charging penalty interest hmrc will treat you as having made the payment at the time you purchased the certificate if it turns out that you should have paid the actual tax earlier than you did another option is a regular saver account these typically have limits of £ 250 per month so you might have to open a few given the amount you have to save that would add up to a lot of maintenance effort particularly as you 'd have to open new accounts again each year however they do typically offer good interest rates compared to what 's available elsewhere and the way they operate fits well with your needs money coming in regularly and then going out all at once

you do n't understand government financing at all   earn revenue aka taxes   they also spend money   the different between the money they spend and they money they earn is the deficit   if you run a deficit for a long period of time you incur a very large national debt   now you can finance aka pay for a deficit by borrowing money   this means you can sell bonds and instead of pay off the debt each year you just pay the interest   if your spending balloons out of control your the likely hood of you paying your debt decreases   if you are very unlikely to payback your debt people wo n't buy any more of your bonds and you no longer have the income from borrowing to pay off your interest from other debt you owe or what ever other obligations you own think mortgage payments or teachers salaries etc   here 's were europe and usa differ european nations ca n't just print money   they can issue more debt but they ca n't just create more euros   if you can print money you can pay off your debt with money you literally created out of thin air at the expense of your people this is called inflation   but this is a form of cheating eventually people wo n't trust you and wo n't buy your debt either   so where do the banks come in   if the government is sound and the banks are not the government can backstop the banks   this is what the us and uk did   greece spain ireland all had to back stop their banks also   however greece spain and and italy and portugal also have    1   a lot of debt   2   structurally high deficits   3   extremely high borrowing costs high interest rates because people do n't trust them because   4   weak underlying economies   the fourth point gets you in real trouble   if you have high entitlements lots of out of work who the hell is paying taxes and what are they going to   you have no revenue   remember a govt works just like a household   it is easy for a good household to support one member but it is difficult for a member to support an irresponsible household

what are the risks pertaining to timing on long term index    investments the risks are countless for any investment strategy   if you invest in us stocks and prices revert to the long term adjusted average you will lose a lot of money   if you invest in cash inflation may outpace interest rates and you will lose money   if you invest in gold the price might go down and you will lose money   it 's best to study history and make a reasonable decision i.e. invest in stocks here are long term returns by asset class computed by jeremy siegel   $ 1 invested in equities in equals $ today if was not invested and $ million if it was invested in stocks   this is the magic of compound interest and cash bonds have not been nearly as magical as stocks historically 2 how large are these risks the following chart shows the largest drawdowns decreases in the value of an asset since 1970 source   asset prices decrease in value frequently   financial assets are volatile but historically they have increased over time enabling investors to earn compounded returns exponential growth of money is how to get rich   i personally view drawdowns as an excellent time to buy it 's like going on a shopping spree when everything in the store is discounted 3 in case i feel not prepared to take these risks how can i avoid    them the optimal asset allocation depends on the ability to take risk and your tolerance for risk   you are young and have a long investment horizon so if stocks go down you will have plenty of time to wait for them to go back up if you 're smart you 'll buy more stocks when they go down because they 're cheap so your ability to bear risk is high   from your description it seems like you have a low risk tolerance despite a high ability to be exposed to risk   here 's the return of various asset classes and how the average investor has fared over the last 20 years source   get educated read common sense on mutual funds a random walk down wall street etc and do n't be average closing words investing in a globally diversified portfolio with a dollar cost averaging strategy is the best strategy for most investors   for investors that are unable to stay rational when markets are volatile i.e. the investor sells their stocks when stocks decrease 20 a more conservative asset allocation is recommended   due to the nature of compounded interest a conservative portfolio is likely to have a much lower future value

the interest rate is determined by your 401(k provider and your plan document   of course you may be able to influence this depending on your relationship with the provider   i 'm very certain that is not the only rate that is possible   however your provider is constrained by irc which states that the loan must be made at a reasonable rate of interest    the definition of reasonable rate of interest would probably need to go to court and i do not know if it has   the irs probably has internal guidelines that determine who gets thrown to the dogs but they would not make those public because it takes away their discretion   because of the threat of getting by the irs i think you will have a hard time getting a provider to allow super high or super low interest rate loans note i am not a lawyer

how do treasury auctions work first the us government will issue a notice indicating how much money it would like to borrow below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise $ 23 billion   the announcement indicates the date of the auction march 8th 2011 in the example as well as deadlines for competitive am and noncompetitive am bids if you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times competitive bid the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security all treasuries are priced in $ 100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner $ 100 when the security matures $ 100 is the face or par value noncompetitive bid the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement these bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction there is a limit of $ 5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction for competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35 of the total offering in order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let 's go back to the example the table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the $ 23 billion being issued the bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a $ 100 par value note bid 1 $ 5 billion max price do n't care bid 2 $ 10 billion max price do n't care bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 notice there is a total of $ 40 billion in bids the auction is only for $ 23 billion this means some bids will go unfilled the ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid to cover ration for our example it is $ a high bid to cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders a low ratio indicates weak demand a ratio under 2.0 is considered weak the bids are filled in the following manner results of our example auction bid 1 $ 5 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 2 $ 10 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 10 billion filled at $ 95 bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 only $ 3 billion filled at $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 not filled bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 not filled once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction below is the actual results of the auction   there are some additional items that are reported from the auction high rate this is the highest yield or the lowest price that was accepted at the auction for our example this would be $ 95 allotted at high this is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield or lowest accepted price for our example the last $ 3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be $ = 13 price price as determined by the auction median rate half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above low rate the lowest yield or highest price submitted for the competitive bids the announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories there is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as this stands for system open market account this represents treasuries that are held by the federal reserve if the federal reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries for our example auction the fed had no bills maturing at the time if they did then the fed would also get the same price determined at the auction here is an article i wrote with a little more detail on the auction process   i 've included my sources at the end of the article as for treasuries being a safe investment   i 'm not so sure   right now the yield on 10 years is around 2.5   who in their right mind would lend money to the government for 10 years at 2.5   not me

it 's not so much a credit card but a financial institution 's online platform that either provides this functionality or not the following canadian financial institutions show an itemized list of pre authorized transactions not an exhaustive list   the following institutions show a total value of pre authorized transactions most other institutions show the available credit e.g. chase financial used by amazon rewards which give an indication of how much you have to spend by subtracting the current balance and the available balance from the total credit limit you can get an indication of the total amount of pre authorized transactions example $ 1000 $ 500 $ 400 = $ 100 is the amount of pre authorized transactions from td 's demo it appears that they do n't include pre authorized transactions in the available credit you can verify for yourself by logging in to online banking after you make a purchase and comparing the available credit to credit limit current balance if it is equal then they do n't include if it is different most likely for the value of the transaction then they do

people are downvoting you but the reality is that a cushion is n't a bad idea   not a perpetual thing but until the op gets set up with a job place to live etc   they know the job is going to work out etc they might want to have some cash as they are likely not going to forgo eating etc that said i would treat it as money to be used in place of a credit card with the high rates etc    again i am not saying spend the money i am being realistic that it takes money to secure an apt and unless you can borrow cheaper than 6 elsewhere i know i could probably get unsecured money cheaper than that where i live but i do n't know the ops situation   i would n't invest it given the situation personally   if you have a great job it wo n't matter you will build up past 1200 soon and can then start to invest a portion of that cash   if you do n't then you should n't be risking debt money especially if your level of sophistication in the market has you here asking the question   that 6 savings is tax free as well so you need to gross it up based on your tax situation   also make note of any currency conversions that would need to happen so depending on what you want to invest in currency risk could be a real concern as well   one other reason i think getting down at least a portion of the debt could be good is simplification   ca n't spend money you do n't view yourself as having   some people might be more disciplined to reign in spending when they see a lower number in their account   i 'm personally not one of those people but again i would likely kill the debt off now just to have one less thing on my mind but only as soon as i am stable know where i am going to live have enough to eat and relatively sure that will continue in the future

wow i 'm one of the two people who actually respond to your half baked idea and you jump down my throat    the example of changing majors is different because you 're talking about a share of lifetime income not a loan that will be paid off in the next 10 15 years with such a long term obligation as you mention the onus to get it right on your first major will be high possibly   as for probably have some penalty that 's what i 'm talking about you have n't even really considered the depth necessary to create a system such a vast and liquid system so you do n't really have any idea how massive the costs could be in comparison to such miniscule amounts of principal   and do n't flatter yourself i 'm not confusing your little five minute thought with the brothers impressive novel i mentioned it because it 's a valid parallel and while you may not be talking about corporations you are talking about creating securitized investments aka securities stocks on a massive scale   you 're talking about millions of individuals who need to be for risk and profitability who need to be verified double checked maybe interviewed bundled and approved by very nature of being securities they 'll need approval from people like the sec as well as listings on exchanges or somewhere all of this conforming comes with a great deal of fees by the time you 're done we 're at a similar complexity level to that of a corporation   i 'm sorry you felt the need to because you seem to be out of your league on this one next time maybe explaining your point in greater detail will help people understand what you 're saying

it may be the case that some of your debts have a flat regular fee in addition to the interest which will go away when the debt is completely paid for example my mortgage has an approximately $ package fee as well as its quite low interest when i finish paying the mortgage i wo n't have to pay that fee anymore so it is theoretically possible that spending extra money on paying off my mortgage would be better than spending it on paying off some other debt i think it 's unlikely that it would actually ever be my optimal move in practice but the point is there may be an advantage financial or otherwise to getting rid of a particular debt other than merely removing the burden of interest those are special situations though and in the majority of cases starting with the highest interest loan will be the right move

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

i think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person it is not the price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at if apple last traded at $ 100/share then apple shares are worth $ 100 if good news about apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money and the most recent trade becomes $ 105 then that is now what apple shares are worth remember that generally speaking the company itself does not sell you its shares instead some other investor sells you shares they already own when a company sells you shares it is called a public offering to get to your actual question saying something is priced in implies that the market that is investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something for example if you open up your newspaper and read an article about ibm inventing a new type of computer chip you might want to invest in ibm but the rest of the market has also heard the news so everyone else has already traded ibm assuming that this new chip would be made that means when you buy even if sales later go up because of the new chip those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at one principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency generally if there were perfect market efficiency then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price in such a scenario the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort it would mean that everyone 's collective best guess about what will happen to the company has been priced in to the most recent share trade

on expiry with the underlying share price at $ 46 we have you ask   how come they 600 100 why because you have sold the $ 45 call to open you position you must now buy it back to close your position   this will cost you $ 100 so you are debited for $ 100 and this debit is being represented as a negative subtracted i.e. because you have purchased the $ 40 call to open your position you must now sell it to close your position   upon selling this option you will receive $ 600 so you are credited with $ 600 and this credit is represented as a positive added i.e. + $ 600 therefore upon settlement closing your position will get you $ = $ 500   this is the first point you are questioning    however you should also note that this is the value of the spread at settlement and it does not include the costs of opening the spread position which are given as $ 200 so you net profit is $ = $ 300 you then comment   i know i am selling 45 call that means as a writer i want stock price to go down or stay at strike as a buyer i want stock price to go up here note that for every penny that the underlying share price rises above $ 45 the money you will pay to buy back your short $ 45 call option will be offset by the money you will receive by selling the long $ 40 call option   your $ 40 call option is covering the losses on your short $ 45 call option no matter how high the underlying price settles above $ 45 you will receive the same $ 500 net credit on settlement   for example if the underlying price settles at $ 50 then you will receive a credit of $ 1000 for selling your $ 40 call but you will incur a debit of $ 500 against for buying back your short $ 45 call   the net being $ 500 = $   this point is made in response to your comments posted under dr. jones answer

you have several options depending on your tolerance for risk certainly open an investment account with your bank or through any of the popular discount brokerage services then take however much money you 're willing to invest and start earning some returns you can split up the money into various investments too a typical default strategy is to take any money you wo n't need for the long term and put it in an index fund like the s&p 500 or a european equivalent yes it could go down especially in the short term but you can sell shares at any time so you 're only 2 3 days away at any time from liquidity historically this money will generate a positive return in the long run for smaller time frames a short term bond fund often gives a slightly better return than a money market account and some people like me use short term bond funds as if it were a money market account there is a very low but real risk of having the fund lose value so you could take a certain percentage of your money and keep it close in a bond fund likewise you can sell shares at any time win or lose and have the cash available within a couple days

the technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative gdp growth as is the natural cycle the curve will at some point in the future maybe it 's tomorrow or 5 years from now but nobody knows for certain one also should n't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators for example there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the ted spread and the libor spread if you take a peek at the ted spread it tells a much different story the ted spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other a lower ted rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower which would be another bank   lastly you really ca n't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling even if we are on the of a recession here in the us nobody can tell the impact and depth of the recession in my opinion we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1 3 years outside of that your guess is as good as mine

in principle the us taxes both income and gifts simply thinking good thoughts is not necessarily sufficient to avoid filing or payment obligations giving somebody money with no repayment date no interest and no enforceable note looks an awful lot like either income or a gift a loan normally has interest money sitting in a savings account is insured and other investments generally have an expected return   why would somebody give a loan with no interest with only flexible or informal payment expectations in a way where it has neither deposit insurance nor any expectation of net returns   that looks a lot like a gift at the very least a gift of the time value and the default risk the irs definitely polices loan rates the latest release is revenue ruling 2014 13 the is useful for tax concepts such as original issue discount when issuers sell low interest or no interest bonds or loans at less than face value attempting to recharacterize interest income as return of principal various grantor trusts e.g. and so forth   it 's a simple way for the irs to link to market rates of interest documentation and sufficient interest as well as clear payment schedule and maybe call or demand rights make it a bona fide loan   there is no real way for the irs to distinguish between an informal arrangement and a post hoc lie to conceal a gift   moreover an undocumented loan is generally difficult to enforce so it looks less like a true loan the lender declares the interest payments as income on his form 1040 line and if necessary schedule b.

yes of course it is car dealers are motivated to write loans even more than selling cars at times when i bought a new car for the first time in my life in my 40 's it took longer to get the finance guy out of my face than to negotiate and buy the car   the car dealer selling you the used car would be happy to package the financing into the selling price similar to how points are used to adjust the actual cost of a mortgage the dealer can tinker with the price up front knowing that you want to stretch the payment out a bit   to littleadv 's point 3 months is n't long i think a used car dealer wold be happy to work with you

they are not required to fulfill the trade that they have intended to execute   they are able to cancel or modify the trade at any point   example this is how insiders are able to manipulate the price of shares through there buying and selling intentions   a ceo would be able to disclose a buy order for a month from now or whatever time period is required   this would most likely increase the price of the stock as investors would see this as a good sign of company performance   up until the point when the buy order is scheduled to execute the ceo can then cancel the order and create a new sell order   since the stock is high in price his new order is likely to make him money based on the manipulation from his trading intentions    i am not an expert on the subject and only know as much as i do through personal research here is an interesting article about this kind of insider trading and manipulation fine line between legal and illegal insider

anytime the government gets into subsidizing something it becomes more expensive   this happened with housing in the when they deemed all americans need to own a house medicine when they started medicare medicaid in the 1960s and education which iirc they started with the gi bill at the tail end of ww2 and student loans shortly thereafter   credit allows people to spend money they do n't have now causing what prices these systems can charge to rise and encourages servicing the loan later in life   add to that the accreditation system and education becomes the expensive to many jobs that worked on an apprenticeship system before pay you a token wage learning the trade and maybe room and board in some cases   the middle classes have been getting the last decades and it shows from the country going from 1 households with luxury time to 2 households with unpaid overtime in many cases to afford the same or lower standard of living

when you have multiple assets available and a risk free asset cash or borrowing you will always end up them if you have a reasonable objective function   however you seem to have constrained yourself to 100 investment   combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio   the fact that you describe the us fund as dominating the fund indicates that this may be the case for you   ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset dominates another but it may not in your special case notice that these funds are both already highly diversified so all you are getting is cross border diversification by getting more than one   that may be why you are getting the solution you are   i 've seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy with some reliable results   fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones   however getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible   unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs   for that reason most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition but seldom do the math for our own portfolio   in any model you use your weak link is the expected return and covariance   more sophisticated models do n't usually help produce a more reasonable result for that reason your original strategy 80 20 sounds pretty good to me   not sure why you are not diversifying outside of equities but i suppose you have your reasons

there are many situations where injecting a certain amount of cash at the right time may reap rewards far in excess of the value of the cash injected for example if someone who needs a car to get to work gets in a wreck and that person does not have ready money to make it may have no choice but to secure very expensive financing   receipt of $ 1000 in ready money to repair the car may thus save the person from having to take out a loan that would cost $ 1200 or more to repay while the insurance business has sufficient overhead that it is unlikely that insurance would generally have a positive net expectation even considering such factors it is at least theoretically possible that insurance could have a positive expected value for both the insurer and the insured and in some cases it may have positive expected values for both parties in practice as well

you should not look at volume in isolation but look at it together with other indicators and/or the release of news good or bad when there is lower than average volume this could be an indication that the stock is in a bit of a holding pattern possibly waiting for some company or economic news to come out especially when accompanied by small changes in price it could also mean that trading in a certain direction is drying up and the trend is about to end this could be accompanied with a large move in price when there is higher than average volume 2 to 3 times more or higher this could be due to the release of company results company or economic news or the start or end of a trend especially if accompanied by a gap a large increase in volume accompanied by a large fall in price usually a gap down may also be an indication the stock has gone ex dividend there could be a range of reasons for variations in volume to the average volume that is why you need to look at other indicators company reporting and news and economic news in combination with the volume changes to get a grasp of what is really happening

the key thing to consider in a question like this is what return am i getting on my investment versus what interest am i paying on the loan if the investment returns more than what you 're paying on the loan than it makes sense to keep the investment and pay off the loan with other income if the investment returns less than it makes sense to cash it out to pay off the loan one complicating factor is taxes in the case of an ira you 're not paying taxes on the profits you do pay a tax penalty for an early withdrawal those are both factors that tend to make keeping the money in the ira more desirable and of course if the choice is between keeping your investment and defaulting on the loan you probably want to close out the investment i do n't know what return you 're getting on your ira but it 's probably more than 6.8 i 'd have to check but i think my retirement funds got over 20 last year if you 're not getting 6.8 you might want to investigate switching to another investment fund i 'm sure there 's a lot i do n't know about your situation but i 'd think that keeping the ira would be a better plan if you ca n't add to it for some time well you get these debts paid off well that 's how it is

anything related to the central bank will have a large impact as they are the ones who determine interest rates and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows   gdp is also important as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity the opposite is also true large increases in gdp may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed inflation data is also very important again large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates this data typically is in the form of cpi note that each central bank is different they all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on the federal reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data especially wage inflation data and employment significant deviations in these data points from what s expected by investors can greatly move the market however these specific factors are a little less important for say mexico which is mostly concerned with headline inflation read the statements issued by the central banks to find out what s important to them central banks also issue expectations for things like growth cpi etc if these expectations are not met it may result in a policy change or at least talk of a policy change at the next meeting of the central bank anticipating these policy changes and trading accordingly is one strategy to be a profitable forex trader also there are several forex news calendars online that indicate what is likely to be high impact news these can be helpful starting out

first paragraph is very true but you also have to take into consideration that the adviser and the company are 2 different things to look into for the adviser quickest and easiest way is to do a facebook search the point of this is to see how transparent they are with their personal life even companies are now relying on facebook to see how they really are i would n't care if the person has lots of photos with booze and girls but i would be concerned if they are using fb for spamming purposes have pictures with drugs or hints that they do n't like their job and want to move on to something else   second paragraph is spot on as well but i would rather want to know if the company cold calls or not which leads in to your last statement   for one adviser more than 100 clients is a red flag this could mean that they push savings plans left and right they do n't contact their current clients and/or they may not have the ability to assist clients should they get many queries   a few good questions to ask   1 how do you make your salary   2 besides this plan you are selling me what other types of products do you work with and show me several examples   3 how many other advisers are in your firm   4 how many clients does your colleagues and boss have   5 how often do you cold call   6 who else cold calls in your office   7 how does your company get new clients other than referrals    go style and ask the above questions several times using different phrases

as i understand it a company raises money by sharing parts of it ownership to people who buy stocks from it   it 's not ownership in quotes it 's ownership in a non ironic way   you own part of the company   if the company has 100 million shares outstanding you own of it per share it 's small but you 're an owner   in most cases you also get to vote on company issues as a shareholder though non voting shares are becoming a thing   after the initial share offer you 're not buying your shares from the company you 're buying your shares from an owner of the company   the company does n't control the price of the shares or the shares themselves i get that some stocks pay dividends and that as these change the price of the stock may change accordingly the company pays a dividend not the stock   the company is distributing earnings to it 's owners your proportion of the earnings are equal to your proportion of ownership   if you own a single share in the company referenced above you would get $ 1 in the case of a $ 100,000,000 dividend of the dividend for your ownership stake i do n't get why the price otherwise goes up or down why demand changes with earnings and speculation on earnings   companies are generally valued based on what they will be worth in the future    what do the prospects look like for this industry   a company that only makes typewriters probably became less valuable as computers became more   was a new law just passed that would hurt our ability to operate   did a new competitor enter the industry to force us to change prices in order to stay competitive   if we have to charge less for our product it stands to reason our earnings in the future will be similarly reduced    so what if the company 's making more money now than it did when i bought the share presumably the company would then be more valuable none of that is filtered my way as a part owner   yes it is as a dividend or in the case of a company not paying a dividend you 're rewarded by an appreciating value why should the value of the shares change a multitude of reasons generally revolving around the company 's ability to profit in the future

that 's a broad question but i can throw some thoughts at you from personal experience   i 'm actually an australian who has worked in a couple of companies but across multiple countries and i 've found out first hand that you have a wealth of opportunities that other people do n't have but you also have a lot of problems that other people wo n't have first up asset classes real estate is a popular asset class but unless you plan on being in each of these countries for a minimum of one to two years it would be seriously risky to invest in rental residential or commercial real estate this is because it takes a long time to figure out each country 's particular set of laws around real estate plus it will take a long time to get credit from the local bank institutions and to understand the local markets well enough to select a good location this leaves you with the classics of stocks and bonds you can buy stocks and bonds in any country typically so you could have some stocks in a german company a bond fund in france and maybe a mutual fund in japan this makes for interesting diversification so if one country tanks you can potentially be hedged in another you also get to both benefit and be punished by foreign exchange movements you might have made a killing on that stock you bought in tokyo but it turns out the yen just fell by 15 and to top this off you are almost certainly going to end up filling out tax returns in each country you have made money in this can get horribly complicated very quickly as a person who has been dealing with the us tax system i can tell you that this is painful and the us in particular tries to get a cut of your worldwide income that said keep in mind each country has different tax rates so you could potentially benefit from that as well my advice choose one country you suspect you 'll spend most of your life in and keep most of your assets there make a few purchases in other places but minimize it ultimately most ex move back to their country of origin as friends family and shared culture bring them home

while i agree with the overarching narrative regarding the car industry self driving cars and how people will use transportation in the future i deeply disagree with his timeframe and reject that his clearly large city centric thinking will effect all parts of the country and all parts of the world    there is no way this happens as quickly as he says it will for the following reasons    on his claim that electric cars will be all anyone will buy 1 we lack the road or electrical grid infrastructure to support tens of millions of electric vehicles throughout the us this will take far more than just 5 10 years especially in the more rural parts of the country   2 we lack the production capacity to create the batteries for 17 million of yearly sales of automobiles for the few years between 2021 2025 when everyone is presumably just buying only electric self driving cars   3 the used market for combustion engine cars will tank so strongly that it will actually create demand for people to buy combustion cars as the costs will now outweigh the savings of buying a new car with lower running costs thus pushing his timeline out into the future by several years   4 cars even electric cars are much more complicated durable expensive and prone to damage and accidents than most software and disposable consumer electronics he cites in his examples of course nokia went from 50 of the market to 5 over one product cycle people completely replaced their phones every 2 3 years back then wireless carriers built a system where even if your phone worked you had little to no reason not to lock in another contract and get the next best phone of course people would dump their nokia bricks for an iphone it was the next best thing cars have a much longer life cycle and inefficient older models will be around for decades in some cases because they will be a sunk cost for those who bought them    on his claim that no one will own a car anymore and everyone will ride share   1 how does one decide to take a road trip somewhere what about people who travel for a living or as an integral part of doing their job   2 i personally think a ride sharing transportation network represents a limiting of freedom though i can see why people might make the opposite point people identify with owning their own cars keeping their own belongings in them having them for use whenever they so need or desire people who do n't live in dense urban i.e a huge group of americans and especially a huge group of americans who are older have money and are set in their ways are n't going to see this as nearly as attractive as someone who lives in new york or san might and those people hardly buy cars anyway   3 people are fucking stubborn it 's going to take a lot for people to decide to change up such an integral part of their daily lives this will not happen over a 3 4 year cycle   4 where is the infrastructure to park charge and perform maintenance on all these autonomous vehicles we will need more cars available during rush hour than at 3 pm or 3 am for that matter where do the cars go then   5 this simply wo n't work quickly in countries outside the very top of the first world they wo n't have the infrastructure or capital to invest to bring it up to speed fast enough to derail oil demand as quickly as he claims   5 this theory implies a central government that is in complete control to implement rules in support of autonomous cars i believe most of this will be done at the state and municipality level at first with some cities hopping on board and others banning the practice   6 this theory also implies that the technology will be flawless the first completely computer aided pedestrian disaster or multi car pile up will undoubtedly cause massive backlash regardless of the statistics showing general reduction in accidents and might clog this entire concept up in bureaucracy for decades as the government forces stricter and stricter safety and quality requirements on the software    i 'm not saying his view is n't the long run eventually for mobility in the us and the world in general but applying personal electronic technology cycle rules to large scale durable goods that work in real space instead of cyber space represents a whole different set of challenges and could easily take 25 50 years to really pull off over that time oil markets will right size themselves and the automotive manufacturers will consolidate and cater their product to meet demand service the fleet    tl dr this will take much longer to accomplish than he infrastructure takes time to build cars are a different technology than consumer electronics people are stubborn

no   mark to market valuation relies on using a competitive market of public traders to determine the share price from free market trading among independent traders who are not also insiders    any professional valuation would see through the promotional nature of the share offer it is pretty obvious that the purchaser of a share could not turn around and sell their share for $ 10 unless the free hosting that is worth most of the $ 10 follows it and that 's more of hybrid of stock and bond than pure stock   it is also pretty obvious that selling a few shares for $ 10 does not mean one could sell 10,000,000 shares for $ 10 because of the well known decreasing marginal value effect from economics while this question seems hypothetical as a practical matter offering to sell share of unregistered securities in a startup for $ 10 to the general public   is likely to run afoul of state or federal securities laws of the honesty of the business or any included promotional offers    see for more information about the sec regulations for raising capital for small businesses

do n't be afraid to shop around every couple of years when it 's time to renew my auto insurance i call a couple of places to see if i can get a better deal it 's especially important to do this as you get older because your rates go down assuming you keep a clean driving record also as your life changes e.g. if you get married move buy a home get a new car etc at 30 my rates dropped a lot when i bought a home i qualified for a discount by combining my home and auto insurance through the same carrier my suggestion would be to call 3 insurance companies for quotes all on the same day you 'll need to be able to identify the car you 'll be insuring for the most accurate quote do you belong to any organizations that offer insurance discounts e.g. my college alumni association had a program with one of the larger carriers that had the best rates on that i could find

look as my final comment   you 're overthinking this   companies routinely have more cash on their books than they need because they keep a rainy day fund   yes there are extreme examples like apple that has about 60 billion more than they need but practically all companies are going to maintain excess cash for emergencies acquisitions etc   as i said in another comment the common theme between a dcf and an ev multiple is that they are both capital structure independent     even here there are going to be differences companies with a really shitty capital structure read too much debt will trade publicly at a lower enterprise value multiple because of the risk that they go bankrupt   in an acquisition this probably would not be the case   in the case of a dcf you would probably raise your discount rate to account for the risk of bankruptcy

you seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up you are calling this day trading day trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day while it appears that the coo has performed a buy and a sell on the same day most people would consider this a single trade in reality it seems that the coo had stock options a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price at some point in the future provided as part of his compensation package he decided or was required to exercise those options today this means he bought the shares using his special option price it is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options to sell all of the resulting stock immediately this is very different from usual day trading which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price and then sold it later at a high price you are calling this insider trading that term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior in general stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised for example most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them this gives the employee incentive to stay longer and for a high level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance it gives incentive to do well technically you are correct this is likely considered an insider trade but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today it could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise as to your final question no these profits are the coo 's to do with as he likes

you asked specifically about the roth ira option and stated you want to get the most bang for your buck in retirement   while others have pointed out the benefits of a tax deduction due to using a traditional ira instead i have n't seen anyone point out some of the other differences between roth and traditional such as i agree with your thoughts on using an ira once you maximize the company match into a 401k plan    my reasoning is i personally prefer etfs over mutual funds for the ability to get in and out with limit stop or oco orders at open or anytime mid day if needed   however the price for that flexibility is that you risk discounts to nav for etfs that you would n't have with the equivalent mutual fund   said another way you may find yourself selling your etf for less than the holdings are actually worth   personally i value the ability to exit positions at the time of my choosing more highly than the impact of tracking error on nav also as a final comment to your plan if it were me i 'd personally pay off the student loans with any money i had after contributing enough to my employer 401k to maximize matching   the net effect of paying down the loans is a guaranteed avg 5.3 annually given what you 've said whereas any investments in 401k or ira are at risk and have no such guarantee   in fact with there being reasonable arguments that this has been an excessively long bull market you might figure your chances of a 5.3 or better return are pretty low for new money put into an ira or 401k today   that said i 'm long on stocks still but then i do n't have debt besides my mortgage at the moment   if i were n't so conservative i 'd be looking to maximize my leverage in the continued low rate environment

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

you can evaluate portfolio raw returns or risk adjusted returns to evaluate raw returns i would personally compute the total returns over the time period in question for both portfolios   to compute total returns split the time into a bunch of by the dates at which you contributed money   compute each return by dividing the value of the portfolio at the end of the but before adding additional cash on that day by the value at the beginning of the after adding cash on that day   then multiply all these returns together   finally subtract 1   that 's your total return for the portfolio where you did n't add any money it 's easy just divide the end value by the beginning and subtract 1 whichever has a higher return performed better to compute risk adjusted returns get the portfolio returns from both portfolios daily or monthly and use to regress on a benchmark portfolio return something like the s&p500   the intercept of the regression is a measure of the risk adjusted of your portfolio   higher the better   more sophisticated models will do multiple regression using a few benchmark portfolios at the same time

in almost all cases gifts from employers are considered taxable compensation based on the employer employee nature of the relationship furthermore cash gifts are always considered to be intended as wages regardless of how you receive the money furthermore regardless of whether you expect to receive anything in return such as contractual consideration or whether the amounts are large enough to be declared as taxable personal gifts it is likely that the irs would consider these payments to be disguised wages as these payments would fail several tests that the irs uses to determine whether benefits provided by the employer are non taxable including i 'd recommend reviewing irs publication 535 here as well as publication here for more on what constitutes taxable wages benefits it seems very unlikely to me that you could make a persuasive legal defense in which you claimed to be working full time for $ 60.00 per year and just happened to be receiving large personal gifts of $ in my opinion it seems much more likely that these payments would be found to be taxable wages for services rendered

politics is pretty utterly fucked is n't it   haha i think that 's the one thing most sides can agree on   gt;that 's interesting and i 've heard it before is something like this writer outlines what you are thinking essentially remove corporate taxes and then tax dividends and capital gains as normal income   yeah i like the idea for a few reasons incentivizes investments in america capital is far more mobile than labor or even capital owners gets rid of of tax avoidance sticks taxation exactly where we want it in this case capital owners instead of random incidence among labor capital consumers and cuts other losses inherent in a corporate income tax   it 's really hard for me to understand why almost anyone would be against this it 's a progressive pro growth anti crony idea

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything

operation twist is just an asset swap the balance sheet is n't being expanded money is n't being printed to buy treasuries the fed is just selling short term assets and buying longer term assets if more longer term treasuries are bought this brings the yield down for bonds the more you buy them the lower the yield goes lower long term interest rates means people can borrow at low rates and this is supposed help the economy    no printing of money means that gold does n't get more precious    i do think gold will do well though if the ecb wants to save the eu they 're going to have to print and print a lot the bank of england is doing some qe too lots of countries will are easing

sadly most jurisdictions do n't think this way when they assign property taxes   you have x acres our standard for this county is $ y per acre so you owe $ property taxes     and if you tax by dwelling size and features you are saying a poor person can not live in a nice house   lets say joe millionaire buys a fancy $ 2 m house with a fancy pool and all the trimmings   sure joe millionaire can afford the high taxes of say $ 20k year   but what if jim who makes only $ 35k year spends 10 years and about $ 100k building a similar nice house out of scrap materials he finds purchases on sale or on craigslist etc   he rents a and   a gun and builds himself a fancy pool it really nice and the county comes in and says well jim that 's a $ 2 m house you owe us $ 20k year in taxes for it   jim ca n't afford it and the county takes his house for unpaid taxes   screw you and your efforts poor person   and before you say he can just sell it for $ 2 m well what if he made it unique to his tastes and no one wants to buy it   or the market is bad right now     and yes this has happened to someone i know though the house was valued at $ 500 k he still could n't afford the taxes   and since it was not yet fully finished he had to sell it for only about $ 100k after working on it for several years   so yes as long as you want to make sure poor people can not live in nice places property tax is the way to go

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

be sure to consider the difference between roth 401 k and standard 401k. the roth 401 k is taxed as income then put into your account so the money you put into the roth 401 k is taxed as income for the current year however any interest you accumulate over the years is not taxed when you withdraw the money   so to break it down you may also want to look into self directed 401 k which can be either standard or roth check if your employer supports this type of account but if you 're self employed or 1099 it may be a good option

you need to negotiate with your broker to allow you to do more exotic order types   one in particular i recommend is a hidden aka iceberg order   you enter two numbers   the first is the number of shares for your entire order the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book this is the tip of the iceberg the remaining shares are hidden below the surface the maker taker rule applies as follows the amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity   the amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity example you want to sell 10,000 shares total   you enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed   on the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled   you receive a rebate for 1,000 shares you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares also like one of the previous posters mentioned only trade high liquidity stocks   large market cap companies with high volume   this is why day traders love tesla amazon netflix etc large market cap high volume and high volatility   easy to catch $ 10 + moves in price hope this helps happy trading

i see some merit in the other answers which are all based on the snowball method however i would like to present an alternative approach which would be the optimal way in case you have perfect self control given your amount of debt most likely you currently do not have perfect self control but we will come to that the first step is to think about what the minimum amount of emergency funds are that you need and to compare this number with your credit card limit if your limits are such that your credit cards can still cover potential emergency expenses use all of the 4000 $ to repay the debt on the loan with the higher interest rate some answer wrote that others may disagree as it is more efficient to pay down the however if you pay it all of within the year the difference only comes to $ 260 this is bad advice because you will probably not pay back the loan within one year where would you miraculously obtain 20 000 $ for that thus paying back the higher interest loan will save you more money than just next follow 's advice and refinance your debt under a lower rate this is much more impactful than choosing the right loan to repay make sure to consult with different banks to get the best rate reducing your interest rate has utmost priority from your accumulated debt we can probably infer that you do not have perfect self control and will be able to minimize your spending maximize your debt repayments thus you need to incentivize yourself to follow such behavior a powerful way to do this is to have a family member or very close friend monitor your purchase and saving behavior if you can not control yourself someone else must it should rather be a a person you trust than the banks you owe money

sec form 3 and sec form 4 are filed when insiders make share derivatives acquisitions transfers sells and buys there is a time limit after the action where they can be filed such as 12 business days so this can be a substantial amount of time after the effect on the market depending on your strategy you can aggregate these forms from sec sources or from third party websites and services in some cases types of insider trading are permissible at certain intervals so if you learn about when certain shares become unlocked you can try to predict what insider actions will be and share price movements around those times

dividends are normally paid in cash so do n't generally affect your portfolio aside from a slight increase to cash   you get a check for them or your broker would deposit the funds into a money market account for you   there is sometimes an option to re invest dividends see 's answer regarding dividend re investment plans as tom au described the dividends are set by the board of directors and announced   also as he indicated just before the record date a stock which pays dividends is worth slightly more reflecting the value of the dividend that will be paid to anyone holding the stock on the record date and goes down by the dividend amount immediately after that date since you 'd now have to hold the stock till the next record date to get a dividend   in general unless there 's a big change in the landscape such as in late 2008 most companies pay out about the same dividend each time and changes to this are sometimes seen by some as indicators of company health and such news can result in movement in the stock price when you look at a basic quote on a ticker symbol there is usually a line for div yeild which gives the amount of dividend paid per share and the relative yeild as a percentage of the stock price   if a company has been paying dividends this field will have values in it if a company does not pay a dividend it will be blank or say na depending on where you get the quote   this is the easiest way to see if a company pays a dividend or not   for example if you look at this quote for google you can see it pays no dividend   now in terms of telling when and how much of a dividend has been paid most financial sites have the option when viewing a stock chart to show the dividend payments   if you expand the chart to show at least a year you can see when and how much was paid in terms of dividends   for example you can see from this chart that msft pays dividends once a quarter and used to pay out 13 cents but recently changed to 16 cents    if you were to float your mouse over one of those icons it would also give the date the dividend was paid

no not deductible but if you work more than one job you run the risk of having too much ss withheld each employer does n't know what the others pays you tax time this   and much thanks to dilip for the following clarification not only does each employer not know what the others pays you but even if you tell him he will not care he is required to withhold social security tax on the wages he pays you and send in an equal amount as his contribution regardless of what anyone else pays you if the sum of your taxable wages from all employers exceed the maximum wages subject to social security the excess withholding is credited towards the income tax due and thus reduces the amount to be paid or increases the refund you are owed but the employer 's excess contribution that he sent in is not returned to him also there is no such things as excess medicare tax having been withheld because there is no maximum wage beyond which medicare tax does not apply

lets consider what would happen if you invested $ plus $ 10k down in a property or did the same in a low cost index fund over the 30 year term that most mortgages take   the returns of either scenarios can not be guaranteed but there are long term analyses that shows the stock market can be expected to return about 7 compounded yearly this does n't mean each year will return 7 some years will be negative and some will be much higher but that over a long span the average will reach 7   using a time value of money calculator that down payment monthly additions of $ 1,500 and a 7 annual return would be worth about $ 1.8 m in 30 years if 1.8 m were invested you could safely withdraw $ for the rest of your life do consider of inflation makes this less than today 's dollar   there are long term analyses that show real estate more or less keeps track with inflation at 2 4 annual returns this does n't consider real estate taxes maintenance insurance and the very individual and localized issues with your market and your particular house is land limited where you are increasing your price will new development drive down your price   in 30 years you 'll own the house outright you 'll still need to pay property tax and insurance on it and you 'll be getting rental income over those 30 years you can expect to replace a roof 2 3 hot water heaters concrete work several trees decades of snow shoveling mowing grass and weeding your hvac system windows and doors and probably a kitchen and bathroom you will have paid about 1.5x the initial price of the mortgage in interest along the way   so you 'll have whatever the rental price for your house monthly probably almost impossible to predict for a single family home plus the market price of your house again very difficult to predict but could safely say it keeps pace with inflation minus your expenses   there are scenarios where you could beat the stock market there are ways to reduce the lifestyle burden of being a landlord   along the way should you want to purchase a house for yourself to live in you 'll have to prove the rental income is steady to qualify for a loan having equity in a mortgage gives you something to borrow against in a heloc of course you could easily end up owing more than your house is worth in that situation   personally i 'd stick to investing that money in low fee index funds

both us gaap and are accrual basis frameworks 99.9 of businesses report under those frameworks or their local but still accrual based usually it 's public sector entities which are cash basis in my experience    anyway accrual basis has more to do with revenue recognition not taxation so that 's not really relevant here the value date of an invoice ie in which moment it becomes taxable depends on tax legislation which sets the rules to determine the so called date of taxable event not so much on accounting principles    in many cases taxable rules are intertwined with cash collection payment however to prevent creative accounting for tax evasion purposes for example provisions for various uncertain future events might be required by accounting rules but the corresponding expenses are generally not deductible for tax purposes so you wo n't be able to deduct them until the event actually occurs and you pay

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

so from a business perspective this way of building a piece of software does n't make any sense at all to take their example of a book trading app how do you parse out the core function vs. the revised specifications adding features the core function of most apps are dead nuts simple for the book trading app the core functionality is a forum website such as reddit the need for an app which allows you to sell it is the value add of the software which is all in the features    call the standard way of doing things from a set specification a top down design cycle call the new way of designing a bottom up design cycle    so now you have a minimum viable product which is now subject to all the pain of a top down design cycle and you are back to where you started now every bottom up design cycle has a goal and its own minimum viable feature improvement so you are really back to a progression of top down design cycles on bottom up product feature set evolution    making a real product that people use is always going to be a combination of top down design driven from the business side who determines the features that customers want i.e. the minimum viable product and bottom up design cycles where engineering has to communicate what is possible to design in a certain time frame there is always a tension between the forward looking business side which is trying to project what customers want and pushing engineering to schedule their creativity and the engineering side which is trying to deliver creative product designs on an externally imposed schedule    this bottom up design cycle is not unique to software where developing software differs from developing hardware is that software allows for this design cycle to be very short and very discrete software can be developed in discrete modules and linked together hardware is more integrated thus having longer design cycles but can still be designed using a minimum viable product with design cycles adding features incrementally look at the cell phone smart phone hardware business for a good case study in this yearly design cycles each design cycle has a minimum viable feature set and some stretch goals and work on feature sets stop when the clock runs out but to think that software is magic should be driven entirely bottom up does n't have some sort of feature map on the workflow is to get lost in an better to use top down and bottom up design cycles as tools to navigate the business

i have n't used transfer wise so ca n't speak to their price    regardless of what service you use what you should look for is whether the conversion price is greater than how much you think the currency 's price will move    example if your bank charges on any currency exchange you should ask yourself whether you think the pound or whatever currency will drop by within whatever time frame you 've set for yourself if not you 're better off keeping your money in that currency    i checked out their site and it does look like transferwise is pretty inexpensive around in transaction costs so again ask yourself whether you think the pound will drop by 1 in your time frame does n't seem like a lot but also consider that currencies typically fluctuate by just a few of a percentage per day    i know you 're probably looking for an answer like pound will drop sell it all but i do n't know enough about currencies to be giving advice there i would definitely pay attention to brexit negotiations though as that will be one of the biggest influences on both currencies for quite some time

this answer relies on why you are holding shares of a company in the first place so let 's address that so does this mean you would like to vote with your shares on the directions the company takes if so your reasons for selling would be different from the next speculator who only is interested in share price volatility regardless of your participation in potential voting rights associated with your share ownership a different reason to sell is based on if your fundamental reasons for investing in the company have changed   enhancements on this topic include trade management how to deal with position sizes buying and selling partial positions based on price action while keeping a core long term position but this is not something long term investors generally put too much effort in price targets start your long term investment with a price target in mind derived from a future market cap based on your initial fundamental analysis of the company 's prospects and finally there are a lot of things you can do with a profitable investment in shares

yes there are a lot of places you can research stocks online google finance yahoo finance reuters etc it 's important to understand that the price of the stock does n't actually mean anything   share price is just a function of the market capitalization divided by the number of shares outstanding   as an example take two companies that are both worth $ 1 million but company a has issued 10,000 shares and company b has issued 100,000 shares   company a has a share price of $ 100 while company b has a share price of just $ 10   comparing share price does nothing to indicate the relative value or health of company a versus company b.    i know there are supposed to be no product recommendations but the dictionary area of investopedia.com is a good source of beginner investing information   and as joe points out below the questions here with the stock tag would also be a good place to start   and while i 'm on a roll the book a random walk down wall street is a good starting point in investing in the stock market

if the price of the property 1 increases a lot you will just break even on the huge expenses of home owning if the price of the property 2 increases a huge amount you will make lots of money due to the leverage if the price of the property 3 stays even you will lose a tremendous amount of money it 's much like owning a car constant expenses that 's all there is to it it 's well worth bearing in mind that property prices for your area your property need to be constantly increasing for you to merely break even note that over long periods of time prices tend to go up most anywhere but not everywhere many people basically base their thinking on that it will be ok in the long run which is fair enough i believe one huge factor is that it is enforced saving that is the number one advantage for most note too that in most all jurisdictions there are tremendous tax advantages even if it turns out to be situation 1 i.e. a waste of time you only break even note finally that there are indeed tremendous social financial advantages to having the equity it gets incredibly easy to get other loans for business or the like once you own a house this is undeniably an advantage perhaps press your husband on that one

regarding interest on idle cash   brokerage firms must maintain a segregated account on the brokerage firm 's books to make sure that the client 's money and the firm 's money is not intermingled and clients funds are not used for operational purposes source    thus brokerage firms do not earn interest on cash that is held unused in client accounts regarding exchanges pay firm for liquidity i am not aware of any circumstances under which an exchange will pay a brokerage any such fee   in fact the opposite is the case   exchanges charge participants to transact business see how the nyse makes money similarly market makers do not pay a broker to transact business on their behalf   they charge the broker a commission just like the broker charges their client a commission   of course a large broker may also be acting as market maker or deal directly with the exchange in which case no such commission will be incurred by the broker   in any case the broker will pay a commission to the clearing house

i do n't have a reference but i think it depends on when you entered the workforce if you finished school at age 24 your primary goals are to pay down expensive debt and to save up enough for a down payment   so essentially not much   maybe $ 5k to $ 10k at the most on the other hand if you entered the workforce at age 20 with no debts and no significant expenses it should have been easy to sock away 20 of your income for 6 years so $ 40k to $ 50k would be reasonable the difference is that the first person 's income earning potential should be higher so eventually they 'd be able to make up the difference and pass them

it 's not so much a matter of your age as it is a matter of what your current tax rate is vs. what your tax rate will be when you take out the money   as long as your current tax rate is lower than what you anticipate it will be when you withdraw the money it makes sense to pay the tax now of course you ca n't know for certain what your tax rate will be when you take out your money but the answer for most people is going to be higher than it is now   some reasons why as you age you start to lose deductions home mortgage gets paid off kids grow up and move out   you likely wo n't gain any new deductions that would lower your tax rate as you age you 'll only lose them tax rates now are historically low and budget deficits are high   that means that higher tax rates are almost certainly coming so unless your circumstances are very unusual i would pretty much always recommend saving after tax dollars now that i 've said that i 'll throw a small wrench into that plan when you save with a roth ira you are paying taxes today with the anticipation that you wo n't have to pay taxes later   but this may not necessarily be the case the government could decide to tax roth ira gains in the future would be a very unpopular move but if they decided to do it who 's to stop them the government could change the tax system by lowering income tax rates and creating a vat or instituting something like the flat tax   your roth money is exempt from income tax but not from a vat or national sales tax so you also need to consider the possibility of those things happening and how that would affect you   ten years ago nobody would have dreamed of the us having a vat but now it looks more and more possible

when i did my csc back in the day when there was 1 4 hour exam and 2 assignments fuck i 'm old this is what i did   i took the week after new years off and studied exclusively for the csc   i did nothing else but study but i had done a lot of prep before then i wrote the exam after a week of non stop study   to be honest the exam is n't difficult at least the finance parts   the tricky parts are the pure memorization ones which are almost all compliance ethics questions e.g. how long do you have to notify the of a change in address etc   do not ignore these sections as they do test on ethics compliance a lot

this seems almost overkill but if you want to i suppose one thing you could do is create a separate money in transit account similar to account payable and account receivable in your bookkeeping transfer the money from the source account to the holding account on the date that the source bank withdraws it and then transfer the money to the destination account on the date that the target bank deposits it this both makes it clear that there is money going between places and ensures that the daily balance on each physical account is accurate for cash withdrawals and deposits i 'd just use the date when you make the withdrawal since that is the day from which the money is available in the new location rather than the old one note i do n't know if this is the proper way to do it in a random jurisdiction but i doubt being this explicit can get you into trouble

yes you can transfer money to your account any bank will do it the conversion charges will be there i.e. the diff between usd and the rate at which the bank sells it usually rs in addition transaction charge not very high as for taking from friends repaying in india check uae tax for taking money from friends is it considered as your income are you liable for taxes as for giving back get some documentation done as a loan otherwise your friends may be considered to be taking gift consideration income from you and taxed most straight forward way is to transfer the money from your mother 's account

you will definitely want to look into odd jobs if possible i 'm sure this sounds patronizing but the biggest problem you have right now is your credit card debt most likely at very high interest rates you said you have enough to make your payments but you did nt specify what that meant are you making the minimum payments only    if you 're only making the minimum payments you 'll want to really find some way to even an extra $ 50 together each month odd jobs specifically you might also want to try where you get paid to fill out surveys you see by making only the minimum payment you are actually probably only putting a few dollars at all to principal most of the rest went to last month 's interest charges    the best thing to do is lay out each card and what the interest rate is you have 9 of them so this seems like a bit of a task   the first step is to identify which card has the highest interest rate there are two things you can do then you either throw every extra penny you have at that specific card or you find some way to move that balance to your lowest interest rate card    in all cases your goal is to move debt from the high interest rate cards to the low interest rate cards once you ca n't move debt around anymore your goal then is to pay only the minimums on all the low interest rate cards and put every single spare penny you have towards the higher ones    if you do n't mind me asking can you outline all 9 cards and how much you owe on each adn what each 's interest rate is   it 's possible you do n't know and that 's problem one if you do n't know the interest rate of each card then you do n't even really know which card you should be paying off first    edit how do you spend on food a month if you were really really determined to get over this you 'd basically just eat rice and beans or buy nearly bad bananas and eggs these are the cheapest you can find

interesting as i am in the exact same situations as yourself   i in fact just incorporated   you will be able save more in taxes in the end   the reason i put save in quotes is that you do n't necessarily save on taxes but you can defer taxes   the driving factor behind this is that you specify your own fiscal calendar year   incorporating allows you to defer income for up to 6 months   meaning that if you make your fiscal year starting in august or september for example you can claim that income on the following year august + 6 months = february   it allows you to keep the current year taxes down   also any income left over at year end is taxed at 15 the corporation rate rather than the 30 40 personal rate you get with a sole proprietorship   in a nutshell with sole proprietorship all income is taxable after write offs in a corporation you can take some of that income and keep it in the corporation gives your company a value and is only taxed at 15 big saving there i primarily work with us businesses   i am however a dual citizen us and canadian which allowed me as a sole proprietor to easily work with us companies   however as a sole proprietor or a corporation you simply need to get an ein from the irs and any us company will report earnings to that number with no deductions   at year end it is your responsibility to file the necessary tax forms and pay the necessary taxes to both countries   therefore you can solicit new us business if you choose but this is not restricted to corporations   the real benefit in incorporating is what i mentioned above my suggestion to you is to speak with you ca who can outline all benefits   revenue canada 's website had some good information on this topic as well please let me know if you need anything else explained

debt increases your exposure to risk   what happens if you lose your job or a major expense comes up and you have to make a hard decision about skipping a loan payment   being debt free means you are n't paying money to the bank in interest and that 's money that can go into your pocket debt can be a useful tool however   it 's all about what you do with the money you borrow   will you be able to get something back that is worth more than the interest of the loan a good example is your education   how much more money will you make with a college degree   is it more than you will be paying in interest over the life of the loan   then it was probably worth it instead of paying down your loans can you invest that money into something with a better rate of rate of return than the interest rate of the loan   for example why pay off your 3 student loan if you can invest in a stock with a 6 return   the money goes to better use if it is invested   note that most investments count as taxable income so you have to factor taxes into your effective rate of return the caveat to this is that most investments have at least some risk associated with them   stocks do n't always go up   you have to weigh this when deciding to invest vs pay down debts   paying down the debt is more of a sure thing another thing to consider if you have a long term loan several years paying extra principal on a loan early on can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan due to power of compound interest   extra payments on a mortgage or student loan can be a wise move   just make sure you are paying down the principal not the interest   and check for early repayment penalties

in my experience earning interest is not enough to keep the account in a non dormant state if payment of interest was the trigger to reset the clock then no savings account would ever be considered dormant in general as the account got close to the deadline we were notified that a single transaction moving money into or out of the account would reset the clock i have had this happen in recent years with a bank account and a credit union account   in researching for the exact definition of a dormant account i found this regarding interest on the fdic website that means that the state law may set the definition it also means that you should look at the information regarding the bank policy i did try and see if the rules for a credit union are the same the added twist with a credit union is that if the account is closed they are no longer a share holder and that brings into the discussion voting rights so the policy guidelines is even more complex if the account does go inactive state law will define what happens to the account and how you can get the funds back

given that the laws on consumer liability for unauthorized transactions mean no cost in most cases the cvv is there to protect the merchant   typically a merchant will receive a lower cost from their bank to process the transaction with the cvv code versus without as far as the netflix case goes or any other recurring billing for that matter they would n't care as much about it because visa mc amex regulations prohibit storage of the cvv   so if they collect it then it 's only used for the first transaction and just use the rest of the card info name expiration date address does the presence of cvv indicate the merchant has better security   maybe maybe not   it probably means they care about their costs and want to pay the bank as little as possible to process the transaction

the fundamental issue with leverage of any sort really is that the amplified downsides are extremely likely to more than cancel out amplified equivalent upsides example without using a major swing 2x leverage on a 5 decline so a 10 decline   the 5 decline needs a increase to get back level   however the 2x leverage needs an increase to get back   so a cycle for the unleveraged returns of -5 + 5.4 would see the unleveraged asset go up by a net + but 2x leverage would leave you at   conversely imagine leverage it 's easy to do that 50 cash allocation after an underlying -5 the leverage needs only + to reach par   this is basically the argument for low volatility funds of course if you can leverage an asset that does n't go down then the leverage is great   and for an asset with an overall positive compound return a little leverage is probably not going to hurt simply because there are likely to be enough upsides to cancel out downsides

it depends on what kind of pension you get and your anticipated retirement income   if you have one of those nice defined benefit plans that pays 90 of your last 5 years average salary annually you might not want to bother with a separate rrsp and put your money into other use instead while most canadians should worry about not having enough to retire on some might end up with too much and costing them in the form current purchases and entitlements to government retirement benefits figuring out how much you need for retirement is not trivial either   a lot of people talks about planning for needing 70 of what you made now as a way to preserve your lifestyle   well my opinion is that those type of generalization might work for the people in the middle of the income band and is too little for those in the low income and possibly too much for those with high income   my own approach is estimate your retirement income requirement by listing out your anticipated expenses as if you were doing budget   i would agree that 's not the best approach either back to my comment about no one size fits all but it 's one that i feel most comfortable with once you have that figure factor in what you think you will get from the government oas cpp and etc and you will have the amount of money you need for retirement   i will warn against using average life expectancy to forecast your retirement needs 50 of the people will end up with extra money not a bad problem and the other 50 will run out of money bad but very true problem if you use that approach instead of going on and write an essay on this topic i will simply say this everyone 's situation is different and just like solving any other complex problems you need to start with end in mind and work things backward with a ton of different scenario to be able to cope with whatever life might throw at you   if you spend enough time in the library bookstore looking through books on the topic of estate planning and retirement planning you will find people arguing back and fro on these topics this is a sign that this is complex and no one has the one good answer for   do a bit of reading by yourself and if still unsure or just want to be sure go spend the money and review your plan with a fee only advisor   they will be able to provide another opinion on your situation after thoroughly studying your situation

i like your question and think it is a pretty good one   generally speaking i would not suggest talking about your stock picks or wealth   here is why 1   most people are broke   seventy eight percent of the us population report living paycheck to paycheck   more than a majority do not have enough in savings to cover a $ 500 repair to a car or dryer    what kind of money advice will you get from broke people the general population   answer   bad 2   it targets you for jealousy negative feelings   if you discuss this kind of thing with your broke friends they will have negative feelings toward you   this is not necessarily a bad thing   if you want to build wealth a aspect of that is having wealthy friends   they will have the kind of disposable income to do the kinds of things you want to do   they can alert you to good investment opportunities   and your income will tend to increase   most people 's income resides within 10 of their 10 closest friends    3   you can be targeted for law suits   given that personal injury attorneys work on contingent they are very good at picking on defendants with deep pockets or really good insurance   knowing that you have significant investments will put a bit of a target on your back   having said all of that you could participate in groups with a similar interest in investing   back in the late 80 's investment clubs were all the rage and you might be able to find one of those online or at the local library or something   that would be a far safer

there are a few factors at play here depending on the bank that has offered you the card there are different types of overdraft protection that may have been set up typically if they attempt to run the card with no money if one of these is in play you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account usually savings or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds   if you know the transaction went through and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions then you have a few options if you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account then you have nothing to worry about if you do not most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least $ 0   if this is a charge that occurred in the past and you have already been charged an overdraft fee there may still be hope i can not speak for all banks but i know that chase bank offers a once per year overdraft forgiveness where they will get rid of the charges if you agree to bring the account out of the negative there is a chance other banks will do the same if you call their customer service

if you are planning to get new cards it is probably best to open the accounts as soon as possible to start establishing a history of good credit use you might also wish to open multiple accounts so that future lines will have less of an impact on your average age of open credit lines since you will probably have higher interest rates it is also advisable never to carry a balance on any of your newly acquired cards this will prevent a recurrence of the problems you are now trying to recover from

yes that is not an unusual number in some states the state tax rate is fairly flat and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat the big issue is the federal number several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income and the taxes though the net check will get smaller keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer the tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same for those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck the average paycheck for the first part of the year this can put you in a higher bracket than you should be and result in a large refund when you file in the spring   you can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding

well that is not entirely accurate but the sentiment is true if jeff himself liquidated the stock it would cause concern because he is the driving force at amazon but whether or not the stock price is driven up or down is more about where demand meets supply rather than simply supply    for example almost every time a company buys out a public corporation they pay a premium for the exact opposite effect you 're talking about though it 's the same logic if you are wanted to sell 40 of a company you owned you would likely do it this way    if jeff announced he   was retiring and had good leadership set into place after him and then created a buyout of his 40 he would likely get 30 50 more than the stock is currently worth so there are a lot of factors

in a strictly mathematical sense no or rather it depends what long run means   say today the home average is $ 200 k and payment is $ the $ 900 today happens to be about 20 of the median us monthly income which is approximately $ housing rises income in 100 years long enough the house costs $ 10 m but incomes are only $ yr and the mortgage even at the same rate is $ 45k month or to be clear it rose to 52 of monthly income   my observation is that long term the median home costs what 25 of median income will support in terms of the mortgage after downpayment long term that means that if you graph this you 'll see trends above and below the long term line you 'll see a 25 year bubble form starting in the late 80 's as rates dropped from near 18 to the in the early but once you normalize it to percent of income to pay the loan much of the bubble is flattened out at 18 $ bought you a $ 100 k mortgage but at 3.5 it bought $ this is in absolute dollars wages also rose during that time i am just clarifying how rates distort the long term trends and create the short term anomalies

two points you do n't really get the full 10,000 annual interest as tax free income   well you do but you would have gotten a substantial amount of that anyway as the standard deduction from the irs standard deduction the standard deduction for married couples filing a joint return is at $ for 2012 the standard deduction for single individuals and married couples filing separate returns is $ for 2012 the standard deduction for heads of household increases by $ 50 to $ for 2012 so if you were married it would n't even make sense to claim the 10,000 mortgage interest deduction as the standard one is larger it can make sense to do what you are talking about but ultimately you have to decide what the effective interest rate on your mortgage is and if you can afford it for instance   i might have a 5 mortgage   if i am in a 20 tax bracket it effectively is a 4 mortgage to me   even though i am saving tax money i am still paying effectively 4   ultimately the variables are too complex to generalize any hard and fast rules but it often times does make sense you should also be aware that there has been some talk of eliminating or phasing out the mortgage interest deduction as a way to close the deficit and reduce the debt

if a company is doing well it seems less likely to go bankrupt   if a company is doing poorly it seems more likely to go bankrupt   the problem is where is the inflection point between well and poorly   when does a company start to head into oblivion   sometimes it is hard to know   but if you do n't call that right and hold onto your shares when a company is tanking others who call it before you do will sell off devalue the share price and now you 've missed your chance to get out at a good profit   if you hang on too long the company may just go bankrupt and you 've lost your investment entirely a healthy profitability of the company therefore has to bolster investor confidence in avoiding this very unpleasant scenario   therefore the more profitable a company is the more shareholder confidence it and the more willing to pay for it in the form of increased share price   and this then has a meta effect in that each shareholder thinks all other investors think this way too and so each feels good about holding the stock since he knows he can likely easily liquidate it for good cash if he needs to either now or in the next year or sometime hence

personally i think you are approaching this from the wrong angle   you 're somewhat correct in assuming that what you 're reading is usually some kind of marketing material   systematic investment plan sip is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world   dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the us on average verified by many studies individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners   say you decide to invest in a mutual fund dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying when you feel the market is low as an example i 'll compare investing $ 50 per week on versus 1 share per week on or the full $ 850 on the first wednesday    i 'll use the vanguard large cap fund as an example   i realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different i just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle   by investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs   it also keeps your investment easy to budget vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments which is illustrated in the third column above and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing ultimately all of these companies are to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique   if they all called dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging none of them would appear to be unique   so they devise neat acronyms but it 's all pretty much the same idea   trickle your money in to your investments as the money becomes available to you

i 've addressed some of the problems with the new fiduciary rule in other threads but basically no one is arguing that advisors should n't be fiduciaries of course they should and the vast majority do what this rule effectively does is simply alter the way that advisors are compensated on retirement assets such as 401(k 's by forcing them to hold these assets in ria accounts this is not necessarily in the best interest of the client yes i am aware of the best interest contract exemption or perhaps more importantly these types of regulations should be handled by one of the already existing regulator bodies the sec or finra to bring in the dol as a third regulatory body is a bit redundant to say the least   i think a far easier solution in concept at least is that any finra registered advisor which is basically all advisors aside from pure insurance agents should be held to the fiduciary standard and not simply the suitability standard

you 're confusing a specific visual representation of the top bid ask orders selected from the order book with the actual top of the book   top in the sense of the top of the book is a ranking by order of best different for bids vs. asks and not meant to be strictly a visual positioning on a page or screen the data in the visual representation comes from the top of the order book the best bids and the best asks but that visual representation is choosing to present it in a specific way think of the book as the model the abstract collection of outstanding bid and ask order data   when people talk about the top of the book they 're talking about the best bids higher being better and the best asks lower being better the visual representation above is but one possible way to render a tip of the iceberg view of the best orders in the book   the advantage of that particular visual representation is that one can see the asks bids towards the center   the spread is visible as the difference between the two middle elements being the lowest row in the blue asks area and the highest row in the green bids area the up arrow they had included in the asks area was perhaps meant to provide a clue about how the data was sorted contrary to expectations of descending order of and/or to imply there is further depth to the book data in the indicated direction if the bids asks had been oriented side by side instead they might have chosen to represent it as below re arranging the rows in the asks in the opposite order i.e. in the order you had expected so that the are both in the top row

all things being equal a $ job with 25 benefit load is about $ that 's a little more than $ your rate really depends on the nature of the work if it 's strictly a part time job where you are an employee you 're probably looking at a $ 28 range if you 're an independent contractor the rate should be higher as you 're paying the taxes doing other administrative stuff how much higher depends on the industry software it rates are usually 1.5 2x construction is driven by the union scale in many places etc note that you need to meet criteria defined by the irs to successfully maintain independent contractor status from a tax pov

well that 's about 3 higher than the national average so i 'm not sure if we should be relieved or disturbed   personally i find it that insurance companies are allowed to randomly exclude pesky unprofitable things they do n't want to cover   floods   no thanks   dental vision   why ever would you consider those medical issues   uninsured drivers   yeah you live in a state that requires 100 of drivers have insurance but suck it anyway since you have no choice hahaha   and people seriously wonder why i utterly loathe insurance companies   insurance fraud should be viewed not as a crime but as the moral high ground it 's insurance itself that is little short of fraud hidden in font

in regards to purchasing full coverage on your car even if you can afford to replace it consider the hassle you have to deal with an accident that is not just the cost   as an example my sister 's car was stolen and wrecked   it was her problem to go recover the car on the other side of the state such that she would not be paying the storage fees imposed by the sheriff of the other county   had she had insurance they would have taken care of it call another story is that i rented a car and side swiped in the parking lot by a hit and run   i was responsible for the minor damage   i started down the path of paying out of pocket because it was small enough that i did not want to submit a claim   the rental car agency started to pile on extra fees such that it was worth it to turn in a claim   my insurance company was savvy enough to be able to dispute the extra charges   after i submitted it to the insurance company i basically did nothing   they took care of everything so in summary when you buy full coverage on your car it is not just a financial decision   it is also about not having to deal with a hassle

a good question there are many good tactical points in other answers but i wanted to emphasize two strategic points to think about in your 5-year plan both of which involve around diversification expense allocation you have several potential expenses actually expenses is n't the right word it 's more like applications think of the money you have as a resource that you can pour because money has liquidity into multiple buckets depending on time horizon and risk tolerance an ultra short term cushion for extreme emergencies e.g.   things go really wrong this should be something you can access at a moment 's notice from a bank account for example your car has been and they need cash a short term cushion for emergencies something bad happens and you need the money in a few days or weeks a cd ladder is good for this it pays better interest and you can get the money out quick with a minimal penalty a long term savings cushion you might want to make a down payment on a house or a car but you know it 's some years off for this an investment account is good there are quite a few index funds out there which have very low expenses and will get you a better return than cds savings account with some risk tolerance retirement savings $ 1 now can be worth a huge amount of money to you in 40 years if you invest it wisely here 's where the ira or 401 k if you get a job comes in you need to put these in this order of priority put enough money in your short term to be 99 confident you have enough then with the remainder put most of it in an investment account but some of it in a retirement account the thing to realize is that you need to make the retirement account off limits so you do n't want to put too much money there but the earlier you can get started in a retirement account the better i 'm 38 and i started both an investment and a retirement account at age 24 they 're now to the point where i save more income on average from the returns in my investments than i can save from my salary but i wish i had started a few years earlier income you need to come up with some idea of what your range of net income after living expenses is likely to be over the next five years so that you can make decisions about your savings allocation are you in good health or bad are you single or do you have a family are you working towards law school or medical school and need to borrow money are you planning on getting a job with a dependable salary or do you plan on being self employed where there is more uncertainty in your income these are all factors that will help you decide how important short term and long term savings are to your 5-year plan in short there is no one place you should put your money but be smart about it and you 'll give yourself a good head start in your personal finances good luck

correct by putting expenses on to a credit card which does not charge interest during the grace period and paying that balance every month in effect you earn interest on money you 've already spent however first savings account interest is something like .05 right now depending on your bank yeah it 's money but seriously that 's 4 cents per month on $ 1000   second two things can make this very wrong if you carry a balance you 'll pay much more in interest than you 'd get from practically any investment you could make with the cash in the meantime second a debit card can be used to get cash you already have from an atm not everyone takes credit you know and it 'll cost you little or nothing use a credit card for the same purpose and you 're paying 40 from the second the money comes out of the machine also correct rewards cards earn you more the more they 're used that 's because the card issuer makes money based on usage they get 3 of each transaction they 're happy to turn 1 of that up to a limit or subject to a spending floor back around to you again check the terms and conditions most cards have a limit on total rewards many of them also have fees either while you hold the card or when you try to redeem the rewards look for a card with high limits or no limits on rewards from spending and with no annual fee or reward redemption fee in addition to the above you build good credit history with good spending patterns however your credit score can fluctuate wildly because on one day you have very low leverage percent of credit limit used and on the next you 've bought $ 200 in groceries and so your leverage went up 20 on a card with a $ 1000 limit leverage under 10 is good leverage under 40 is ok and leverage over that starts looking bad with a $ 1000 limit with you maxing it out and then paying it off your credit score can fluctuate by 30 points on any given day

why would a lender for a down payment want proof of income for a house when a credit card issuer gave me more and does n't care the risk profile and rate of interest are different   could i use this argument as a basis that they have no reasoning to request proof of income if another lender credit card company would give me more without proof of repayment you could argue anything but it does not mean the other company will agree with your argument should i borrow a home loan from a credit card company then or what 's the catch here you can check the rate of interest and fees you would realize how much you will end up paying depending on the country the difference could be in the region of 10 15

as others have said the decision is a very personal one personally i think you have a good idea for those of us that thrive in structured systems having a detailed breakdown and distribution of assets is a great idea i recommend going one step further however instead of having a single necessities account have a division here 1 account for bills and another for living expenses your bills account should recieve the funds to pay your monthly expenses such as rent utilities insurance living expenses is for day to day spending i recommend this because your bills are generally a fairly fixed expense keeping your flexible spending separate allows you to manage it more carefully and helps prevent overspending   i keep my living expenses in cash and divide it up by the number of days before my next check every day i put my portion of the living expenses in my wallet this way i know that i can spend as much money in my wallet and still be fine for the rest of the pay period i also know that if i want to go out to a nice dinner on friday it would be helpful if i have money left over at the end of the day monday through thursday

it sounds like you 're comparing 1 the backdoor roth ira and 2 the mega backdoor roth although the names are similar they are considerably different and not mutually exclusive the goal of the backdoor roth ira is to contribute to a roth ira even if you are over the income limits this is accomplished by contributing to a non deductible traditional ira and then converting to roth both of these steps have no income limit unlike a direct roth ira contribution which does and only the earnings which should be minimal will be taxed more info here mirror the goal of the mega backdoor roth is to get a lot of money into roth accounts through salary deferral this is accomplished by making non roth after tax contributions to your 401(k after exhausting the $ 18,000 limit in 2017 for pre tax + roth employee contributions the after tax contributions potentially up to $ 36,000 for 2017 can be rolled over to the roth 401(k or to a roth ira while the earnings can be rolled over to the pre tax 401(k or a traditional ira or taxed like regular income and converted to roth along with the contributions more info here mirror

why do banks charge a significantly lesser rate for a 15 yr fixed mortgage than a 30yr though they know it will not earn them the same amount of money   a simplistic model of where banks get the money to lend to borrowers is that they borrow money from investors that want to earn a return on the money that they provide   the actual mechanics of that process are much more complicated but the gist is that if those investors want to tie their money up for a longer period they expect to get a higher return thus 30-year mortgages require a higher interest rate than 15-year mortgages   in addition the usual consensus in the market is that interest rates will rise in the future so interest rates for longer term loans are higher   while it 's true that the bank gets more money overall from a higher rate mortgage the fact that that additional money does n't come until several years into the loan and that money loses value over time due to inflation makes a lower rate 15 year mortgage roughly equivalent to a higher rate 30-year mortgage

the question that i walk away with is what is the cost of the downside protection disclaimer i do n't sell anything i am not a fan of insurance as an investment with rare exceptions i 'll stop there all else is a tangent there 's an appeal to looking at the distribution of stock returns it looks a bit like a bell curve with a median at 10 or so and a standard deviation of 15 or so this implies that there are some number of years on average that the market will be down and others about 2/3 up now you wish to purchase a way of avoiding that negative return and need to ask yourself what it 's worth to do so   the insurance company tells you a 2 off the top i.e. no dividends and b we will clip the high end over 9.5   i then am compelled to look at the numbers knowing that your product ca n't be bought and sold every year it 's appropriate to look at rolling returns the annual returns i see and the return you 'd have in any period i start with 1900 2012 i see an average 9.8 with std of 5.3 remember the 10 year rolling will do a good job pushing the std down the return the insurance would give you is an average 5.4 with std of .01 you 've bought your way out of all risk but at what cost   from 1900 2012 my dollar grows to $ yours to $ for much of the time treasuries were higher than your return much higher   it 's interesting to see how often the market is over 10 for the year clip too many of those and you really lose out   from 1900 2012 i count 31 negative years ouch but 64 years over 9.5 the 31 averaged the 64   the illusion of market gains is how this product is sold long term they lag safe treasuries

if you enter a futures contract it costs nothing   so every time prices move against you there is a margin call and you must put up some new money inverse etf 's use a variety of similar strategies to get their returns   many of these strategies may indeed require a margin call to the etf issuer if prices move against you   but remember the etf did not cost nothing   investors contributed money in order to purchase each share of the etf   therefore the etf issuer has a big pot of money available for use as margin   that 's why the margin call never comes through to you in a sense you posted a ton of margin up front so you wo n't have to make any additional margin contributions   the money that will be used for margin calls is being kept in treasuries and money market securities by the etf issuer until it 's needed if prices move against you badly enough that it looks like the etf is at risk to not be able to post margin the etf would liquidate and you 'd get whatever pittance was left after they exit all those positions

not minutes but hours   the ex dividend date is the deadline for acquiring a stock to receive a dividend if you hold a stock at the beginning of this day you will receive the dividend so you could buy a stock right at the end of the day on the day before the ex dividend date and sell it the next day on the ex dividend date and you would get your dividend see this page from the sec for more information   the problem with this strategy however is that the value of the stock typically drops by the same amount as the dividend on that day if you take a look at the historical price of the stock you are interested in you 'll see this of course it makes sense why a seller knows that selling before   the date results in a loss of the dividend so they want a higher price to compensate likewise a buyer on or after the date knows that the dividend is already gone so they want to pay a lower price

amazon makes enormous profits they just re invest nearly all of it their 2016 operating income was $ 20b assume they spent $ 0 on r&amp;d but they did spend $ 16b on r&amp;d. which is more than what apple spends    facebook is more valuable than cisco for many reasons first off similar net incomes on their statements does n't mean those net incomes are as safe in the future facebook might have a very safe revenue stream from ads regardless if they keep updating their interfaces perhaps facebook 's market saturation means they do n't need much infrastructure expansion in the future which would project reduced costs and higher margins    cisco on the other hand might perpetually be in a more dangerous spot given their market position they have competition and they might have to be in a constant battle to stay caught up their margins are also much less than facebook 's perhaps cisco 's profits are also more at risk due to changes in public policy while facebook is more insulted    valuation on the market goes far beyond just the profit on the last income statement
