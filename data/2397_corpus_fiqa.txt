supposedly this also means that i am free from having to pay    california corporate taxes not in the slightest since you the corporate employee reside in ca the corporation is doing business in ca and is liable for ca taxes or does this mean i am required to pay both ca taxes and delaware    fees in this case minimal just a paid agent from i believe de actually does have corporate taxes check it out but the bottom line is yes you 're liable for both ca and de costs of doing corporate business income taxes registered agents ca corp fee etc is there any benefit at all for me to be a delaware c corp or should i    dissolve and start over or just re incorporate as california llc unless you intend to go public anytime soon or raise money from vcs investors there 's no benefit whatsoever in incorporating in de you should seek a legal advice with an attorney of course since benefits are legal issues usually related to choosing jurisdiction for litigation etc if you 're a one person freelancer doing c corp was not the best decision as well tax wise you 'd be much better off with a s corp or a llc both pass through and have no federal entity level taxes corporate rates are generally higher than individual rates and less deductions can be taken in california check with a cpa ea licensed in the state since both s corp and llc would be taxed and taxed differently

i agree that the cause of the crash can make a huge difference in the effect on the bond market here 's a few other possibilities all that to say that there 's no definitive answer as to how the bond market will respond to an equity crash   bonds are much more highly correlated to equities lately but that could be due to much lower interest rates pushing more of the risk of bonds to the credit worthiness of the issuer increasing correlation

been digging through all the eu vat and have called hmrc as well there does not seem to be any lower for charging vat into the eu if you sell £ 10 of goods services you have to charge vat and file a vat return your options are 1 register for moss and file a single vat return in your home country for all countries in the uk this means that you also have to be vat registered and have to charge vat locally as well even if you are below the uk threshold 2 register and file a vat return in every eu country you sell into   you also have to apply the correct vat rate for each country typically 15 to 27 and you have to keep at least two pieces of evidence for the customer location eg billing address ip address etc

as far as i can recall savings and chequing accounts exist due to regulations on the banking industry that put were into effect after the depression to prevent a run on the bank    a chequing account is a demand account meaning you can go and demand your money and they have to pay immediately by means of a withdrawal or a cheque   banks used to get out of hand and loan out pretty much all the money they had on deposit and of course those people with loans just put the money they borrowed into another chequing account and the bank loaned that out to someone else   the money that people believed they had access to multiplied indefinitely   however when everyone goes to take that money out at the same time you have a run on the bank   therefore government regulations stipulate a that the bank must have on hand   the typical number is 5   that effectively limits the money multiplier to 19 times savings accounts get around this restriction by putting limits on how much and how quickly you can withdraw the amounts   they pay you more interest because the money in a savings account is worth more to them because it 's not subject to those restrictions some chequing accounts pay interest but you have to maintain a minimum balance   some savings accounts allow you to write cheques but i assume the withdrawal limitations probably still apply there 's also something to do with deposit insurance as in the chequing accounts are covered by government deposit insurance but savings accounts are not   i 'm not 100 certain of that though

the basic equation taught in day one of accounting school is that assets = liabilities + equity my first point was that i looked at the actual financial statements published as of the end of the 2nd quarter 2017 and the total liabilities on their audited balance sheet were like $ 13 billion not $ 20b i do n't know where the author got their numbers from   my second point debt usually needs to be paid on terms agreed upon by the debtor and the including interest so it is important for a business to keep track of what they owe and to whom so they can make timely payments as long as they have the cash on hand to make payments plus whatever interest they owe and the owners are happy with the total return on their investment then it does n't really matter how debt they have on the balance sheet   remember the equation a = there are precisely two ways to finance a business that wants to acquire assets liabilities and/or equity the appropriate level of debt vs equity on a balance sheet varies wildly and totally depends on the industry size of the business cash flow personal preferences of the ceo cfo shareholders et al etc     it gets way more detailed and complicated than that obviously but the point is that looking at debt alone is a meaningless metric this is corporate finance and accounting 101 so you can probably find tons of great articles and videos if you want to learn more

you 're confusing a lot of things here company b llc will have it 's sales run under company a llc and cease operating as a separate entity these two are contradicting each other if b llc ceases to exist it is not going to have it 's sales run under a llc since there will be no sales to run for a non existent company what happens is that you merge b llc into a llc and then convert a llc into s corp. so you 're cancelling the ein for b llc you 're cancelling the ein for a llc because both entities cease to exist you then create a ein for a corp which is the converted a llc and you create a dba where a corp dba b shop you then go to the bank and open the account for a corp dba b shop with the ein you just created for a corp. get a better accountant before you convert to s corp

i do n't have any specific situation on the situation in austria but in general there are a few things that you should keep in mind first of all the official website of the austrian tax authorities appears to be this one there is an english page there but it is mainly aimed at international businesses the part about tax treaties may be relevant though the general procedure is outlined here like i said in my comment most information is likely only available in german i would strongly advise to ask help from someone who speaks german and is familiar with the tax system in austria the main thing that you would have to do first is to check of which country you are a resident for tax purposes this is usually the country in which you lived for more than 183 days in the past year if you moved during the year and had income from more than one country you may have to file tax returns in both countries there are tax treaties between austria and the uk and most other countries so you would have to check those treaties to find out what gets taxed where in principle you get taxed only once but usually you would have to declare all income the last important thing is of course to make sure you submit before the relevant deadlines

which people   there are 7 billion people in the world the majority of them are relatively poor and the reasons why they either remain so or are able and willing to change their status the reasons vary tremendously   alas i think the author missed the point of the statement the woman made he began with a belief the poor at all times and them making up a surround of force from which it seems they can not escape i had come to understand that this was what kept the poor from being political and that the absence of politics in their lives was what kept them poor   and he really never looked outside of the context of his own biased view   the key in is hidden in the middle of his statements of belief above the it seems they can not escape   that is what the woman was addressing the it seems and escape   in fact many do escape historically speaking most of the us population are of such   when the things surrounding them are massive then it takes a lot of courage and humility and willingness to sacrifice amp risk to leave those surroundings and venture out into the great unknown potentially having to endure a lot of hardship and possibly failing when there   so the biggest hurdle they have to overcome is an identical belief that the author had at the beginning and seems to have still maintained   it is n't about politics at least not in the modern sense of the word

yep you 're single you 're possibly still a dependent on your parent 's taxes in lieu of rent and you 're finally bringing home bacon instead of bacon bits welcome to the working world let 's say your gross salary is the u.s. median of $ 50,000 with bi weekly checks 26 a year common practice you 're getting $ per paycheck in the 2013 percentage method tax tables here 's how your federal withholding is calculated as a single person paid biweekly federal taxes are computed the amount up to a is taxed at x% then the amount between a and b is taxed at y% so if you make $ c between a and b the tax is + c the amount is included in the base amount for ease of calculation back to our example let 's say you 're getting $ gross wages per check that puts you in the 25 marginal bracket you pay the sum of all lesser brackets which is the base amount of the 25 bracket plus the 25 marginal rate on every dollar that falls within the bracket that 's + .25 = + .25 = + = $ per paycheck the effective tax rate on the total amount as if you were being charged a flat tax is and this is just for the federal income tax add to this ma state income taxes 5.25 flat tax fica aka medicare 1.45 flat and aka social security 6.2 up to a wage base that $ 50k does n't even approach and your effective tax rate on each dollar you earn is + 5.25 + 1.45 + 6.2 = this does n't include any state unemployment taxes that may be withheld separately but as the rate i come up with is pretty darn close to what you 've figured meaning i slightly overestimated your gross income and thus your effective tax rate my bet is that 's either employer paid in ma or it 's just part of ma state income tax it gets better at least at the federal level the amount of your state income taxes is tax deductible at the federal level if you itemize your deductions that may not be a factor for you as you 'd have to come up with more than $ of other tax deductible expenses to make itemizing the better option than taking the standard deduction big ticket items are mortgage expenses other than principal payments hospital stays such as for or major accident and state and local taxes such as sales property and income if you can claim yourself as a dependent meaning your parents ca n't then $ 150 of each check $ 3,900 of your annual salary is no longer taxed for federal withholding lowering the amount of money taxed at the 25 marginal rate you effectively save $ biweekly $ annually in taxes get married and file jointly and your spouse her personal exemption and an extra standard deduction amount if you do n't itemize go on your taxes the tax rates for married couples filing jointly are also lower they 're currently calculated or were in 2012 to be the same as if two equal earners were to file separately so if your spouse does n't work your taxes on the single income are calculated at the rates you 'd get if you earned half as much it does n't work out to half the taxes but it is a significant marriage advantage have kids and each one is another little $ 3,900 tax write off it 's nowhere near the cost of having or raising the child but it helps and having kids is n't about the money owning a home making charitable deductions having medical expenses etc are a toss up the magic number in 2013 is $ for a married couple $ for a single person if your mortgage interest insurance premiums property taxes medical expenditures charitable donations any contributions from your take home pay to a tax deferred savings account typically these accounts are paid into by your employer as a pre tax deduction and never show up as taxable income but you could just as easily move money from your take home pay into tax deferred savings and any other tax deductible payments add up to more than 12 large then itemize if not take your standard deduction as a single taxpayer just starting out in life you probably do n't have any of these types of expenditures certainly not enough to give up the sd i did the math on my own taxes in 2012 and was surprised at how little the government actually gets of my paycheck when all 's said and done remember back in the summer of 2012 when everyone was mad at romney for making millions and only paying an effective income tax rate of 14 which was compared to the middle class 's marginal rate of 25 28 well my family of 3 living on a little more than the median income from one earner me taking the married standard deduction three personal exemptions and a little extra for student loan interest paid an effective federal income tax rate of something like 3.5 of course the fica and ss taxes do n't allow any deductions not even for retirement savings so add in the 4.2 ss in 2012 and 1.45 fica and the full federal gimme was more like 9 10

one reason it matters whether or not you 're beating the s&p 500 or the wilshire 5000 or whatever benchmark you choose to use is to determine whether or not you 'd be better off investing in an index fund or some other investment vehicle instead of pursuing whatever your current investment strategy happens to be   even if your investment strategy makes money earning what the s&p 500 has averaged over multiple decades around 10 with an index fund means a lot more money than a 5 return with an actively managed portfolio especially when you consider factors like compound interest and inflation i use the s&p 500 as one of my criteria for judging how well or poorly my financial adviser is doing for me if his recommendations or trading activity on my behalf if authorized are inferior to the s&p 500 for too long then i have a basis to the relationship check out this wikipedia entry on stock market indices there are legitimate criticisms but on the whole i think they are useful as an aside the reason i point to index funds specifically is that they are the one of the lowest cost fire and forget investment strategies around   if you compare the return of the s&p 500 index over multiple decades with most actively managed mutual funds the s&p 500 index comes out ahead

i disagree that they are taxis which is why i think that consumers should realize they do n't offer the same protections   the argument for more regulations is that taxis have regulations to keep people safe   well ok let 's go with that premise people are ok with ride sharing services because of the many added benefits but they also know that these services are n't taxis does everyone who uses them know they might be taking on an additional risk probably not but i 'd guess most people would be ok with fewer protections in order to use the added value from these services   basically it should n't have to be a level playing field if consumers willingly forfeit the protections taxis offer then that is their choice

you 're misunderstanding the concept of retirement savings ira distributions are taxed in their entirety as ordinary income if you withdraw before the retirement age additional 10 penalty is added investment income has preferential treatment long term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income however ira contributions are tax deductible i.e. you do n't pay taxes on the amounts contributed to the ira when you earned the money only when you withdraw in the mean time the money is growing tax free based on your investments anything inside the ira is tax free including dividends distributions from funds to your ira not from ira to you capital gains etc this is very powerful when taking into account the compounding effect of reinvesting your dividends sale proceeds without taking a chunk out for taxes consider you make an investment in a fund that appreciated 100 in half a year you cash out to reinvest in something less volatile to lock the gains in a regular account you pay taxes when you sell based on your brackets in the ira you reinvest all of your sale proceeds that would be ~25 35 more of the gains to reinvest and continue working for you however if you decide to withdraw you pay ordinary rate taxes on the whole amount if you would invest in a single fund for 30 years in a regular account you 'd pay 20 capital gains tax on the appreciation not the dividends in the ira if you invest in the same fund for the same period you 'll pay your ordinary income rates however the benefit of reinvesting dividends tax free the blow somewhat but that 's much harder to quantify bottom line if you want to plan for retirement plan for retirment otherwise ira is not an investment vehicle also consider roth ira conversions roth ira has the benefit of tax free distributions at retirement if your current tax bracket is at 20 for example contributing $ 5 k to roth ira instead of a traditional will cost you $ 1 k of taxes now but will save you all the taxes during the retirement for the distributions from the roth ira it may be very much worth your while especially if you can contribute directly to roth ira there are some income limitations and you can withdraw contributions but not earnings from roth ira something you can not do with a traditional ira

the of the deduction is based on what the borrowed money is used to purchase and not what asset is used as collateral   so at the beginning of your mortgage 10 of the interest is deductible because the entire loan was used to purchase the condo   but when you withdraw money from the account the additional interest is usually not deductible   it can get confusing with all the withdrawals and payments that will be coming in and out of the account if you happen to use it a lot like a chequing account an easy example would be if you only paid the interest on the loan   say you had a $ 100 000 loan at 5 apy for simplicity 's sake   after one year you would have paid $ 5000 interest   $ 500 of the would be deductible given that your office is 10 of the condo   then you buy a $ 1000 couch and continue to only pay interest for the next year   you would have paid $ interest   $ 5000 on money borrowed to buy the condo and $ 100 on money borrowed to buy the couch   so you can still only deduct $ 500 what happens when you pay back $ 500 against the line of credit   could you designate that 100 of the money should be applied to the non deductible interest   or does it have to applied proportionally   i do n't know i think it 'd would be wise to separate the loans somehow   may even have some tools to facilitate that   however i would n't recommend the one product   i looked into when i was buying my house two years ago and at that time it was too expensive   the rate was the same that other banks were charging for a home equity line of credit which was prime at the time   you can replicate the one in a cheaper way using a traditional mortgage and a home equity line of credit   the majority of the loan will be the traditional mortgage at hopefully a cheap rate   then you can use your line of credit as the chequing account

i find the question interesting but it 's beyond an intelligent answer   say what you will about jim cramer his advice to spend an hour per month on each stock you own appears good to me but it also limits the number of stocks you can own given that most of us have day jobs in other fields you need to decide how much time and education you can put in that said there 's a certain pleasure in picking stocks buying a company that 's out of favor but your instinct tells you otherwise for us individual stocks are about 10 of total portfolio the rest is indexed the amount that should be in individual stocks none one can invest in low cost funds never own shares of individual stocks and do quite well

most people on reddit do n't seem to get any system they 're talking about and this is the perfect example    the patent was approved before the sale it takes about 2 years to get a non controversial patent in the us maybe they were in talks for this acquisition 2 1/2 years ago but that 's somewhat unlikely given the timelines for most acquisitions    it would be so far and away more valuable to amazon to prevent a shopper at a competitor from seeing that they could get the same product for 30 less on amazon than to ever prevent someone in their forthcoming brick and mortar empire from doing it   as far as a brick and mortar store goes groceries is also a very low margin one yes they picked the high end market that would be better than your average safeway bi lo or walmart but it 's also a relatively small one compared to the alternatives and i think it 's dumb to expect that to make a difference groceries are the final frontier for amazon as far as making sure they can deliver anything anywhere today it 's basically having cold storage warehouses in every metro area without having to build them    edit yeah there was a missed double negative there obviously it 's in their interest to keep other businesses from preventing people in their stores from realizing they can get things cheaper on amazon

this is kind of a silly article and it mostly misses the point   first google and others essentially have in house investment banking departments that are vetting valuing negotiating and sealing these deals these m&amp;a guys are mostly former bankers    so while they may not be using investment banks they are certainly using bankers google has $ in cash and does dozens and dozens of acquisitions each year it 's not surprising they find it appealing to move the banking function in house    second certain tech companies like google and facebook and zynga have unique corporate structures where the ceo founders retain majority voting control of their companies    this means guys like zuckerberg page brin et al control over 50 of all voting shares and they can not be ousted by the board of directors nor can they be on any matter via a proxy battle this gives these founders far reaching control over m&amp;a and thus you see deals like the $ cash + stock whatsapp acquisition and instagram both of these deals were reportedly driven by zuckerberg himself who not only initiated and vetted the deals but determined the price    most ceos do not have this kind of latitude    third within silicon valley the network is very small and tight and everybody knows each other the ceos founders vcs etc they all know each other and they know who to call when they are looking to acquire   it 's not like zuck needs a banker to tell him to check out snapchat

first currencies are not an investment they are a medium of exchange that is you use currency to buy goods and services and/or investments the goods and services you intend to buy in your retirement are presumably going to be bought in your country to buy these you will need your country 's currency the investments you intend to buy now require the currency of whatever country they are located in if you want to buy shares in microsoft you need usd if you want shares in bhp you need aud or gbp it is traded on two exchanges if you want property in kuwait you need and if you want bonds in your country you need when you sell these later to buy the goods and services you were saving for you need to convert from whatever currency you get for selling them into whatever currency you need to buy when you invest you are taking on risk for which you expect to be compensated for the higher the risk you take the better the returns had better be because there is always the chance that they will be negative right down to losing it all if you are unlucky there is no 100 safe investment if you want to make sure you get full value for your money spend it all right now if you invest overseas then in addition to all the other investment risks you are adding currency risk as well that is the risk that when you redeem your investments the overseas currency will have fallen relative you your currency one of the best ways of mitigating risk is diversification which allows the same return at a lower risk or a higher return at the same risk a pure equity portfolio is not diversified across asset classes hopefully it is diversified across the equities equities are a high risk high yield class particularly in a developing economy like indonesia if you are very young with a decades long investment horizon this may be ok but even then a diversified portfolio will probably offer better rewards at the same risk diversifying into local cash bonds and property with a little foreign equities bonds and property will serve you better than worrying about the strength of the oh and pay a professional for some real advice rather than listening to strangers on the internet

the short answer to your question is yes   company performance affects stock price only through investors views but note that selling for higher and lower prices when the company is doing well or poorly is not an arbitrary choice   a stock is a claim on the future cash flows of the firm which ultimately come from its future profits   if the company is doing well investors will likely expect that there will large cash flows dividends in the future and be willing to pay more to hold it or require more to sell it    the price of a stock is equal what people think the future dividends are worth   if market participants started behaving irrationally like not reacting to changes in the expected future cash flows then arbitrageurs would make a ton of money trading against them until the situation was

a mutual fund makes distributions of its dividends and capital gains usually once a year or or quarterly or monthly etc it does not distribute any capital losses to its shareholders but holds them for offsetting capital gains in future years cf this answer of mine to a different question a stock pays   dividends a stock neither has nor does it   distribute capital gains you get capital gains or losses when you sell the shares of the stock but these are not called distributions of any kind similarly you incur capital gains or losses when you   redeem shares of mutual funds but these are not called distributions   either note that non etf mutual fund shares are generally not bought and sold on stock exchanges you buy shares directly from the fund and you sell shares back redeem them directly to the fund   all of the above transactions are taxable events for the year to you unless the shares are being held in a tax deferred account or are tax free for other reasons e.g. dividends from a municipal bond fund

that price is the post tender price which already reflects arbitrage   it 's less than $ 65 on the market because that 's the highest offer out there and the market price reflects the risk that the $ 65 will not be paid   it also reflects the time value of money until the cash is disbursed including blows to liquidity in other words you are buying the stock burdened with the risk that it might rapidly deflate if the deal falls through or gets at a lower price or that your money might be better spent somewhere other than waiting for the i bank to release the tender offer amount to you two months ago traded around $ 55 and four months ago it traded around $ 50   if the deal fails then you could be stuck either taking a big loss to get out of the stock or waiting months or longer in the hope that another deal will come along and pay $ 65 which may leave you with npv loss from today   the market seems to think that risk is pretty small but it 's still there if the payout is $ 65 then you get a discount for time value and a discount for failed merger risk   that means the price is less than $ 65   you can still make money on it if the merger goes through   some investors believe they have a better way to make money and no doubt the tender offer of the merger of two publicly traded companies is already heavily arbitraged   but that said it may still pay off tender offer arbitrage is discussed in this article

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

transactions cost is what kills you here the price of determining who gets what and then enforcing it    for example let 's say you invested in my electrical engineering class then when i get out of school i go to work at starbucks where i 'm applying literally none of that knowledge or experience and thus i signed a bad deal   or what if i change majors you still have a stake on my lifetime income but it wo n't be in the field you helped me into so college aged indecision would mean twice as much out of my take home income for life   or what if i 'd like to buy your percentage back from you what would be a fair price would there be a market to establish it   you should read the unincorporated man which has a system very similar to what you 're proposing    in this story education and subsistence investment have become expensive so in order to send a kid through college you 're actually purchasing shares of an individual 's future earnings like they 're a corporation parents get 10 when you 're born government gets 5 in lieu of taxes these shares have a market value based on income expenditures health etc pricing individuals just like you 'd price a company   in the story most individuals have sold over 50 of their shares meaning that they effectively do n't have controlling interest over their lives their jobs their homes all their major decisions are made by the shareholders so you might take a high risk job just because one of your biggest shareholders wants a payday   of course since it 's on the open market you can buy your shares back once you 're back over 50 you 're back in control of your life and the majority of your income the way the author it it 's a pretty comprehensive system and the book stays ambiguous as to whether it 's debt slavery or a new evolution of liberty   but again transactions costs think of six billion little corporations with all their vital stats and market data now imagine voting on the jobs and homes of the potentially hundreds of people in whom you have an interest it would simply be impossible to keep track of   honestly it 'd probably be more modest to just pay your student loans

my observations is that this seems like hardly enough to kill    inflation is he right or are there better ways to invest the tax deferral part of the equation is n't what dominates regarding whether your 401k beats 30 years of inflation it is the return on investment   if your 401k account tanks due to a prolonged market crash just as you retire then you might have been better off stashing the money in the bank   remember 401k money at now + 30 years is not a guaranteed return though many speak as though it were   there is also the question as to whether fees will eat up some of your return and whether the funds your 401k invests in are good ones i 'm uneasy with the autopilot nature of the typical 401k non strategy it 's too much the standard thing to do in the u.s. it 's too and strikes me as ponzi like   it has been a winning strategy for some already sure and maybe it will work for the next 30 100 years or more   i just do n't know   there are also changes in policy or other unknowns that 30 years will bring so it takes faith i do n't have to lock away a large chunk of my savings in something i ca n't touch without hassle and penalty until then for that reason i have contributed very little to my 403b previously contribute nothing now though employer does automatically   i have no match and have built up a sizable cash savings some of which may be used to start a business or buy a house with a small or no mortgage thereby guaranteeing at least not paying mortgage interest   i am open to changing my mind about all this but am glad i 've been able to at least save a chunk to give me some options that i can exercise in the next 5 10 years if i want instead of having to wait 25 or more

interest rates are always given annually to make them comparable if you prefer to calculate the rate or the total interest for the complete time like 10 years or 15 years or 30 years it is simple math and it tells you the total you will pay but it is not helpful for picking the better or even the right offer for your situation compare it to your car 's gas what sense does it make to provide the information that a car will use 5000 gallons of gas over its lifetime is that better than a car that uses 6000 gallons but may live 2 years longer

an asset is something which you own that has a monetary value some examples would be your car your house the money in your wallet and yes the pile of gold in your garage assets also include intangible things such as money owed to you for instance although these are calculated somewhat differently liabilities are what you owe for instance your car loan your mortgage and your student loan liabilities can also include future debts which you may not be paying at the moment

while this question is old and i generally agree with the answers given i think there 's another angle that needs a little insurance if you go with an 84 month loan your car will likely be worth less than the amount owed for substantially all of the entire 84 month loan period this will be exacerbated if you put zero down and include the taxes and fees in the amount borrowed   your lender will require you to carry full comprehensive collision liability coverage likely with a low maximum deductible   while the car is underwater it will probably also be a good idea to carry gap insurance because the last thing you want to do is write a check to your lender to shore up the loan to value deficit if the thing is totaled   these long term car loans i 've seen as high as 96 months are a bear when it comes to depreciation and related insurance costs there is more to this decision than the interest calculation    obviously if you had the cash at the front of this decision presumably you 'll have the cash later to pay off the loan at your convenience   but while the loan is outstanding there are costs beyond interest to consider

your comment is more related to economics rather than finance you 're right that with conventional everyday goods that value is an entirely subjective thing economists formalize this idea with the notion that people 's preferences determine market prices   in finance though fundamental value relates to the value of the cash flows produced by a financial asset in terms we 're talking about exchange value what can i get if i take this bond stock and sell it the value i get should be equivalent to the monetary value of the cashflows produced by that asset over time discounting for uncertainty etc so fundamental value is a bit more objective in finance since these things produce something quasi objective cash

it depends a lot on your investment period and the quality of the bonds that you want to invest for example if you want to invest until the maturity of the bonds and the bonds are very safe i.e. they are not expected to default it does not matter that the interest rate rise that is because at the maturity of the bond it will converge to its maturity value which will be independent of the change of the interest rates although on the middle of the life the price of the bond will go down but the coupon should remain constant is a floating coupon an option could be to invest in an etf with short term bonds e.g. 1 year with aaa credit rating high quality so very low default rate it wo n't yield much but is more than 0 if you hold it until maturity

scenario 2 is most likely will generate the best long term financial outcome if your friends emergency fund is truly excessive and can afford to be reduced by the amount required to payoff the vehicle loan then that will save a few dollars scenario 3 is not an approach i would recommend however if your friend has to choose between paying off the loan or maxing his roth making a few assumptions regarding the loan i figure it is probably a 4 year $ which means he is paying somewhere below $ 40 a month in interest   as speaks to people often over estimate the spread they can make with another investment compared to the interest rate on a loan however the effect of compounded tax free returns can not be ignored when you are discussing a 22 year old person contributing to a roth ira   doing some calculations assuming the car is being paid off on the first payment your friend will save just under $ 1000 the total interest that would have been paid over the life of the loan if your friend adds $ 3600 approximately one year of payments to their roth ira contributions just once assuming a 3.5 avg return and a retirement age of 65 the $ 3600 will be worth just south of $ 16k a $ return using the same investment return and tax assumptions and simplifying the $ 1000 savings as if it was all realized as a lump sum at the time of paying off the loan that $ 1000 invested in a non tax advantaged investment because the whole discussion is based on if the friend had to pick and lose the opportunity for the one year to make the additional roth ira contribution would return $

in general i 'd advise you to do it the other way around in the future    know what your plan is and what you need for it before reaching out publicly that way you can respond more quickly and answer questions more easily    as for the meeting you basically need to prepare three things    1 what do you need to know when the meeting is over 2 what can you offer the client 3 what is a fair price for your time   under 1 what kind of website do they want do you have complete freedom or do you have to work within their existing branding can you deliver what they 're asking for example if they want a cms to manage their portfolio can you build that   under 2 what 's your own portfolio like what can you use to convince the client you have the capabilities to deliver what they 're asking note the difference with 1 that 's if you can actually do it this is if you can convince them of that fact    under 3 determine what you 'd find a fair hourly wage so that during the meeting you can estimate what the total price should be and when you should consider backing out    finally you should consider what you 'll do if you run into complications as it 's your first client it 's good to give it some thought ahead of time but it probably wo n't come up during the meeting   as for being convincing if you get 2 right you should be confident that you can actually do what you promise if your portfolio is limited you can look up websites yourself for other interior designers before the meeting so that you can go over them with the client ask which elements the client does and does n't like summarize it in the end and affirm you can deliver something combining those things

for a parent deciding on contributing to a 529 plan the first consideration is the plan run by the state government that will trigger a state income tax deduction you do have to at least look at the annual fees for the program before jumping into the state program but for many people the state program offers the best deal because of the state tax deduction unfortunately for you california does not offer a state tax deduction for 529 plan contributions which means that you can pick another states program if the fees are more reasonable or if the investing options are better you can even select a nationwide plan with a state is run by tiaa cref tiaa cref is a large company that runs pension and 403(b funds for many state and local governments many teacher unions use them   they are legitimately authorized by the state of california the investment board sets investment policies and    oversees all activities of the state ’s 529 college    investment plan the program enables californians to save for college    by putting money in tax advantaged investments after tax    contributions allow earnings to grow tax deferred and disbursements    when used for tuition and other qualified expenses are federal and    state tax free the plan is managed by tiaa cref tuition    financing inc. the investment board also oversees the governor ’s    scholarship programs and california memorial scholarship program note before picking a plan from another state make sure that they allow outside contributions

the fact that you are choosing index fund means you are surely not one of those investors who can correctly judge dips but buying on dips is still important you can use a method called dollar value averaging it is better than dollar cost averaging just make sure you apply a lower limit and an upper limit to be more predictable suppose you have 10000 to invest use limits like minimum 200 investment when index is high maximum 600 investment when index is down and when index gives normal returns invest 400 do this for about 2 years more than 2 years is not recommended i myself use this method and benefit a lot

so the term ready market simply means that a market exists in which there are legitimate buy sell offers meaning there are investors willing to own or trade in the security a spot market means that the security commodity is being delivered immediately rather at some predetermined date in the future hence the term futures market   so if you buy oil on the spot market you 'd better be prepared to take immediate delivery where as when you buy a futures contract the transaction does n't happen until some later date   the advantage for futures contract sellers is the ability to lock in the price of what they 're selling as a hedge against the possibility of a price drop between now and when they can will deliver the commodity   in other words a farmer can pre sell his grain at a set price for some future delivery date so he can know what he 's going to get regardless of the price of grain at the time he delivers it   the downside to the farmer is that if grain prices rise higher than what he sold them for as futures contracts then he loses that additional money   that 's the advantage to the buyer who expects the price to rise so he can resell what he bought from the farmer at a profit when you trade on margin you 're basically borrowing the money to make a trade whether you 're trading long buying or short selling on a security   it is n't uncommon for traders to pledge securities they already own as collateral for a margin account and if they are unable to cover a margin call then those securities can be liquidated or confiscated to satisfy the debt   there still may even be a balance due after such a liquidation if the pledged securities do n't cover the margin call most of the time you pay a fee or interest rate on whatever you borrow on margin just like taking out a bank loan so if you 're going to trade on margin you have to include those costs in your calculations as to what you need to earn from your investment to make a profit when i short trade i 'm selling something i do n't own in the expectation i can buy it back later at a lower price and keep the difference   for instance if i think apple shares are going to take a steep drop at some point soon i can short them   so imagine i short sell 1000 shares of aapl at the current price of $ 112   that means my brokerage account is credited with the proceeds of the sale $ and i now owe my broker 1000 shares of aapl stock   if the stock drops to $ 100 and i cover my short buy the shares back to repay the 1000 i borrowed then i pay $ 100,000 for them and give them to my broker   i keep the difference $ 12,000 between what i sold them for and what i paid to buy them back minus any brokerage fees and fees the broker may charge me for short selling in conclusion a margin trade is using someone else 's money to make a trade whether it 's to buy more or to sell short   a short trade is selling shares i do n't even own because i think i can make money in the process i hope this helps

one advantage of paying down your primary residence is that you can refinance it later for 10 15 years when the balance is low refinancing a rental is much harder and interest rates are often higher for investors this also assumes that you can refinance for a lower rate in the nearest future the question is really which would you rather sell if you suddenly need the money i have rental properties and i 'd rather move myself than sell the investments because they are income generating unlike my own home so in your case i 'd pay off primary residence especially since the interest is already higher on it would be a harder decision if it was lower

i 've always understood inflation to be linked to individual currencies although my only research into the subject was an intro economics course in undergrad and i do n't recall seeing why that would be the case   i guess the basic principle is that currency traders are watching the printing presses and trading in exchange markets to the point that the exchange rates fall in relation to increases in money supply there 's probably something about the carry trade in there as well but it 's late and i took some medications so someone else will have to carry that torch i must admit i 've not really paid attention to foreign currencies like hkd but the proximity and political relationship with china probably greatly complicates your question since part of the problem has been china 's currency peg

this does not seem to me to be a very good indication regarding the    risk of the person not paying their balances off if you do not have a source of income then how are you going to repay your debt   not to mention there is for creditors to garnish wages   that is not possible if you have no income   the risk assessment is about the ability of the creditor to recover any moneys loaned and costs and still make a profit for example students have their parents pay them some pocket money to    cover for expenses or a person might be working on    consulting gigs that do not have a fixed monthly or yearly component most credit card companies that are willing to issue to college students will allow you to include money from your parents in your income   credit card companies are looking for customers that will carry a balance and incur fees but be able to pay them   these companies do not make money off of fees and interest that they do not collect   as such work increases risk is it possible for people to get approved for unsecured credit cards    if they do n't hold or have not held for some time a job at the time    of application i was able to while i was in college   though i did have a part time job   if you can show that you have the ability to pay you can usually get a credit card if you do not have bad credit   it will probably be high interest and have alot of fees some of them you will have to pay upfront   but what you probably mean to ask is is it possible to get a no cost unsecured credit card with out a reliable source of income   the answer to that is probably not   even the ones that look like they are free probably have hidden fees

its definitely not a stupid question the average american has absolutely no idea how this process works i know this might be annoying but i 'm answering without 100 certainty    the fed would increase the money supply by buying back government bonds this increased demand for bonds would raise their price and therefore lower the interest return that they deliver since u.s. treasury bonds are considered to be the very safest possible investment their rate is the risk free rate upon which all other rates are based so if the government buys billions of these bonds that much money ends up in the hands of whoever sold them these sellers are the large financial organizations that hold all of our money banks and large investment vehicles now since bond rates are lower they have an incentive to put that money somewhere else it goes into stocks and investment in business ventures    i 'm less certain about how this turns into inflation that consumers will recognize the short answer is that there is only a finite number of goods and services for us to buy if the amount of money increases and there are still the same number of goods and services the prices will increase slightly    your question about printing money to pay off debts is too complex for me to answer i know that the inflation dynamic does play a role it makes debts easier to pay off in the future than they seem right now however causing massive inflation to pay off debts brings a lot of other problems

do you plan a monthly budget at the beginning of each month   this might seem counter intuitive but hear me out doing a budget is of course critically important for those who struggle with having enough money to last the month   having this written spending plan allows people struggling with finances to control their spending and funnel money into debt reduction or saving goals   however budgeting can also help those with the opposite problem there are some like you perhaps that have enough income and live frugally enough that they do n't have to budget   their money comes in and they spend so little that the bank account grows automatically   it sounds like a good problem to have but your finances are still out of control just in a different way   perhaps you are simply because you do n't know if you will have enough money to last or not by making a spending plan you set aside money each month for various categories in three broad areas since you have plenty of money coming in generously fund these spending categories   as long as you have money in the categories when you go to the store you can feel comfortable splurging a little because you know that your other categories are funded and the money is there to pay those other bills   create other categories such as technology or home improvement and when you need an app or have a home improvement project you can confidently spend this money as it has already been allocated for those purposes if you are new to budgeting software such as ynab can make it much easier

i can not answer the original question but since there is a good deal of discussion about whether it 's credible at all here 's an answer that i got from bank of america note the fine difference between your account and our account which does not seem to be a typo the payment method is determined automatically by our system   one of    the main factors is the method by which pay to recipients prefer to    receive payments   if a payment can be issued electronically we    attempt to do so because it is the most efficient method    payment methods include electronic   payment is sent electronically prior to the deliver by date   the funds for the payment are deducted from your account on the    deliver by date corporate check   this is a check drawn on our account and is mailed to the pay to recipient a few days before the deliver by date   the    funds to cover the payment are deducted from your account on the    deliver by date laser draft check this is a check drawn on your account and mailed to the pay to recipient a few days before the deliver by date   the    funds for the payment are deducted from your account when the pay to    recipient cashes the check just as if you wrote the check yourself to determine how your payment was sent click the payments button in    your bill pay service   select the view payment link next to the    payment   payment information is then displayed   transmitted    electronically means the payment was sent electronically   payment    transaction number means the payment was sent via a check drawn from    our account   check number means the payment was sent as a laser    draft check each payment request is evaluated individually and may change each    time a payment processes    a payment may switch from one payment    method to another for a number of reasons   the merchant may have    temporarily switched the payment method to paper while they update    processing information   recent changes or re issuance of your payee    account number could alter the payment method in my case the web site reads a little different payment check 8 digits was sent to company on and    delivered on funds were withdrawn from your named    account on for one due on this must be the corporate check and for another earlier one due on this must be the laser draft check check 4 digits from your named account was mailed to company on    funds for this payment are withdrawn from your account    when the pay to account cashes the check both payments were made based on the same recurring bill pay payment that i set up manually knowing little more of the company than its address

if you are looking for numerical metrics i think the following are popular price earnings p e you mentioned this very popular one in your question   there are different p e ratios forward essentially an estimate of future earnings by management trailing etc   i think of the p e as a quick way to grade a company 's income statement i.e how much does the stock cost the amount of earnings being generated on a per share basis some caution must be taken when looking at the p e ratio   earnings can be by the company   revenue can be moved between quarters assets can be depreciated at different rates residual value of assets can be adjusted etc   knowing this the p e ratio alone does n't help me determine whether or not a stock is cheap in general i think an affordable stock is one whose p e is under 15 price book i look at the price book as a quick way to grade a company 's balance sheet   the book value of a company is the amount of cash that would be left if everything the company owned was sold and all debts paid i.e. the company 's net worth   the cash is then divided the outstanding shares and the price book can be computed   if a company had a price book under 1.0 then theoretically you could purchase the stock the company could be liquidated and you would end up with more money then what you paid for the stock this ratio attempts to answer how much does the stock cost based on the net worth of the company again this ratio can be by the company   asset values have to be estimated based on current market values think about trying to determine how much a company 's building is worth unless of course mark to market is suspended   this involves some estimating   again i do n't use this value alone in whether or not a stock is cheap i consider a price book value under 10 a good number    cash i look at growth in the cash balance of a company as a way to grade a company 's cash flow statement   is the cash account growing or not as they say cash is king   this is one measurement that can not be which is why i like it   the p e and price book can be tuned but in the end the company can not hide a shrinking cash balance return ratios return on equity is a measure of the amount of earnings being generated for a given amount of equity roe = liabilities   this attempts to measure how effective the company is at generating earnings with a given amount of equity   there is also return on assets which measures earnings returns based on the company 's assets i tend to think an roe over 15 is a good number these measurements rely on a company accurately reporting its financial condition   remember in the us companies are allowed to accounting reports if approved by the government so be careful   there are others who simply do n't follow the rules and report whatever numbers they like without penalty there are many others   these are just a few of the more popular ones   there are many other considerations to take into account as other posters have pointed out

both of the other answers are correct and good answers but i think neither directly answers your question no you do not need to pay additional taxes on the wedding gifts simply because of the fact that they are going into a roth ira   similarly if you put them into a traditional ira that amount would be deductible assuming you met the other criteria including minimums and maximums of earned income in both cases   the act of putting money into a roth ira is not what makes it taxable its original source is   roth simply does not reduce your current taxes any whereas a traditional ira would the seeming exception to this is when rolling money from a tax deductible source to a non tax deductible destination such as transferring money from a traditional ira or 401(k to a roth ira or 401(k   then the taxable event is really the distribution from the traditional ira or 401(k not the deposit into a roth ira or 401(k though of course if you rolled a 401(k over to a traditional ira it would not be taxable

there are several reasons it is not recommended to trade stocks pre- or post market meaning outside of regular trading hours since your question is not very detailed i have to assume you trade with a time horizon of at least more than a day meaning you do not trade intra day if this is true all of the above points are a non issue for you and a different set of points becomes important as a general rule using 3 is the safest regardless of what and how you trade because you get price guarantee in trade for execution guarantee in the case of mid to longer term trading 1 any of those points is viable depending on how you want to do things what your style is and what is the most comfortable for you a few remarks though 2 are market orders so if the open is quite the ride and you are in the back of the execution queue you can get significant slippage 1 may require live data of the post market session which is often not easy to come by for the entire us stock universe depending on your physical execution method phone fax online you may lack accurate information of the post market if you want to execute orders based on and only want to do that after hours because of personal schedule constraints this is not really important personally i would always recommend 3 independent of the use case because it allows you more control over your orders and their fills tl;dr if you are trading long term it does not really matter if you go down to the intra day level of holding time it becomes relevant

getting physical stocks will in most cases only be for the fun of it most stocks nowadays are registered electronically and thus the physical stock will be of no value it will just be a certificate saying that you own x amount of shares in company x but this information is at the same time registered electronically stocks are not like bearer bonds the certificate itself contains no value and is registered to each individual entity because the paper itself is worthless stealing it will not affect your amount of stock with the company   this is true for most stocks there may exist companies who live in the 70s and do not keep track of their stock electronically but i suspect it will only be very few and most likely very small and illiquid companies

the crucial insight is that the alternative to early exercise of an american call is not necessarily to hold it to expiry but to sell it and selling it at its value is always better than exercising it   note that this holds only for options on assets that do n't pay dividends here 's the proof using put call parity we know that at expiry t we have using a call and a put both struck at k = k if this is not clear to you consider the case where s is less than equal to or greater than k at maturity and go through each of them if the stock s does n't pay any dividends and there is no cost of carry etc we can replicate both sides now at time 0 we just buy one call sell one put that gives us the left hand side buy the stock and borrow money so that at time t we have to repay k that gives us the right hand side that means that now we only need to borrow df k where df is the discount factor and is less than one assuming the good old world where interest rates are positive thus c(0 = df k.   rearranging gives c(0 = df k +   that 's the value of the call if we sell it or hold it however if we exercise we only get = k now we see that c(0 > because we subtract less < k and add

one year is short term short enough that trying to predict returns is a crap shoot frankly if you will need the money in one year i would n't touch anything riskier than a money market account $ 5000 also is n't enough to give you much flexibility in achieving a balanced portfolio since the minimal initial purchase for mutual funds is often around $ 2500 i 'm not sure whether etfs would give you any more flexibility so on grounds of both size and time horizon i have to recommend against this plan the risk of losing money with insufficient time for gains to balance that risk is simply too high others may feel differently of course but that 's the best advice i can offer

an option gives you an option   that is you are n't buying any security you are simply buying an option to buy a security   the sole value of what you buy is the option to buy something an american option offers more flexibility i.e. it offers you more options on buying the stock   since you have more options the cost of the option is higher of course a good example makes sense why this is the case   consider the vix   options on the vix are european style   sometimes the vix spikes like crazy tripling in value in days   it usually comes back down pretty quick though within a couple of weeks   so far out options on the vix are n't worth just a whole lot more because the vix will probably   be back to normal   however if the person could have them right when it got to the top they would have made a fortune many times what their option was worth   since they are style though they would have to wait till their option was redeemable right when the vix would be about back to normal   in this case an american style option would be far more valuable especially for something that is difficult to predict like the vix

like have said can i create a paypal account and receive € 200 or a similar amount without adding a bank account credit card or anything but my email address the answer is no you can transfer the money to your paypal account but until you verify it with your personal information with at least a credit card or mostly likely a bank account paypal will hold those funds until otherwise can i then use that money to buy on amazon still without adding anything but my email address if not can i buy gift cards and use those on amazon amazon does not accept paypal

in the income statement that you 've linked to look for the line labeled net income that 's followed by a line labeled preferred dividends which is followed by income available to common extra items and income available to common incl extra items those last two are the ones to look at the key is that these lines reflect income minus dividends paid to preferred stockholders of which there are none here and that 's income that 's available to ordinary shareholders i.e. earnings for the common stock

while the op the health insurance coverage offered through his wife 's employer as a complete rip off one advantage of such coverage is that if set up right by the employer the premiums can be paid for through pre tax dollars instead of post tax dollars on the other hand   health insurance premiums can not be deducted on schedule c by self employed persons so the self employed person has to pay both the employer 's share as well as the employee 's share of social security and medicare taxes on that money health insurance premiums can be deducted on line 29 of form 1040 but only for those months during which the schedule c filer is neither   covered nor eligible to be covered by a subsidized health insurance plan maintained by an employer of the self employed person whose self employment might be a or the self employed person 's spouse in other words just having the plan coverage available through the wife 's employment even though one taking it is sufficient to make a line 29 deduction   so agi is increased health insurance premiums can be deducted on schedule a but only to the extent that they together with other medical costs exceed 10 of agi for many people in good health this means no deduction there either thus when comparing the premiums of health insurance policies one should pay some attention to the tax issues too health insurance   through a spouse 's employment might not be that bad a deal after all

due to the zero percent interest rate on the euro right now you wo n't find any investment giving you 5 which is n't equivalent to gambling   one of the few investment forms which still promises gains without unreasonable risks right now seems to be real estate because real estate prices in german urban areas not so in rural areas are growing a lot recently one reason for that is in fact the low interest rate because it makes it very cheap right now to take a loan and buy a home this increased demand is driving up the prices note that you do n't need to buy a property yourself to invest in real estate 20k in one of the larger cities of germany will get you maybe a cardboard box below a bridge you can invest your money in a real estate fund you then do n't own a specific property you own a tiny fraction of a whole bunch of different properties this spreads out the risk and allows you to invest exactly as much money as you want however most real estate funds do not allow you to sell in the first two years and require that you announce your sale one year in advance so it 's not a very liquid asset   also it is still a risky investment raising real estate prices might hint to a bubble which might burst eventually financial analysts have different opinions about this but fact is when the european central bank starts to take interest again then the demand for real estate property will drop and so will the prices when you are not sure what to do ask your bank for investment advise german banks are usually trustworthy in this regard

interest is a fee that you pay in order to use someone else 's money once you 've made the deal pretty much anything you do that reduces the total interest that you pay does so by reducing the time for which you get to use their money as an extreme example consider a thirty year interest only loan with a balloon payment at the end if you pay it off after fifteen years you pay half as much interest because you had the use of the money for half as long the same thing happens when you make biweekly payments you reduce the total interest that you pay by giving up the use of some of the borrowed money sooner that 's not necessarily bad but it 's also not automatically good

you are either vat registered or you are not vat registered   if you are not vat registered then you are not allowed to charge customers vat and you can not reclaim vat that you are paying you are however allowed to deduct the cost of goods including vat from your expenses so if you buy a computer for £ 1000 + £ 200 vat and you can deduct the computer as an expense to reduce your profits that you pay income tax for then the expense is £ 1,200 and not just £ 1,000   if you are vat registered then you must charge every customer 20 vat business customers do n't mind at all but private customers will be happier if you do n't charge vat because your bills will be a lot lower you take all the vat that you received then subtract all the vat that you paid for business expenses and that you have invoices for and send the remainder to hmrc four times a year the reason that businesses do n't mind paying vat is because they can in turn deduct the vat they pay you from the vat that they received and for every pound they give you they give one pound less to hmrc note that when you have expenses that are deductible from your profits you can now only deduct the cost excluding vat on the other hand the vat you receive does n't count as income and does n't lead to profits that you need to pay income tax for it 's your decision whether you want to be vat registered or not unless your revenue exceeds some limit somewhere between £ 70,000 and £ 80,000 per year where you must register for vat

gt a the base value from infrastructure is derived on a per capita basis it is a fixed cost as opposed to a variable one in other words roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth a tank a missile a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else   a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    gt b as a percentage of income infrastructure is far more valuable to low income individuals than high income individuals a simple example if i have $ 5 m in net worth i can invest it in the stock market and stay home if you do n't have that option you need to go to work and that will likely require roads i wo n't be taking unemployment benefits but you are far more likely to and so on   it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   gt c the activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues these far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure   if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing     gt d society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts estimates vary but typically 85 in other words if i generate $ 10.00 of value as an entrepreneur i will realistically be able to capture only $ 1.50 of that   yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know

its so funny how people complain about the price of food the price of food in the us for the quality is so far and away better than the food you get in other countries outside of large areas in developing countries you ca n't get fresh food at all or if you do its off the back of a truck and the food is full of bugs and looks     the problem with amazon entering the food market is that food is a penny margin business walmart makes but a few cents on food sales this is because the market for food is so large and is nearly perfectly competitive if a tomato seller says i m raising the price of my tomatoes 1c then walmart will simply find another competitor to sell at lower   the only way amazon will be able to break into the market is by doing the two things they are doing now    1 buy a company that brings to market the same shit as everyone else but with a product differentiation organic this way they can front load the already expensive per ticket sales to hide step 2    2 make shopping more convenient with the margins being so low the cost of buying food at amazon at first will be insanely expensive think wholefoods with a surcharge

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

i am guessing that you do n't understand that even a 100 tax bracket does n't actually equal you paying 100 of your profits in taxes this is why the use while having a corporate tax rate only sees less than 20 in an average effective corporate tax rate in the same vein if a company paid taxes on what profits were created within a countries borders that would be a fairly accurate method of calculating every country 's fair percent of revenue from that company and the amount of infrastructure that were utilized by that company within that country 's borders   and it still would n't add up to anywhere near 100 of that company 's net profits

typically mutual funds will report an annualized return it 's probably an average of 8 per year from the date of inception of the fund that at least gives some basis of comparison if you 're looking at funds of different ages they will also often report annualized 1- 3- 5- and year returns which are probably better basis of comparison since they will have experience the same market booms and busts   so yes generally that 8 gets compounded yearly on average at that rate you 'd get your investment doubled in roughly 9 years on average of course past performance ca n't guarantee future results and all that and variation is often significant with returns that high might be 15 one year -2 the next etc hence my emphasis on specifying on average edit based on the fund given in the comments so in your fund the times less than a year 1 mo 3 mo 6 mo 1 yr is the actual relative change that of fund in that time period anything greater is averaged using cagr approach for example the most recent 3 year period probably ending end of last month had a averaged return 2014 2015 and 2016 had individual returns of and thus that total return over that three year period was = 21 return over three years this is the same total growth that would be achieved if each year saw consistent 6.5 growth ^ 3 =   not exactly the but remember we 're looking at a slightly different time window but it 's pretty close and hopefully helps clarify how the calculation is done

you should be aware that the irs considers all gifts of cash or cash equivalents from an employer the partnership in this case to an employee your husband in this case to be wages regardless of what the transfer is called by either party or how it is transferred i 'd strongly recommend that you review irs publications 535 and which are linked in my response to the question that littleadv referred to above i would also recommend speaking with a lawyer as in this case you have knowledge of the income and would not be able to claim an innocent spouse provision if he is convicted of tax evasion fraud good luck

debt collectors are just doing their job as many people want to evade payment by not responding and skipping their debts and they talk tough to force people found to make their obligated payments based on what they can afford and that ’s all i ’m in the uk but i assume the process is similar    before i begin i worked in debt collection and i presume that the debt collection agency have requested details for a source like a college and you have been returned as a possible match as you name is identical to their debtor but with differing date of birth etc college university students are very in nature and addresses are n’t very helpful when they are not current but details of a current address employer to a very similar name would be a possible lead to debtor and the debt collector is simply acting on flawed information which is fairly rare and   cases such as these are resolved when you can simply confirm your date of birth and other details so that they can eliminate you from their chasing activities   whilst you may feel uncomfortable about giving your details you are not the debtor and will have to confirm this the debt collector is only interested in collection of valid debts values and the current letter is most likely a standard letter to get you to act assuming that you are the debtor if you try to ignore this or only partly answer their contact by telling them not to contact your employer etc they will assume that you are the debtor and step up pursuit   by contacting at work by phone in person or by other means and you employer will see you in a bad light i would advise you to write to them a one time only letter confirming details of your home address and insist on correspondence in writing only to that home address in addition you should confirm your full name including full middle names date of birth that you have never attended the college in question   agreed to any such debt in writing and that you are not the correct data subject as the ss number also differs   the letter should also go on to state a range of costs which require payment before you act further ie subsequent letter $ amount attending court $ per cheap and that if they harass you or otherwise affect your standing with your credit reference or employer or anyone else that you take further action and take them to your court and pursue the costs list above and   losses as a result of their actions including pain and suffering speak tough and mean business and act and your message will win through share your details with them once and above all copy your employer in so that they know this is a case of mistaken identity you can add a large heading at the top of the letter of mistaken to prove your point

this is kind of halfway between the stuff i was talking about and halfway to the stuff i do n't want to get into but it raises some very legitimate and relevant points that are kind of separate from the gold standard debate    the big question taking the banks out of it is a two fold one that goes something like this    is it possible to have a modern economy without credit markets and   is it possible to have functional credit markets without some sort of fractional reserve currency   for example let 's say toyota decides to design a new car before they can sell a single unit someone in africa or somewhere has to dig up the minerals to make it someone has to design it tools have to be re worked all that kind of stuff building one car of a new design might cost a billion dollars or wiki    obviously it 's not realistic for toyota to expect the first customer to pay that much they amortize the design and tooling costs over the expected production run or whatever moreover we might say that only companies that have amassed a billion dollars in physical gold from previous sales should be able to do that kind of thing   but there is a relevant question of whether this makes any kind of sense should toyota have to literally ship or of physical gold through middlemen and suppliers to the miner in africa down to the actual guy who digs up the aluminum or whatever in order to make this transaction happen    how would that work without some sort of intermediary promises    i 'm imagining a scenario where toyota sends an armored truck full of gold out to go find half a ton of aluminum the drivers can not rely on any promises or fractional reserve they must only trade the physical gold in their truck for actual aluminum or expenses along the way    this starts to sanity in a modern economy you have to rely on the promises of middle men and suppliers and contractors and so on and the instant you have promises you have fractional reserves because people are getting paid and money is changing hands that has n't been minted yet    it 's not just the of your local supermarket having to trade a bag full of gold for a shipment of lettuce it 's that contracts to purchase would be meaningless because the driver would have had to give a smaller bag of gold to the supplier who gave a smaller bag of gold to the grower and so on moreover the supermarket would have to just wait to see what entrepreneurial driver shows up and what they have    the supermarket obviously can not order a hundred heads of lettuce per week with a promise to pay not unless we also give the supplier permission to order a hundred heads of lettuce a week from the grower and the grower permission to order seed and hire workers sufficient to grow a hundred heads of lettuce a week and the workers permission to set up car payments to get to work and the seed supplier to so on and so on   that sequence of promises is facto a fractional reserve system with or without a central bank people are promising to deliver gold cash whatever that they do n't currently have moreover it is entirely possible in a gold denominated currency for everyone to keep those promises since the gold like any currency just keeps changing hands and cycling through the economy    your example of gold certificates is exactly equivalent to privately arranged contracts promises to produce a certain amount of gold on completion it 's promises all the way down unless we insist on instant cash transactions e.g. literally handing an employee a dollar 's worth of gold every five minutes or whatever if the employee is counting on the good faith of the employer to settle up at the end of the day or week then we have a fractional reserve system whether or not    when you buy an iphone or a laptop someone had to dig up the stuff to make it out of the ground when you buy a cheeseburger someone had to grow wheat and someone else had to raise and kill a cow it 's not a reasonable proposition that they should wait for you to show up with a bag of gold before doing those things in this day and age    we trade in promises and ious sometimes that sometimes but it 's remarkable how well it does work most of the time and how much better it works than the times and places where people had to trade physical goods for physical goods    this is not an argument against a gold backed currency

since you are not paying the full balance off each month you are carrying a balance from month to month that balance is being charged some interest rate x. with a balance transfer the new credit card pays off that balance as a result you now have a balance of the same amount plus any processing charges on the new credit card hence the balance has transferred from the old to the new and you now pay the new credit card ideally you do this because the new credit card is offering a reduced interest rate saving you money though be warned often that transfer rate is a limited time deal and any left over after the window expires will be charged the higher rate

ca n't totally agree with that volatility trading is just one trading type of many in my opinion it does n't depend on whether you are a professional trader or not   as you might have heard retail traders are said to create noise on the market mainly due to the fact that they are n't professional in their majority so i would assume if an average retail trader decided to trade volatility he would create as much noise as if would have been betting on stock directions basically most types of trading would require a considerable amount of effort spent on fundamental analysis of the underlying be it volatility or directional trading arbitrage trading would be an exception here i guess however volatility trading relies more on trader 's subjective expectations about future deviations whereas trading stock directions requires deeper research of the underlying is it a drawback or an advantage on the other hand side volatility trading strategies cover both upward and downward movements but you can set similar hedging strategies when going short or long on stocks is n't it to i think it is a matter of preference imagine yourself going long on s&p500 since 2009 do you think there are many volatility traders who have outperformed that

the most important thing to remember is that being vat registered you must add vat to every bill so every bill will be 20 higher if the bill payer is a company they do n't care because they deduct the 20 vat from their own vat bill if the bill payer is a private person their cost of your services has just gone up by 20 and it is going to hurt your business so the question is what kind of customers do you have   but if your customers are companies then the flat rate scheme mentioned above is very little work and puts a nice little amount of extra cash in your pocket suitable if your bills are mostly for your work and not for parts that you buy for the customer and bill them for

i will disagree with the other answers the idea that there is some to establish a credit history is largely a myth by who see it as positive propaganda to increase the numbers of their prospective customers you will find some people who claim they were rejected for a card because they had no credit history but in every case what these people are not telling you is they also had no income were students house wives or others with no steady income anyone who has income can get a credit card or other line of credit regardless of their credit history even people who have gone bankrupt can get credit cards if they have proven income if your answer to this is that you have no income but still want a credit card i would advise you to re read that sentence several times and think carefully about it i have never had a credit card and never missed having one except when trying to rent cars which was somewhat complex and annoying to do in the 2005 2010 time period without a credit card credit cards have a number of disadvantages i definitely agree with those who will tell you credit cards are convenient they are but for someone who wants to be financially prudent and build wealth they are unnecessary and unwise if you do n't believe me read the total money makeover by david ramsey one of the most famous and best selling books ever written on personal finance he actually will give you much better and detailed reasons to avoid ccs than me after all who am i just some dumb rich schmuck with lots of money and no debt and a happy life comment on culture i think it is pretty funny we have a lot of americans in this thread basically telling the op to get lots of credit cards as soon as possible if you asked the same question in japan you would get completely different answers and votes in japan its hard to even use credit cards the   people there are much more responsible financially than americans the average japanese person has much higher wealth than a person with the same income in the united states one of the reasons for this among many is that the average japanese person does not use credit cards a japanese person if you translated this question for them would think the whole thing a typical example of how foolish americans are

it depends on the bank according to the uniform commercial code a bank is not obliged to pay a cheque after six months but may do so if it wants to 4 404   bank not obliged to pay check more than six months old a bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check other than a certified check which is presented more than six months after its date but it may charge its customer 's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith official link to 4 404 as for your second question if you stamp void after 60 days on your cheque i do n't have a specific answer for that part yet update i can find no specific rules about someone putting an arbitrary void after xxx days on their personal check are to but again the overriding rule seems to be that after six months it 's the bank 's choice and you certainly could n't make a cheque expire before six months so i do n't think that putting a stamp would make any difference it 's still up to the bank in the end

compound growth is n't a myth it just takes patience to experience   a 10 annual return will double the investment not in 10 years but just over 7   even though a mortgage claims to use simple interest if your loan is 5 and there 's 14 years to go $ 100 extra principal will knock off $ 200 from the final payment the same laws of compounding and rule of 72 are at play

this is an opinion but i think it has more to do with the market 's uncertainty about the long term future of the company without steve jobs   apple has n't released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since jobs passed and while some people would argue about the apple watch jobs played a significant role in its development prior to his death so that does n't really count whether you like or hate apple you had to admire jobs passion and creativity and there 's real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the jobs vision over the long haul   my guess is that the market is leaning slightly toward the no column but only ever so slightly   the company continues to deliver fantastic results but how long will that last of their next products do n't wow consumers the way previous ones have   this skepticism manifests itself in a stock that trades at a lower p e than it deserves to but this is just my opinion    i hope this helps good luck

look at a mixture of low fee index funds low fee bond funds and cds the exact allocation has to be tailored to your appetite for risk if you only want to park the money with essentially no risk of loss then you need fdic insured products like cds or a money market account as opposed to a money market fund which is not fdic insured however as others have said interest rates are awful now   since you are in your early 30 's and expect to keep this investment for 10 + years you can probably tolerate a bit of risk also considering speaking to a tax professional to determine the specific tax benefits drawbacks of one investment strategy funds and cds versus another e.g. real estate

material information means that any information that can reasonable affect the share price of the company upward or downward as looked by the investors the idea is to provide a level playing field to all investors hence it forces people having material information not to trade when they have this information that is not yet disclosed yes it happens all the time and laws are quite stringent there is monitoring of share activity by regulators hence most of the times the companies come out with their own guidelines and top senior management is prohibited from trading in their own company ’s shares for pretty much round the year except few windows the company decides is safe now it may not be possible to monitor every small material info but any large spike of stocks after certain announcements is investigated by regulators to verify any undue gains for ex a person who never trades suddenly buys large qty of shares and it goes up and he sells again etc

sure it 's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate   but what about or inaction   put it another way   is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate   think about it what a silly idea    consider a apartment building full of rent paying tenants   a tenant gives notice and leaves   so do 4 more   with only tenants the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit   is that acceptable   heck no   realistically this will be managed by a property management company and of course they 'll seek new tenants not stopping merely because the owner died   this situation is not different the same fiscal logic applies   the counter argument is usually along the lines of stuff might happen if you rent it out true but the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse and much more likely teen urban explorers pot growers copper thieves winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors etc   do n't take my word on it ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs. a rented one   renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants $ on a $ 1000/mo rental and that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates   but on an old mortgage renting is like printing money   that money first to the estate presumably it is holding back a fix the roof emergency fund and then to the beneficiaries   it means getting annual checks from the estate instead of constantly being for another repair   but i do n't care about making revenue outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof   even if it was net zero it means the maintenance is being done   this being the point   it is keeping the house in good repair occupied insured and professionally managed fit and ready for the bequest 's purpose occupancy of an aunt   what 's the alternative   move an aunt into a house that 's been 10 years abandoned   realistically the heirs are going to get tired bored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss maintenance will slip and you 'll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues   that the bequest and it 's not fair to the rental is a very responsible thing to do   the executor should n't fail to do it merely out of   if you decide not to do it there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the home 's decent upkeep   i do n't think there is one   excluding a revenue producing asset from the economy is an expensive thing to do

behind the scenes mutual funds and etfs are very similar   both can vary widely in purpose and policies which is why understanding the prospectus before investing is so important since both mutual funds and etfs cover a wide range of choices any discussion of management assets or expenses when discussing the differences between the two is inaccurate   mutual funds and etfs can both be either managed or index based   high expense or low expense stock or commodity backed method of investing when you invest in a mutual fund you typically set up an account with the mutual fund company and send your money directly to them   there is often a minimum initial investment required to open your mutual fund account   mutual funds sometimes but not always have a load which is a fee that you pay either when you put money in or take money out an etf is a mutual fund that is traded like a stock   to invest you need a brokerage account that can buy and sell stocks   when you invest you pay a transaction fee just as you would if you purchase a stock   there is n't really a minimum investment required as there is with a traditional mutual fund but you usually need to purchase whole shares of the etf   there is inherently no load with etfs tax treatment mutual funds and etfs are usually taxed the same   however capital gain distributions which are taxable events that occur while you are holding the investment are more common with mutual funds than they are with etfs due to the way that etfs are structured   see fidelity etf versus mutual funds tax efficiency for more details   that having been said in an index fund capital gain distributions are rare anyway due to the low turnover of the fund conclusion when comparing a mutual fund and etf with similar objectives and expenses and deciding which to choose it more often comes down to convenience   if you already have a brokerage account and you are planning on making a one time investment an etf could be more convenient   if on the other hand you have more than the minimum initial investment required and you also plan on making additional regular monthly investments a traditional no load mutual fund account could be more convenient and less expensive

limiting liability to your investment is one of the main points of corporations when you contract with a corporation you know that all you can get if the corporation defaults is the assets owned by the corporation not the owners of said corp there are plenty of covenants can put in place to restrain management from making decisions that can be detrimental to said     gt;so here is a case of a legitimate lawsuit it was heard in court and rich dad was ordered to pay $ 24 million to his former   it seems that the corporation was ordered to pay no the man does not claim he ca n't pay it he claims the corporate entity that is supposed to pay it ca n't pay it i do n't think the opposing side ever had an agreement with kiyosaki on a personal level   this man probably runs several businesses there is a chance some may go under it is a legitimate tactic to insulate each business from one another the know this ahead of time and receive extra yield on their investment for taking these easily identifiable risks if you do n't want to invest with someone who does n't have skin in the game all you have to do is do n't invest

your question is best asked of a tax expert not random people on the internet such an expert will help you ask the right questions   for example you did not point out the country or state in which you live   that matters    first point is that you will not pay tax on 60 k its expensive to transact real estate so your net proceeds will be closer to   also you can probably the deduct the costs of improvements you implied that you really like this rental property   if that is the case why would you sell ever   this home could be a central part of your financial independence plan   so keep it until you die   iirc when it passes to your heirs a new cost basis is formed thereby not passing the tax burden onto them assuming the property is located in the us

if you have significant assets such as a large deposit then diversification of risks such as currency risk is good practice there are many good options but keeping 100 of it in is definitely not a good idea nor is keeping 100 of it in a single foreign currency   of course it would be much more beneficial to have done it yesterday and moments of extreme volatility generally are a bad time to make large uninformed trades but if the deposit is sufficiently large say equal to annual expenses then it would make sense to split it among different currencies and also different types of assets as well deposit stocks precious metals bonds the rate of rouble may go up and down but you also have to keep in mind that future events such as fluctuating oil price may risk a much deeper crisis than now and you can look to experiences of the 1998 crisis as an example of what may happen if the situation continues to deteriorate

surprisingly accurate are you in the industry i usually see wildly incorrect info about processing online i work in processing   only part not quite correct    gt;at the end of the day week whatever the processor collects money from the issuing financial institution and is responsible for giving the right amount less fees to the merchant   the acquiring bank processor actually fronts money to the merchant typically within 1 2 days the issuing bank later reimburses the acquiring bank processor less interchange fees the processor then deducts the interchange fee amount and their markup from the merchant 's account making themselves whole from the original money fronting and getting their profit   that 's why there 's risk to processors when it comes to chargebacks if a transaction is fraudulent the issuing bank is n't going to give them money for it but they 've already given money to the merchant so they need to be able to recoup it from the merchant or they 'll be out that money   but yeah definitely a service and it 's odd that people often argue that it is n't

so you are off to a really good start   congratulations on being debt free and having a nice income being an it contractor can be financially rewarding but also have some risks to it much like investing   with your disposable income i would not shy away from investing in further training through sites like or to improve weak skills   they are not terribly expensive for a person in your situation   if you were loaded down with debt and payments the story would be different having an emergency fund will help you be a good it contractor as it adds stability to your life   i would keep   £ 10 k or so in a boring savings account   think of it not as an investment but as insurance against life 's woes   having such a fund allows you to go after a high paying job you might fail at or invest with impunity    i would encourage you to take an intermediary step   moving out on your own   i would encourage renting before buying even if it is just a room in someone else 's home   i would try to be out of the house in less than 3 months   being on your own helps you mature in ways that can only be accomplished by being on your own   it will also reduce the culture shock of buying your own home or entering into an adult relationship i would put a minimum of £ 300/month in growth stock mutual funds   keeping this around 15 of your income is a good metric   if available you may want to put this in tax favored retirement accounts   sorry but i am woefully ignorant of uk retirement savings   this becomes your retire at 60 fund   starting now you can retire well before 68   for now stick to an index fund and once it gets to 25 k you may want to look to diversify for the rest of your disposable income i 'd invest in something safe and secure   the amount of your disposable income will change presumably as you will have additional expenses for rent and food   this will become your buy a house fund   this is something that should be safe and secure   something like a bond fund money market dividend producing stocks or preferred stocks    i am currently doing something like this and have 50 in a savings account 25 in a blue chip index fund and 25 in a preferred stock fund   this way you have some decent stability of principle while also having some ability to grow    once you have that built up to about 12 k and you feel comfortable you can start shopping for a house   you may want to be at the high end of your area so you should try and save at least 10 or you may want to be really weird and save the whole thing and buy your house for cash   if you are still single you may want to rent a room or two so your home can generate income    here in the us there can be other ways to generate income from your property   one example is a home that has a separate area and room to park a boat   a boat owner will pay some decent money to have a place to park their boat and there is very little impact to the owner   be creative and perhaps find a way where a potential property could also produce income good luck check back in with progress and further questions edit   after some reading isa seem like a really good deal

prediction costs wo n't go down     the basis for that is the cost of insurance for health has never gone down in the history of that product mainly due to the fixed market   there is competition but pricing is so rigged as health insurance companies and employers have completely removed pricing from consumers experience     until everyone has individual independent insurance away from their jobs healthcare costs will never be in check when employers gtfo of your business and stop providing benefits and people have to buy their own insurance that is the only time there will be any real market or real pricing in healthcare medical

gt;when i was a student back in the early nineties i had a holiday job at the frozen food supermarket chain iceland   one morning presumably fresh from a leadership course at hq our manager called all the staff together to us for our apparent lack of enthusiasm for the sale of turkey nuggets   sometimes i feel that some of you are only in this for the   money she   she was cut off by   after all what other motivation could there be for spending one ’s weekend a giant fridge freezer   this is ironically hilarious     after all what exactly is the underlying motivation of the company itself   the good of all little children of the world hence the of turkey nuggets for free   oh wait the goal is to make money   derp       as this may sound it ’s a cultural shift that favours the employer over the worker   for as long as companies are able to offer their staff these intangible psychological carrots they are able to get away with not paying them in full for the work they do gt gt gt gt;for companies it ’s a perfect   like faith the more they can fire up in their staff the more they can squeeze out of them and the less they ask in return    i heard this kind of bs along with the soviet style banners and mission statements and 5 year plans well over a decade ago   my response then to it from a friend ceo who was trying to entice me into working for his company and tried this because he 'd recently been indoctrinated into the bs via harvard 's mba program was simple i said sorry guy cut the bs i 'm basically my mind skills time amp labor make me a better offer in terms of $ $ or stfu he started to take at the concept and i replied that i was n't born yesterday i knew that he had inherited the company that he himself really did n't give a rats arse about making amp selling the products that he did and that the whole enterprise was as essentially all enterprises are all about making money so if he wanted me on his team he would need to pay and besides his entire reason for wanting to hire me was that he knew i would be able to help make his operation significantly more efficient and therefore more profitable   sometimes you just need to clock these over the head with a baseball bat they get so caught up and in using the buzzwords and that they themselves into thinking that they really are doing god 's work the irony is that those same delusions and buzzwords tend to make them easy marks for scamming con men consultants something that i have seen happen several times often almost hilariously   and i also see that this is the influence of creeping socialism as if there is something inherently wrong with making a profit and it has to be justified with something more noble which is total delusional the only reason to plant a seed is to reap the harvest and thus feed yourself and incidentally others from whom you are entitled to expect something in return exchange

no that 's pretty unlikely card issuers typically base your rate on your credit score paying down debt reduces your percent of available credit used and improves your score until you are in the 1 20 range that 's optimum to this issuer you are one of a million customers there 's no emotion in this just numbers to them for what it 's worth if a card issuer raises your rate you are permitted to not accept the rate stop using the card for new charges and pay at the current rate of course this does n't apply to zero interest deals only to increases to your regular rate

yahoo 's adj close data is adjusted for splits but not for dividends despite yahoo 's webpage 's footnote saying   close price adjusted for dividends and splits we can see empirically that the adj close is only adjusted for splits for example consider siemens from jan 27 2017 to mar 15 2017 the adj close adjusts for splits on any particular day the adj close is equal to the close price divided by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day if there have been no splits after that day then the adj close equals the close price since there is a 2-for-1 split on mar 14 2017 the adj close is half the close price for all dates from jan 27 2017 to mar 13 2017 note that if siemens were to split again at some time in the future the adj close prices will be for this future split for example if siemens were to split tomorrow then all the adj close prices seen above will be divided by 3 the adj close is thus showing the price that a share would have traded on that day if the shares had already been split in accordance with all splits up to today the adj close does not adjust for dividends notice that siemens distributed a $ dividend on feb 02 2017 and dividend on jan 30 2017 if the adj close value were adjusted for these dividends then we should expect the adj close should no longer be exactly half of the close amount but we can see that there is no such adjustment the adj close remains up to rounding exactly half the close amount note that in theory the market reacts to the distribution of dividends by reducing the trading price of shares post dividend this in turn is reflected in the raw closing price so in that sense the adj close is also automatically adjusted for dividends but there is no formula for this the effect is already baked in through the market 's closing prices

it is a dangerous policy not to have a balance across the terms of assets short term reserves should remain in short term investments because they are most likely needed in the short term   the amount can be shaved according to the probability of their respective needs but long term asset variance usually exceed the probability of needing to use reserves for example replacing one month bonds paying essentially nothing with stocks that should be expected to return 9 will expose oneself to a possible sudden 50 loss   if cash is indeed so abundant that reserves can be doubled this policy can be expected to be stable however cash is normally scarce   it is a risky policy to place reserves that have a 20 chance of being 100 liquidated into investments that have a 20 chance of declining by approximately 50 just for a chance of an extra 9 annual return financial stability should always be of primary concern with rate of return secondary only after stability has been reasonably assured

there are of course many possible financial emergencies they range from large medical expenses to losing your job to being sued to major home or car repairs to who knows what i suppose some people are in a position where the chances that they will face any sort of financial emergency are remote if you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs you ride the bus or subway and do n't own a car so that 's not an issue etc etc maybe there just is n't any likely scenario where you 'd suddenly need cash i can think of all sorts of scenarios that might affect me i 'm trying to put my kids through college so if i lost my job even if unemployment benefits were adequate to live on they would n't pay for college i have terrible health insurance so big medical bills could cost me a lot i have an old car so it could break down any time and need expensive repairs or even have to be replaced i might suddenly be charged with a crime that i did n't commit and need a lawyer to defend me etc so in a very real sense everyone 's situation is different on the other hand no matter how carefully you think it out it 's always possible that you will get bitten by something that you did n't think of by definition you ca n't make a list of unforeseen problems that might affect you so no matter how safe you think you are it 's always good to have some emergency fund just in case how much is very hard to say

form w-9 officially the request for taxpayer identification number and certification is used in the united states income tax system by a third party who must file an information return with the internal revenue service irs it requests the name address and taxpayer identification information of a taxpayer in the form of a social security number or employer identification number a w-9 is typically required when an individual is doing work as a contractor or as an employee for a company and will be paid more than $ 600 in a tax year   the company is required to file a w-2 or a 1099 and so requests a w-9 to get the information necessary for those forms i can not say if it is incompetence on the part of the accounting department or a deliberate ploy to make the refund process more onerous but do not comply   politely on a refund without any further information   if the company refuses request a charge back from the credit card company file a complaint with the consumer protection department of the state where the company is located and write a bad review on yelp or wherever else seems appropriate

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

as others have said this opinion is predicated on an assumption that early in your life you have no need to actually use the money so you are able to take advantage of compounding interest because the money is going to be there for many many years and you are far more tolerant of loss because you can simply wait for the markets to recover this is absolutely true of a pension pot which is locked away for a great many years but it is absolutely not true of general investments someone in the to is very likely to want to spend that money on say buying a house in which case losing 10 of your deposit 3 months before you start looking for a house could potentially be a disaster in your if your child 's school college fund goes up in smoke that 's a big deal it is a very commonly espoused theory but i think it is also fundamentally flawed in many scenarios

the common advice you mentioned is just a guideline and has little to do with how your portfolio would look like when you construct it in order to diversify you would be using correlations and some common sense recall the recent global financial crisis ones of the first to crash were aaa rated cdo 's stocks and so on because correlation is a statistical measure this can work fine when the economy is stable but it does n't account for real life especially when population is affected once consumers are affected this spans to the entire economy so that sectors that previously seemed unrelated have now been tied together by the fall in demand or reduced ability to pay off i always find it funny how us advisers tell you to hold 80 of us stocks and bonds while uk ones tell you to stick to the uk securities the same happens all over the world i would assume the safest portfolio is a global market portfolio obviously i would n't be getting say bonds if such exist at all but there are plenty of markets to choose from a chance of all of them crashing simultaneously is significantly lower why do n't people include derivatives in their portfolios could be because these are mainly short term while most of the portfolios are being held for a significant amount of time thus capital and money markets are the key components derivatives are used to hedge these portfolios as for the currencies by having foreign stocks and bonds you are already exposed to fx risk so you again could be using it as a hedging instrument

you have several issues at work if in the next few years you have a leak in the roof that causes another insurance claim they may decide not to cover it because they already paid you to replace the roof and it is your fault that it was n't that might also mean they do n't pay you for the stuff that is damaged because of the new leak if you minimize the claim that may make it less likely that they will drop you in the future or increase you rate next year but if you do n't return the excess funds they will evaluate you on the larger claim size of course if they are sending the money directly to the repair company they will only pay the bill up to a maximum amount usually the issue has been that the repair company wants to do a larger repair the dispute resolves around some aspect of the building code i had a car repair that had to be increased because the roof damage was within x inches of the windshield so the windshield had to be replaced the insurance company eventually agreed but it slowed down the process for a couple of days because they wanted to measure it it is possible that the insurance company has rules related to the age of the roof and the amount of damage that triggers a total replacement

is this legal why not but you might have trouble deducting losses on your taxes especially if you sell to someone related to you in some way which is indeed what you 're doing see the added portion below regarding dealing with related person which a sibling is the state of maryland has a transfer tax of 1.5 for each the buyer and seller would this be computed on the appraised or sale value you should check with the state in california property taxes are assessed based on sale value but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate since you 're selling to family the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to fair market value on the transaction but again check the local law will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing likely banks will be suspicious since you 're giving a discount to your sibling it will likely not cause a problem for financing if it was an unrelated person getting such a discount it would likely to have raised some questions would i be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return as i said it may be a problem if the transaction is between related people likely not otherwise not sure check with a professional tax adviser ea or cpa licensed in maryland you mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling irs publication has a list of what is considered related person and that includes siblings so the short answer is no you will not be able to deduct the loss the tax treatment is not trivial in this case and i suggest to have a professional tax adviser guide you on how to proceed here 's the definition of related person from the irs pub members of a family including only brothers sisters half brothers half sisters spouse ancestors parents grandparents    etc and lineal descendants children grandchildren etc an individual and a corporation if the individual directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the    corporation two corporations that are members of the same controlled group as defined in section of the internal revenue code a trust fiduciary and a corporation if the trust or the grantor of the trust directly or indirectly owns more than 50 in value of the    outstanding stock of the corporation a grantor and fiduciary and the fiduciary and beneficiary of any trust fiduciaries of two different trusts and the fiduciary and beneficiary of two different trusts if the same person is the grantor    of both trusts a tax exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls the organization or a member of    that person 's family a corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than    50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the partnership two s corporations if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation two corporations one of which is an s corporation if the same persons own more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of each    corporation an executor and a beneficiary of an estate unless the sale or exchange is in satisfaction of a bequest two partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own more than 50 of the capital interests or profits interests in both    partnerships a person and a partnership if the person directly or indirectly owns more than 50 of the capital interest or profits interest in the    partnership

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

tl;dr the cnn money and yahoo finance charts are wildly inaccurate the td ameritrade chart appears to be accurate and shows returns with reinvested dividends ignoring buggy data cnn most likely shows reinvested dividends for quoted securities but not for the s&p 500 index yahoo most likely shows all returns without reinvested dividends thanks to a tip from grade eh bacon i was able to determine that td ameritrade reports returns with reinvested dividends as it claims to do the chart it appears that s&p 500 grew by over the five year period the chart covers meanwhile according to this s&p 500 return estimator the five year return of s&p 500 with reinvested dividends was between july 2012 to july 2017 vs. raw returns i have no idea what numbers cnn money is working from because it claims s&p 500 only grew about 35 over the last five years which is less than half of the raw return ditto for yahoo which claims 45 growth even stranger still the cnn chart for vfinx an s&p 500 index fund clearly shows the correct market growth without reinvesting dividends from the s&p 500 index so whatever problem exists is inconsistent   yahoo also agrees with itself for vfinx but comes in a bit low even if your assume no reinvestment of dividends 68 vs. 78 expected i 'm not sure if it 's ever right   by way of comparison td 's chart for vfinx seems to be consistent with its chart and with reality   as a final sanity check i pulled historical prices from yahoo finance it closed at $ on 27 aug 2012 and $ on 28 aug 2017 or growth overall that agrees with td and the return calculator above and disagrees with cnn money on worse yahoo 's own charts both and vfinx disagree with yahoo 's own historical data

does he need to file a tax return in this situation will the irs be concerned that he did not file even if he received a 1099 no however if you do n't file the irs may come back asking why or make up a return for you assuming that the whole amount on the 1099-misc is your net earnings so in the end i suspect you 'll end up filing even though you do n't have to just to prove that you do n't have to bottom line if you have 1099 income or any other income reported to the irs that brings you over the filing threshold file a return

it would seem to be in your best interest to file and that probably means that you should do all you can to get your documents back   if you are in fact owed a refund then there is apparently no penalty to filing late   if you instead owe taxes you better file in any case since the fees stack up pretty fast 5 per month after the due date up to 25 of the taxes owed

no there are no issues   when you form the corp in de you pick a business there to serve as your agent essentially someone who knows to get in contact with you   the agent will notify you about taxes and any mail you get but besides the fee they charge you for being the agent you should file all the taxes directly with de franchise tax is easy to file on the web instead of going through the agent and paying a surcharge when your llc files taxes you 'll do so in de and then the llc will issue you a federal and state k1   you 'll file taxes where you reside and use the federal k1 but i think you might have to file de state taxes unsure about this part feel free to edit or comment and i 'll correct

i 'm afraid you 're mistaking 401k as an investment vehicle it 's not it is a vehicle for retirement roth 401k ira has the benefit of tax free distributions at retirement and as long as you 're in the low tax bracket it is for your benefit to take advantage of that however that is not the money you would be using to start a business or buy a home except for maybe up to $ 10 k you can withdraw without penalty for first time home buyers but i would n't bother with $ 10k if that 's what will help you buying a house maybe you should n't be buying at all in addition you should make sure you take advantage of the employer 401k match in full that is free money added to your traditional 401k retirement savings taxed at distribution once you took the full advantage of the employer 's match and contributed as much as you consider necessary for your retirement above that there are various retirement calculators on line that can help you in making that determination everything else will probably go to taxable regular savings investments

the whole point of a credit report and by extension a credit score is to demonstrate and judge your ability to repay borrowed funds   everything stems from that goal available credit payment history collections etc all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue revolving credit balances are tricky because they are more complicated than fixed loans for the rest of this answer i 'll just talk about credit cards though it also applies to lines of credit such as overdraft protection for checking accounts helocs and other such products having a large available balance relative to your income means that at any time you could suddenly drown yourself in debt   having no credit cards means you do n't have experience managing them and personal finances are governed largely by behavior meaning experience is invaluable   having credit cards but carrying a high balance means you know how to borrow money but not pay it back   having credit cards but carrying no balance means you do n't know how to borrow money or you do n't trust yourself to pay it back ideally lenders will see a pattern of you borrowing a portion of the available credit and then paying it down   generally that means utilizing up to 30 of your available credit   even if you maintain the balance in that range without paying it off completely it at least shows that you have restraint and are able to stop spending at a limit you personally set rather than the limit the bank sets for you so to answer your question 0 balance on your credit cards is bad because you might as well not have them   use it pay it off rinse and repeat and it will demonstrate your ability to exercise self control as well as your ability to repay your debts

gt they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems   interest is likely quoted annually so it 's not 12 for 2 years but 12 for each year invested   gt that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong   extremely unlikely it 's inefficient and furthermore illogical and system breaking under that money just sits around wasting away from inflation as opposed to being invested what is much more likely is immediate or close to immediate investment    admin costs can be accounted for several ways but rest assured are almost certainly drawn out in relatively even payments at a set interval

generally speaking having more institutional investors is a good sign of course there are many types of institutions   normally we are thinking of mutual funds pension funds endowments and hedge funds   they may not all have the same implications   hedge funds in particular are out to make a buck with very little restriction on how they do it   they may buy an undervalued stock and then use their voting power to improve the company or they may do something more questionable like pump up the stock price and then sell at the high causing volatility   the people you are referring to may be thinking of something like the latter those concerns are generally small when compared with the known positives of institutional ownership

there are a number of ways you could do this the first step is to work out what a fair price is either make an estimate that you both accept possibly getting a real estate agent to give you a free evaluation or get a professional evaluation from some you both accept once you have a valuation the simplest of course is to pay your brother that value in return for his transferring his ownership to you hopefully you have that much money in savings if you do n't have that money but do have income you may need to take a mortgage which would put your home at risk if the pollution you speak of has n't been fixed a mortgage may be out of the question an alternative if you have income and your brother does n't need the money right now is to make the money you owe him for the house a loan from him to you he transfers his ownership of the house to you you pay him its value but he simultaneously loans you that exact same amount no actual money needs to change hands you would make him a regular payment essentially the interest on that loan and also make an agreement to pay off the principal of the loan i.e. the value of the house when the house is sold or when you pass away while you could do this informally if everyone agrees it would be much better to make a legal agreement so that everybody is exactly sure what they are expecting

so with any debt be it a loan or a bond or anything else you have two parts the principal and the interest the interest payment is calculated by applying the interest to the principal most bonds are bullet bonds which means that the principle remains completely outstanding for the life of the bond and thus your interest payments are constant throughout the life of the bond usually paid semi annually typically part of the purpose of these is to be indefinitely refinanced so you never really pay the principal back though it is theoretically due at expiration   what you are thinking of when you say a loan from a bank is an amortizing loan with these you pay an increasing amount of the principal each period calculated such that your payments are all exactly the same including the final payment   bonds just like bank loans can be bullet partially amortizing you pay some of the principle but still have a smaller lump sum at the end and fully amortizing one really common bullet structure is 5 non call 3 which means you are n't allowed to pay the principle down for the first three years even if you want to this is to protect investors who spend time and resources investing in you

so if i understand your plan right this will be your situation after the house is bought total debt here 's what i would do wait until your house sells before buying a new one   that way you can take the equity from that sale and apply it towards the down payment rather than taking a loan on your retirement account    if something happens and your house does n't sell for as as you think it will you 'll lose out on the gains from the amount you borrow which will more than offset the interest you are paying yourself at worst pay off the 401(k loan the instant your sale closes take as much of the remaining equity as you can and start paying down student loans   there are several reasons why they are a higher priority than a mortgage some are mathematical some are not should i look to pay off student loans sooner even if i refi at a lower rate of 3.5 or so or the mortgage earlier    my thoughts are that the student loans follow me for life but i can always sell and buy another home so you want this baggage for the rest of your life   how will it be when you get that off your back   how much investing are you missing out on because of student loan payments   what happens if you get lose your license   what if you become disabled   student loans are not but you can always sell the asset behind a mortgage or car loan   they are worse than credit card debt in that sense   you have no tangible asset behind it and no option for forgiveness unless you decide to practice in a high need area but i do n't get the sense that that 's your path the difference in interest is generally only a few payment worth over 15 years is the interest amortized the same as a 15 year if i pay a 30 year mortgage in 15 years   yes however the temptation to just pay it off over 30 years is still there   how often will you decide that a bigger car payment or a vacation or something else is more important   with a 15-year note you lock in a plan and stick to it some other options
