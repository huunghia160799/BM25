no any gifts you receive are not taxable to you in fact losing money in a scam as this sure sounds like to me can even be tax deductible if you lose enough i would n't recommend accepting anything usually people with millions are dollars are capable of setting up their own bank accounts

you can set up a self managed super fund smsf and use it to buy residential investment property and as justin has mentioned even borrow to acquire the investment property through the smsf   however you can not hold your home in the smsf as this would be classed as an in house asset and you are only allowed to hold a maximum of 5 of the total market value of smsf as in house assets furthermore as you already own your house you are not allowed to transfer residential property into a smsf from a related party even if done at current market value you are allowed to transfer business real property from a related party at current market value regarding loans you are not allowed to lend money from your smsf to a related party as well

they are basically asking for the name of the legal entity that they should write on the check you as a person are a legal entity and so you can have them pay you directly by name this is in effect a sole proprietorship arrangement and it is the situation of most independent contractors you 're working for yourself and you get all the money but you also have all the responsibility you can also set up a legal alias or a doing business as dba name the only thing that changes versus using your own name is well that you are n't using your own name to be honest you pay some trivial fee for the paperwork to the county clerk or other office of record and you 're now not only john doe you 're enterprises and your business checks can be written out to that name and the bank who will want a copy of the dba paperwork to file when you set the name up as a payable entity on the account will cash them for you an llc since it was mentioned is a limited liability company it is a legal entity that is your in the business world it not you is the entity that primarily faces anyone else in that world you become for legal purposes an agent of that company authorized to make decisions on its behalf you can do all the same things make all the same money but if things go pear shaped the company is the one liable not you sounds great right well there 's a downside and that 's taxes and the increased complexity thereof depending on the exact structure of the company the irs will treat the llc either as a corporation a partnership or as a disregarded entity most one man llcs are typically disregarded meaning that for tax purposes all the money the company makes is treated as if it were made by you as a sole proprietor as in the above cases and with the associated increased fica and lack of tax deductions that an employee would get nothing can be retained by the company because as far as the irs is concerned it does n't exist so whether the money from the profits of the company actually made it into your personal checking account or not it has to be reported by you on the schedule c. you can elect if you wish to have the llc treated as a corporation this allows the corporation to retain earnings and thus to own liquid assets like cash as opposed to only fixed assets like land cars etc it also allows you to be an employee of your own company and pay yourself a true salary with all the applicable tax rules including pre tax healthcare employer paid fica etc however the downside here is that some money is subject to double taxation any monies retained by the company or paid out to members as dividends is profit of the company for which the company is taxed at the corporate rate then the money from that dividend you receive from the company is taxed again at the capital gains rate on your own 1040 return this also means that you have to file taxes twice once for the corporation once for you as the individual you ca n't of course have it both ways with an llc you ca n't pay yourself a true salary and get the associated tax breaks then receive leftover profits as a distribution and avoid double taxation it takes multiple members owners to have the llc treated like a partnership and there are specific types of llcs set up to handle investments where some of what i 've said above does n't apply i wo n't get into that because the question inferred a single owner situation but the tax rules in these additional situations are again different

if upper and bollinger bands either converge both bands are getting more and more close together or diverge both bands are getting more and more away from each other does that mean the market is trending the answer is no the divergence or convergence of bb upper lower band does not indicate if the market is trending or not it only indicated if volatility is increasing or decreasing or is market trending only in case if both bands upper and lower are parallel and at the same time not horizontal the answer is yes to understand the reason consider that bb is constructed from a central moving average along with standard deviation upper band = lower band = a moving average is a trend following indicator and volatility has nothing to do with trend as sd only measures the price movement around the mean which essentially means bb has trend following qualities the upper and lower bands remain more or less parallel in between band contraction and expansion refer below    you shall see distinctly phases when bb bands are not parallel and are parallel and not horizontal as mentioned above when bb bands are expanding or contracting they do not give indication of the trend direction when they are parallel close or apart and not horizontal they provide a good directional bias through the general slope though a more effective method to determine trend and its direction is the central ma of bb again refer below   here you can see that some portion of the bands are parallel and more or less horizontal the price action would tell you that the stock is now range bound as opposed to trending the primary use of the bb bands are to gauge volatility as stated the primary trend direction is usually derived from the central ma

the risk in a divident paying stock can come from 2 sources the business of the company or the valuation of the stock at the time you buy   the business of the company relates to how they are running things the risks they are taking with the company innovations in their pipeline and their competitive landscape you can find all sorts of examples of companies that paid nice dividends but did n't end so well kodak enron lehman brothers all used to pay very nice dividends at some point   on the other hand you have the valuation the company is running great but the market has unrealistic expectations about it think amazon and yahoo back in 2001 the price was way too high for the company 's worth as the price of a stock goes up the return that you get from its future cash flows dividends goes down and   if you want to go deep into the subject check out this course from chicago u they spend a lot of time talking about dividends future returns from stocks and the risk rewards of finding stocks by methods such as these

this link does it ok   basically you calculate percentage return by doing stock price now stock price before   you 're not calculating the rate of return hence no subtraction of 100   the standard is to do this on a daily basis stock price today stock price yesterday the most important and most misunderstood part is that you now have to analyze the data geometrically not   to easily do this convert all percentage returns with the natural log next you take the standard deviation of all of those results and apply exp   this answers the title of your question for convenience 's sake it 's best to annualize since volatility implied or statistical is now almost always quoted annualized   there are trading days each year   you multiply your result by 240 of trading days per return ^ 0.5 so if you 're doing this for daily returns multiply the result by 240 ^ 0.5 if you were doing it weekly you 'd want to multiply by 240 etc   this is your number for sigma   this answers the intent of your question for black scholes you do not convert anything back with exp bs is already set up for geometric analysis so you need to stay there the reason why analysis is done geometrically is because the distribution of stock returns is assumed to be even though it 's really more like

checks in the us anyway are only good for six months after they have been written after that under the us uniform code they are considered stale checks and banks need not accept them my experience is that they generally wo n't but you probably should n't count on that either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks the check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued its value for that purpose may be limited you can try depositing it and see what happens if that does n't work or you do n't want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan point out that this check went uncashed and ask them to send you a replacement if they have n't already done so you might want to check your own records for that there should n't be any problem with this note many business checks have a statement printed on them that they 're only good for 90 days or so if yours does you can skip trying to cash it just contact the retirement plan offices

the biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation which is called risk the scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict price portfolio doubles and you need to consider risk one way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is sharpe ratio risk adjusted return or the related ratio one piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk but that is not telling the whole story when you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk you are trying to avoid 10 tax on the stock grant but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10 differential tax $ 1000 an alternative to a single stock is to invest in an etf much lower risk which you can buy and hold for a long time and the price growth of an etf ex spy can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth fluctuation look up the beta volatility of your stock compared to spy for example ibm compare the beta of ibm and tsla and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like tesla over ibm what is the beta of your stock and how willing are you to accept that risk when you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions and mix your portfolio look up beta balanced you can smooth out the variability reduce the risk although you may reduce your absolute return this can not be done with a single stock but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant keep the grant shares and still effectively manage risk some years ago i had accumulated over 10,000 shares grants options in a company where i worked during the time i worked there their price varied between $ 30/share and < $ 1/share i was able to liquidate at $

yes you can trade your properties go to the county recorder 's office to find out the exact procedure deeds generally have specific language to use and you must describe the property accurately in the deed if you want to do the transfer yourself you will need to make sure you have the language correct also you might want to do a title search to make sure that there are no claims against the property your brother is trading you such as by a lender who might have loaned money to him with the property as collateral 3 yes the normal way in the us is quitclaim deeds 4 a quitclaim deed only lists the money or other consideration that changes hands 5 since it is a trade for equal value there are no taxes 6 no normally a lawyer is only needed if you are dealing with a stranger and the transaction is complex as long as you follow the procedures of the clerk 's office correctly there should be no need for a lawyer in fact a lawyer might be undesirable because they could slow things down also since this is a non standard trade a lawyer actually has a higher chance of screwing something up because they will not give it long thought the way you would also they will use and mail instead of actually going to the office another source of error which you can avoid by doing the process correctly ie visiting the office lawyers do n't like getting out of their chairs and this causes them to make a lot of mistakes

the simple answer is absolutely   with the parameters you quote if you will pay off the loan in 82 months or less you will be ahead taking the variable rate you have put your finger on the important question as well the higher initial interest is buying insurance against rates rising if you do n't pay off the loan within 82 months   i suspect the contract loan term is much longer than that because otherwise a variable rate does not make sense   you need to assess whether the insurance you are buying is worth the premium   you can look at what the formula for the variable rate would set the rate at today it is probably somewhat higher than the   that will tell you how much rates have to rise to make the variable rate go above note that if the loan term is around 160 months and it could well be 180 months 15 years you can afford the interest to rise to about 6.2 for the last half and you will still be dollars ahead   it could even rise higher if you discount expenses in the future   you could also hope that if inflation rises to make interest rates rise like that you will get cost of living raises that make this easy to pay

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

you should ask your employer to issue an updated payslip showing the correct gross salary deductions and net salary and then repay to the employer the difference between the net salary in your old wrong pay slip and the new correct one you should also get them to confirm that they have corrected any information they sent hmrc at the end of the tax year when you get a showing your salary for the year make sure that it is consistent with the corrected salary amount and check that the tax it shows as being deducted is also correct for that gross salary for the year if you are still employed by them then you could just ask them to withhold the overpayment in your next salary payment at which point the income tax would sort itself out because paye is calculated based on cumulative totals if the overpayment had happened at the end of the tax year march then there 'd be some risk of it messing up your tax payments in some cases it 's also possible that withholding from the next salary payment could make a difference to the total national insurance you end up paying broadly if you earn below the primary threshold of £ you might lose out if you earn close to the upper earnings limit of £ you could end up gaining

you have a large number of possible choices to make and a lot of it does depend upon what interests you when you are older the first thing to note is the difference between isas and pension contribution schemes tax wise which is of course the taxation point when you contribute to your pensions scheme it is done before taxation which is why when you draw from your pension scheme you have to pay income tax conversely your isa is something you contribute to after you have already paid income tax so besides the 10 tax on dividends if you hold any assets which may them it is tax free when you draw on it regardless of how much you have accrued over the years   now when it comes to the question what is the best way to save the answer is almost certainly going to be filling your pension to the point where you 're going to retire just on the edge of the limit and then putting the rest into isas this way you will not be paying the higher rates of tax associated with breaking the lifetime limit but also get maximum contributions into your various schemes there is an exception to this of course which is the return on investment if you do not have access to a sipp self invested personal pension you may be able to receive a far higher return on investment when using a stocks shares isa in which case the fact that you have to pay taxes prior to funding it may not make a significant difference the other issue you have as others have mentioned is rent   while now you may be enjoying london it is in my opinion quite likely that will change when you get older london has a very high cost of living even compared to the home counties and many of its benefits are not relevant to someone who is retired when you retire it is quite possible that you will see it fit to take a large sum out of your various savings and purchase a house which means that regardless of how much you are drawing out you will be able to have somewhere to live renting is fine when you are working but when you have a certain amount of admittedly growing funds that have to last you indefinitely who knows if it will last you

the flaw in your reasoning is that you are assuming that renting a house is easy and automatic who is going to manage the property your parents what are you going to do if the tenants burn the place down start having drug parties there or secretly have 6 cats who piss everywhere so noone will ever want to rent it again what are you going to do when the house goes for a year and you have to pay a year 's worth of mortgage payments with no rental income what are you going to do when some deadbeat decides to stop paying the rent but wo n't move out and when you try to evict him he goes to court to stop you you going to fly to nj to make the court appearances unless you sell your existing house or your parents buy you out then you need to stay you should not attempt to own two houses at once with one of the houses located not where you are at that will not turn out well also just as an aside 30-year mortgages are not an investment they are a way to lose money usually people get them because they want a big beautiful house that they can not afford so they borrow the money that is not investing that is wasting money to live in luxurious circumstances if you want to become wealthy buy a property you can afford not something that you have to string out payments for 30 years

as pete b says something is not adding up if your story is correct you should still have the legitimate check from your employer if that is the case your solution is simple you     if you do not have the good cheque then you are in deep trouble because then either you did n't have it in which case you have been lying to us or you cashed it and spent the money which means you knew that you had given the bad cheque to the liquor store either of those mean you have been deliberately a fraud as for the consequences be aware that passing a bad cheque is a crime and if the store reports it as such it is not unlikely that the police will want to investigate if they decide you did this deliberately you could be arrested and you might well end up in jail   we will do you the favour of assuming that you still have the good cheque and option 1 is possible

are there any monthly administrative fees on those loans that are charged separately if not you should just pay as much as you can as quick as you can to get the loan amount down on those loans with the highest interest rate if there are no separate fees on the loans then it 's just a lump of money with some interest rate the smaller loans will eventually drop away one by one have a celebration to remark the occasion when that happens i assume the payment is split evenly between the loans restructure if you get a better deal from someplace   delay buying new stuff until you get the loan amount down pay as much as you can as quickly as you can but keep enough money in your pocket to survive a month or two so that you do n't need to get any more loans in case something unexpected happens

for the record i am not the one that downvoted you because you raise a decent point opinion however you should consider the impact this has on the rest of us many employers have already said that they are not hiring people because of concerns on what the ruling means for them that could have been a ploy to pressure politicians to back down from it however that probably would n't explain everything they are going to paying more for insurance when hiring no doubt that is n't good when we are already having a hard time getting them back to work so i would n't write off capitalists concerns so easily secondly they are n't going to be able it anymore than before unless they are forced to pay for part time workers and others previously exempt i did n't read enough on this to know one way or the other however if workers are n't getting anymore coverage from their employers then the added cost higher premiums would n't mean much for any of us actually they would still be externalizing the cost instead of the government picking up the bill it would be americans who are n't getting insurance from the employer who are forced to pay for the penalty

yes i really do n't disagree with anything that you 're arguing regarding social mobility in general the lack of social safety net in the us and uk do n't enable social mobility   i would also point out that rich kids tend to inherit and so tend to stay in the class with which they were born to for instance i know a lawyer whose son is a fuck up sure he 'll have six figure income all his life due to inheriting dad 's money but he 'll never earn anything on his own is that success i do n't think so   i would also assert that the point is more salient in the middle class just because my parents are middle class does n't mean that i would be middle class there 's quite a few ways that i could have off and ended up quite poor i know a consultant who was solidly middle class who 's son flips burgers for a living said son is a bloody smart person from what i heard but never got his shit together   so yes i agree that decreasing social mobility is a problem i 'd also argue that success is only on luck

gt;you understand the purpose of insurance right it 's ok to tax the rich but not ok for them to cash in on insurance   you understand that no employees pay for this insurance right the rich employees do n't pay for this benefit the employers do    that being said this is not something that is an easy question to answer one one hand if someone is out of a job then the black and white answer is yes they are absolutely allowed to use these benefits the other hand if this person has the ability not to utilize these benefits because they were able to create a by investments or simply saving then why would they need to use it i think that using this specific benefit should be a last resort not one to use because you do n't want to use any of your money not that i m saying this happened but again if someone is making this kind of money one would think they should have the wherewithal to have an emergency savings fund for this exact situation    there is nothing inherently illegal about this however it is imo morally questionable

if you plan on holding the money for 15 years until your daughter turns 21 then advanced algebra tells me she is 6 years old i think the real question is what do you intend for your daughter to get out of this   if you want her to get a real return on her money mike has laid out the information to get you started deciding on that but at 6 is part of the goal also teaching her about financial principles of saving etc if so consider the following when the money was physically held in the piggy bank your daughter had theoretical control over it she was exercising restraint for delayed gratification even if she did not really understand that yet and even if she really did n't understand money did n't know what she would do with it by taking this money and putting it away for her you are taking her out of the decision making unless you plan on giving her access to the account letting her decide when to take it out   still you could talk her through what you 're doing and ask her how she feels about it but perhaps she is too young to understand what committing the money away until 21 really means and if for example she wants to buy a bike when she is 10 do you want her to see the fruits of her saved money finally consider that if you or you your daughter depending on whether you want her to help in the decision decide to put the money in a financial institution in some manner the risk you are taking on may need to be part of the lesson for her if you want to teach the general principles of saving then putting it in bonds savings etc may be sufficient even if inflation lowers the value of the money if you want to teach principles of investing then perhaps consider waiting until she can understand why you are doing that to a kid i think the principles of saving delayed gratification can be taught but the principles of assuming risk for greater reward is a bit more complex

keep in mind that all of the information below assumes that being said here are some examples of national tax laws relating to barter transactions obviously this is n't an exhaustive list but based on my grossly non representative sample i think it 's fairly safe to assume that barter transactions are more likely taxable than not   you 're referring to a barter system in the united states the irs is very specific about this see the section titled bartering   bartering is an exchange of property or services the fair market    value of goods and services exchanged is fully taxable and must be    included on form 1040 in the income of both parties the irs also provides more details bartering occurs when you exchange goods or services without    exchanging money an example of bartering is a plumber doing repair    work for a dentist in exchange for dental services you must include    in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods    and services received in exchange for goods or services you provide or    may provide under the bartering arrangement generally you report this income on form 1040 schedule c pdf    profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez pdf net    profit from business if you failed to report this income correct    your return by filing a form 1040x pdf refer to topic for    amended return information so yes the net value of goods or services is most likely taxable according to the australian tax office barter transactions are and deductible for income tax    purposes to the same extent as other cash or credit transactions her 's revenue and customs states that if you supply services or goods new or second hand and receive other    goods or services in payment there are two separate supplies you must account for vat and so must your customer if they 're    vat registered the vat treatment is the same as for part exchanges    you must both account for vat on the amounts you would each have paid    for the goods or services if there had been no barter and they had    been paid for with money searching the website of the federal tax service for the russian word for barter does n't yield any results but that might be because even between google translate and the rest of the internet i do n't speak russian that being said i did manage to find this translated from the first full paragraph of the russian beginning with на the tax on personal income is paid by citizens of the russian    federation with all types of income received by them in the calendar    year either in cash or in kind since bartering would probably qualify as an in kind transaction it would likely be taxable   the south african revenue service includes barter transactions in the supply of goods taxed under the vat   the term supply is defined very broadly and includes all forms of    supply and any derivative of the term irrespective of where the    supply is effected the term includes performance in terms of a sale    rental agreement instalment credit agreement or barter transaction look for section 3.6 supply and taxable supply found on of the current version of the linked document

i think your very long list of possible assumptions makes a point of your own   to state 15 as a general value is bogus   i think in most cases the 15 is merely a popular meme    to give any fixed number or percentage of income saved is insufficient without expanding things in the way you show   therefore a formula in which at least a handful of variables can be plugged into it seems like the right approach   and this is what is being discussed here with the monte carlo method

i asked this question in another sub but i thought i might also get answers here    i was just wondering how pension funds or investment firms calculate the interest that they give to their members or clients in the us or whichever country you are from    i ask this because i have a gut feeling that the national pension fund in my country does it the wrong way and is basically cheating people so i wanted to make a comparison with other countries forgive me if i 'm wrong and there 's nothing to worry about    ok so what they do is collect money in a given financial year which starts in july and ends in june let 's say they collect 100 million in 2010 11 they then invest this 100 million in the year july 2011 june 2012 after deducting admin costs and all that interest for this 2010 11 money is declared on october 1st 2012    that basically means that money someone contributed in july 2010 will earn interest 2 years later in 2012 i just feel like that is not how it should be done but you can correct me if i 'm wrong    they also regularly give interest at about 12 which is good when i read about interest rates in the us being around 7 but i feel like since this interest is basically announced after 2 years that 12 is n't as good as it seems    someone help me understand if i 'm wrong   thanks

you get paid interest on deposits because banks only keep a fraction of the deposits on hand the rest is put to other uses such as loaning money to others if you deposit money and yield 1 interest the bank is able to fund an auto loan at 5 by saving you are actually making more capital available in the marketplace fixed or durable assets like gold real property or durable goods are different their value is based on attributes such as demand gold oil or location real property if you bought an apartment in manhattan in 1975 it appreciated greatly in value over the course of 30 years but it did so because demand for apartments in new york city grew while the supply of apartments grew more slowly the government prints money for two core reasons think of it this way money is valuable because it is money

please realize that your issuer can close the account for any number of reasons   inactivity is one as having a credit line open costs them money and if you never charge anything the company does n't get any transaction fees from vendors nor does the company get to charge you any interest an occasional charge is likely to keep your card from being closed automatically but it is not a guarantee another reason they may close the account is that you have other bad marks show up on your credit score or their criteria for offering you the card change so you no longer match their target demographic i have a credit card issued by my credit union that i have not used for a couple of years they will not close the card account because my other accounts are still very profitable for them if i were not an otherwise profitable customer i would n't be surprised if they closed my credit card account if you are serious about keeping the account open you should probably have more than a trivial amount of usage

here is how the visa network works a visa transaction is a carefully orchestrated process when a visa    account holder uses a visa card to buy a pair of shoes it ’s actually    the acquirer the merchant ’s bank that reimburses the merchant for    the shoes then the issuer the account holder ’s bank reimburses    the acquirer usually within 24 to 48 hours lastly the issuer    collects from the account holder by withdrawing funds from the account    holder ’s bank account if a debit account is used or through billing    if a credit account is used i read this to mean the merchant 's bank the acquirer bank gives the merchant the money within 2 days via the card issuer 's bank the issuing bank is the one that provides the credit feature since that bank wo n't get reimbursed until the shopper 's bill is paid or perhaps even longer if the shopper carries a balance you 'll notice the credit card company visa mc etc is only involved in the process as a way of passing messages of course they take a fee for this service so seller ultimately get 's less than the buyer bought the shoes for

realize this is almost a year old but i just wanted to comment on something in answer above   whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game from a market maker 's perspective their primary goal is not necessarily to make money by you being wrong it is to make money on the bid offer spread and hedging their book and potentially that being said the market maker would likely be quoting one side of the market away from top of the book if they do n't want to take exposure in that direction i.e. their bid will be lower than the highest bid available or their offer higher than the lowest offer available this is n't really going to change anything if you 're trading on an exchange but important to consider if you can only see the prices your broker dealer provides to you and they are your counterparty in the trade

this answer is an attempt to answer the actual question posed please keep in mind that this applies specifically to the equifax credit model that mint uses as mentioned in the accepted answer and that different models may react in different ways or not at all as mentioned in the comments the number of total accounts you have does not have much bearing on your overall credit score if you click on mint 's about total accounts link you get the following statement total accounts has a low impact on your score second the way the total accounts score is represented is misleading this is not a count of the total number of accounts you have open but rather how many accounts you have in your total history mint 's under this metric is flat out wrong try to have a good mix of credit lines open to back up the assertion that this is looking at total accounts in your credit history rather than just those that are open my mint report shows 2 open accounts and 7 closed accounts for a total of 9 under the total accounts metric i am plotted smack in the middle of the not bad range right where people with 9 would be plotted so the proper advice here is to just let it be and only open new accounts as you need them as you amass credit history this metric will continue to grow naturally it should never decrease you may ask then why did your overall score decrease when you paid off your student loans most likely because your average age of credit dropped when you closed your loan account if you 're like most people i know your student loan is one of your oldest accounts so closing that account will hurt your score credit age is measured only on your open accounts

you 're mostly correct although i think you 're missing something essential about no arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument   black scholes makes an arbitrage argument which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows and this is generally a sound argument   notice however that bs is ultimately an equilibrium model it tells you the correct price of an option if the assumptions of bs hold and does n't necessarily match observed market prices   a no arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices or yields or whatever into the model so that there can not be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model   this comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems where equilibrium models like or cox ross wo n't perfectly reproduce the current observed term structure and so imply an arbitrage opportunity   no arbitrage models like hull white specifically match the model 's term structure to observed yields prices so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it   it 's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are not part of the observed term structure   as for equivalent martingale measures you might think about it more generally   the process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual which is hard to use for pricing to a different one that 's easier to use but will result in the same prices this is nearly always a risk neutral probability   you can think of equivalent martingale   pricing as asking how would this security behave and be priced in a world that is completely risk neutral and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent   edit grammar

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

this can be done and there have been many good suggestions on things to do and watch out for   but to my shock i do n't see anyone offering any words of caution about property managers whatever you do do n't assume they have your best interests at heart   do not assume that no news is good news and that if you are n't hearing of problems and are just collecting rent checks everything must be fine you can easily end up with tenants you would never have allowed yourself or tenants with pets that you would not have allowed etc   especially if the manager does n't want you to have a vacancy and potentially lose you as a client they may very well lower their standards just to get the place occupied   and a year or two or three later you may find yourself looking at a very large repair bill and wonder how on earth it could have happened when you supposedly had someone looking out for your property there are quality ethical property managers out there   they are not all bad to be certain   but whatever you do check up on them   and with multiple properties especially if in multiple areas states etc this can be nearly a full time job in itself   as the saying goes trust but verify   i have never found this to apply more than with rental properties and property management do n't leave anything significant to them 100   you ca n't even assume that a rule like all expenses over $ 50 must be cleared by me first as that can simply mean that they do n't bother to come to you for certain kinds of repairs that would cost more than that or that they just get them taken care of by their own person done poorly illegally etc and never tell you   never trust their choice of tenants blindly   visit the place yourself at least every few months a quick at a minimum or better if you can arrange a reason to walk through the house personally   check the back yard never assume that the front yard is indicative of anything else   never assume that a no pets rule will be followed or that tenants would n't lie to the management about having pets   never assume that the tenants wo n't move additional people into the property as well always expect a bare minimum of 1 month vacancy every year and an additional minimum of 1 month 's rental revenue in unexpected maintenance repairs every year   this is at a minimum   you might do much better than this and have a high quality tenant in place for years who costs next to nothing in extra maintenance   but do not count on it rental real estate investing looks so simple on paper where it 's just numbers   but reality has a very rude habit of surprising you when you least expect it after all no one expects the spanish good luck

i 'll compare it to a situation that is different but will involve the same cash flow   imagine the buyer agrees that you buy only 70 of the house right now and the remaining 30 in 7 years time   it would be obviously fair to pay 70 of today 's value today pay 30 of a reasonable rent for 7 years because 30 of the house is n't owned by you then pay 30 of the value that the house has in 7 years time 30 of the value in 7 years is the same as 30 of the value today plus 30 of whatever the house gained in value   instead you pay 70 of today 's value you pay no rent for the 30 that you do n't own then in 7 years time you pay 30 of today 's value plus 50 of whatever the house gained in value so you are basically exchanging 30 of seven years rent plus interest for 20 of the gain in value over 7 years which might be zero or might be very little or a lot in which case you are still better off    obviously you need to set up a bullet proof contract a lawyer will also tell you what to put into the contract in case the house burns down and ca n't be rebuilt or you add an extension to the home which increases the value   and keep in mind that this is a good deal if the house does n't increase in value but if the house increases in value a lot you benefit anyway a situation where the worse the deal turns out to be after 7 years the better the result for you in addition the relative carries the risk of non payment which the bank obviously is not willing to do

leverage here is referring to financial leverage this is the practice of levering ie increasing like the use of a lever to increase the amount of weight you can lift the value of your investment by taking on debt   for example if you have 100k in cash you can buy a 100k rental property assume the property makes 10k a year net of expenses 10 now assume the bank will also give you a 100k mortgage at 3 you could take the mortgage plus your cash and buy a 200k rental property this would earn you 20k from the rental property less 3k a year in interest costs the 3 your total income would be 17k and since you only used 100k of your own money your rate of return would now be 17 instead of 10 this is financial leveraging note that this increases your risk because if your investment fails not only have you lost your own money you now need to pay back the bank beta riders appears to be negative commentary on investors who use beta to calculate the value of a particular stock without regard to other quantitative factors therefore leveraged beta riders are those who take on additional risk by taking on debt to invest and invest in a manner that the author would perhaps considered blindly following beta however i have never seen this term before and it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants a quant process driven discipline appears to be positive commentary on investors who use detailed quantitative analysis to develop rules which they rigorously follow to invest i have never seen this exact phrasing before and like the above it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants i am not providing any opinion on whether beta riding or quant processes are good or bad things this is just my attempt to interpret the quote as you presented it note that i did not go to the article to get context so perhaps something else in the article could skew the language to mean something other than what i have presented

have you actually read the wikipedia article to calculate the djia the sum of the prices of all 30 stocks is divided by a divisor the dow divisor the divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits spinoffs or similar structural changes to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the djia early on the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies which made the djia at first a simple arithmetic average the present divisor after many adjustments is less than one meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components that is djia = d where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the dow divisor events such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies the index alter the sum of the component prices in these cases in order to avoid in the index the dow divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide djia = = the dow divisor was on december 24 presently every $ 1 change in price in a particular stock within the average equates to a or 1 ÷ point movement knowing the old prices new prices e.g. following a split and old divisor you can easily compute the new divisor edit also the detailed methodology is published by sp indices pdf edit 2 for simplicity 's sake assume the djia is an index that contains 4 stocks with a price of $ 100.00 each one of the stocks splits 2:1 meaning the new price share is $ 50.00 plugging the numbers into the above equation we can determine the new dow divisor 400 4 = 350 d = > d = 3.5

1 as i said the above is not actually anything like a genuine history of how money emerged it 's an explain it to a five year old parable to answer where does the money go in an economic contraction   2 it 's also not defense endorsement apology for any particular set of policies or historical theory of money it 's a picture book describing the workings of an internal combustion engine using cartoon characters not a on the social and environmental implications of american car culture    that said in the parable the reasons why the simplified in the town chose to accept the fiat currency are pretty straightforward and are actually explained   they were previously using a system of a whole bunch of separate privately issued currencies each with complex and hard to evaluate credit risks bob 's potato certificate versus jane 's potato certificate versus your apple certificate versus my deer certificate this was causing problems and confusion about how much any given certificate was actually worth    the system proposed was proposed in a way that was at least as credible as the best existing system    last but not least they accepted the new currency for exactly the same reason that you accept dollar euros or whatever because everyone else does    there was no law preventing any of them from still trading apple ious in fact we still traded them later in the example except denominated in loddars i could have asked you for the last note to denominated in apples but that would probably have been harder to trade than the currency that everyone else is using    i said i would n't get into the gold standard debate and i wo n't and here 's why the debate hinges entirely and solely on whether you believe that a good fiat currency is possible and realistically sustainable if you do then fiat currency makes a lot more sense in every respect if you do n't then fiat currency is always just a catastrophe waiting to happen    my parable shows the mechanics of how money works it does n't say whether the system is good or bad or whether they should have accepted the fiat system proposed or held out for a better one or rejected it altogether    you can argue that internal combustion engines are bad or that much better alternatives are available or that nobody should use them but that does n't make a description of they work incorrect

i do n't believe there is any particular structural or financial reason that outgoing wire transfers cost so much in canada their costs are no higher than other countries and lower than many   wires seem to be an area where the canadian banks have decided people do n't comparison shop so it 's not a competitive advantage to offer a better price the rates you quoted are on the low side $ 80 for a international wire is not unusual and hsbc charges up to $ 150 there are several alternative ways to transfer money domestically in canada if the recipient banks at the same bank it 's possible to go into a branch and transfer money directly from your own account to their account i 've never been charged for this   the transfer is immediate   but it could n't be done online last time i checked for transfers where you do n't know the recipients bank account you can pay online with interac e transfers offered by most canadian banks   it 's basically e mailing money   it usually costs $ 1 to $ 1.50 per transfer and has limits on how much you can send per day week each of the banks also have a bill pay service but unlike similar services in the us where they mail a paper check if the recipient is n't on their system each canadian bank has a limited number of possible payees mostly utilities governments major stores

they are just now where you might expect them they ca n't bring it to major cities yet but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas they are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies there is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there 's no reason to not run fiber if you 're going to the trouble if when these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors in my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds within two years charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap    fiber is n't that far off for most people because from what i understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them and the way it works is odd in that no normal isp owns the fiber it 's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it this is just what i 've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so i do n't know everything maybe someone else here has more information

there 's several approaches to the stock market the first thing you need to do is decide which you 're going to take the first is the case of the standard investor saving money for retirement or some other long term goal he already has a job he 's not really interested in another job he does n't want to spend thousands of hours doing research he should buy mutual funds or similar instruments to build diversified holdings all over the world he 's going to have is money invested for years at a time he wo n't earn spectacular amazing awesome returns but he 'll earn solid returns there will be a few years when he loses money but he 'll recover it just by waiting the second is the case of the day trader he attempts to understand ultra short term movements in stock prices due to news rumors and other things which stem from quirks of the market and the people who trade in it he buys a stock and when it 's up a fraction of a percent half an hour later sells it this is very risky requires a lot of attention and a good amount of money to work with and you can lose a lot of money too the modern day trader also needs to compete with the high frequency trading desks of wall street firms with super optimized computer networks located a block away from the exchange so that they can make orders faster than the guy two blocks away i do n't recommend this approach at all the third case is the guy who wants to beat the market he 's got long term aspirations and vision but he does a lot more research into individual companies figures out which are worth buying and which are not and invests accordingly this is how warren buffett made it big you can make it work but it 's like starting a business it 's a ton of work requires a good amount of money to get going and you still risk losing lots of it   the fourth case is the guy who mostly invests in broad market indexes like 1 but has a little money set aside for the stocks he 's researched and likes enough to invest in like 3 he 's not going to make money like warren buffett but he may get a little bit of an edge on the rest of the market if he does n't and ends up losing money there instead the rest of his stocks are still chugging along the last and way is to treat it all like magic buying things without understanding them or a clear plan of what you 're going to do with them you risk losing all your money you also risk having it stagnate good to see you want to avoid it

in the uk at least dealers definitely want you to take finance they get benefits from the bank which are not for doing this these benefits translate directly to increased commission and internal rewards for the individual salesman it 's conceivable that the salesman will be less inclined to put himself out for you in any way by your deal as much as you 'd like if he 's not going to get incentives out of it indeed since he 's taking a hit on his commission from you paying in cash it 's in his best interests to perhaps be with you during price negotiation so will the salesman be frustrated with you if you choose to pay in cash yes absolutely though this may manifest in different ways in some cases the dealer will offer to pay off the finance for you allowing you to pay directly in cash while the dealer still gets the bank referral reward so that everyone wins this is a behind the scenes secret in the industry which is not made public for obvious reasons it 's arguably on fraud if the salesman likes you and trusts you then you may be able to get such an arrangement if this does not seem likely to occur i would not go out of my way to disclose that i am planning to pay with cash that being said you 'll usually be asked very early on whether you are seeking to pay cash or credit the salesman wants to know for the reasons outlined above and there is little use lying about it when you 're shortly going to have to come clean anyway

this sounds like it makes no difference if you behave in the same manner i.e. take the same vacation time for example say you work 1 hour and take 1 hour of vacation and the current hourly rate is $   you would make $ 2 using your formula new rate = 1 1 + = 1 2 = $ 2   so they would pay you $ 2 for the hour you worked and then you would take the 1 hour of vacation with no pay if you plan on taking less vacation than used in the formula you make more money   if you plan on taking more vacation you make less money

a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

disclaimer it 's hard to be definitive as there may be some law or tax rule i 'm not aware of from a uk perspective this should be perfectly legal if it 's just a one off or occasional thing for personal reasons rather than being done in the course of a business there probably are n't any tax implications in theory if there 's an identifiable profit from the transaction e.g. because you originally obtained the inr at a lower exchange rate then you might be liable to capital gains tax however this is only payable above approximately £ 10 k capital gains see so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year you do n't need to worry about that i would only recommend doing this if you trust each other if one side transfers the money and the other does n't the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally even though i think that in theory it should be possible if the sums involved are large you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations or they may want documentation of the source of the funds reason for the transaction this does n't automatically mean you 'll have a problem but the transaction may receive some scrutiny i think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved

on my recent visit to the bank i was told that money coming into the nre account can only be foreign currency and for nro accounts the money can come in local currency but has to be a valid source of income e.g. rent or investments in india yes this is correct as per regulation in india now if we use 3rd party remittances like or transferwise etc they usually covert the foreign currency into local currency like inr and then deposit it the remittance services are better suited for transferring funds to normal savings accounts of your loved ones most remittance services would transfer funds using a domestic clearing network and hence the trace that funds originated outside of india is lost there could be some generic remittance that may have direct tie up with some banks to do direct transfers how can we achieve this in either nre nro accounts if not what are the other options you can do a wire transfer swift from us to indian nre account you can also use the remittance services if available from banks where you hold nre account for example from hdfc for an nre account in hdfc or from icici for an nre account in icici or from sbi etc these would preserve the history that funds originated from outside india similarly you can also deposit a foreign currency check into indian bank account the funds would take around month or so to get credited all other funds can be deposited in nro account

do not buy this car first i want to say i love bmw 's   there 's a reason why they call them ultimate driving machine and why other car manufacturers compare their new models to bmws   i own and i absolutely love it   every time you get into the car it just begs you to push and abuse it   everything from steering response to throttle to engine sound   awesome car   however 1 bmw is not known for their reliability   i 've had to do numerous things to this car and if i did n't do the work myself i like tinkering with cars it would be a pretty big money pit and actually still is   german parts are more expensive then regular cars   labor will run you if you take it for service   right now my car is on jack stands while i 'm fixing an oil leak replacing cooling system components which are known to fail and doing work with the cam timing system which uses bad seals 2 if you buy a used car which is 3 years old just remember all the items and everything that wants to break will break 3 years sooner on you   someone else already pre enjoyed your car 's maintenance free days   at things will start to go   ask me how i know   so you 'll start paying for maintenance way before your 5-year loan expires   compare this to the acura i used to have   acura aka honda had miles when i sold it and i never once got stranded with the acura 3 fuel economy is not that good and btw you have to use the most expensive gas 4 if you are really set on buying a bmw because you enjoy driving and wo n't drive like an old lady my apologies to those old ladies that drive at least the speed limit but you are not the majority then still do not by this one and check out auctions   i bought my 2003 in 2005 for when it cost over 40k new   you could probably find one with less than 20k miles on it my final advice is either a learn to at least do basic maintenance or b stick to always buying new cars which do n't have any issues in first 4 7 years then move on before you have to schedule your life around your cars on the bright side i doubt you 'll have to ever replace the exhaust and you can buy tail lights on e bay for roughly $ 60

i am also neither an attorney nor a tax advisor yes the rent money you pay to your friend is taxable income but suddenly all kinds of expenses around the house including a fraction of the interest paid on the mortgage become tax deductible for example let 's say that the mortgage is $ 1000 month and you pay your friend $ 500 month if you live in 50 of the house then he can deduct 50 plus or minus of the expenses associated with owning the house including all of these things 50 of them anyway become tax deductible   it 'd be quite possible for him to take a loss on the endeavor and actually reduce his taxes every year until it comes time to sell selling a property that has been used as a rental is more taxable than selling a property that has been a personal residence

the offering price is what the company will raise by selling the shares at that price   however this is n't usually what the general public sees as often there will be shows to drive up demand so that there will be buyers for the stock   that demand is what you see on the first day when the general public can start buying the stock   if one is an employee relative or friend of someone that is offered friends and family shares they may be able to buy at the offering price pricing of ipo from wikipedia states around the idea of pricing a company planning an ipo typically appoints a lead manager known as    a to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the    shares should be issued there are two primary ways in which the price    of an ipo can be determined either the company with the help of its    lead managers fixes a price fixed price method or the price can    be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data    compiled by the book building historically some ipos both globally and in the united states have    been underpriced the effect of initial underpricing an ipo is to    generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes    publicly traded flipping or quickly selling shares for a profit can    lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares    of the ipo at the offering price however underpricing an ipo results    in lost potential capital for the issuer one extreme example is    ipo which helped fuel the ipo mania of the late 90 's    internet era underwritten by bear stearns on november 13 1998 the    ipo was priced at $ 9 per share the share price quickly increased    1000 after the opening of trading to a high of $ 97 selling pressure    from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down and    it closed the day at $ 63 although the company did raise about $ 30    million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of    demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the    company might have left upwards of $ 200 million on the table the danger of is also an important consideration if a    stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will    pay the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to    sell shares even if they sell all of the issued shares the stock may    fall in value on the first day of trading if so the stock may lose    its and hence even more of its value this could result    in losses for investors many of whom being the most favored clients    of the underwriters perhaps the best known example of this is the    facebook ipo in 2012 underwriters therefore take many factors into consideration when    pricing an ipo and attempt to reach an offering price that is low    enough to stimulate interest in the stock but high enough to raise an    adequate amount of capital for the company the process of determining    an optimal price usually involves the underwriters syndicate    arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional    investors some researchers e.g. c. and c. swift 2009 believe that    the underpricing of ipos is less a deliberate act on the part of    issuers and/or underwriters than the result of an over reaction on    the part of investors swift 2009 one potential method    for determining underpricing is through the use of ipo underpricing    algorithms this may be useful for seeing the difference in that example where the offering price is $ yet the stock traded much higher than that initially

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

the number one reason to borrow is quite simple when you have no other choice the primary reason to do this is when renovations or additions must be made in a timeframe that precludes you being able to save enough money to pay cash 's example of a kid on the way with no space to put him is a very good hypothetical disaster recovery is another insurance does n't cover everything and can sometimes be slow to pay out and even if the payoff will rebuild the house exactly the way it was these situations are good opportunities to improve on what you had since you already have to call in the contractors to demo and rebuild the cost to do that is sunk and the incremental cost of improvements or even additional square footage is relatively minor other acceptable reasons to borrow are when cost of capital is very cheap a typical amortized heloc is pretty expensive when paid on schedule but if you can pay it off very early i.e. when you sell the home next month or you get a good deal on the interest rate a subsidized disaster recovery loan perhaps you have to be careful with these as they 're not intended to turn a burnt down into a mcmansion the cost of borrowing can be acceptable even if you had cash savings for the project you have other uses for the cash that can offset cost of borrowing this generally requires the first point to be true as well as it 's a general rule that borrowing $ 10,000 costs you more than you would gain by investing $ 10,000 but there are situations in which the reverse can be true if you have $ 10k in oil or major tech stocks right now it would probably be a bad move to liquidate them for home improvements if you can get a heloc at less than 6 you can realize a net gain in home value from the reno these situations are rare in cases of an already livable home flippers which make their living on renovating homes for a profit generally choose homes with obvious but easy to fix problems that depress home value because they look worse than they are if you bought your home without any such problems you probably paid something close to market value at the time and so you 're probably behind the curve however if you or your family in the case of an estate transfer have owned the home for a long time long enough for things to fall way out of date then you can catch up a lot of market value with one renovation where if the home had had two or three renovations along the way a reno now would n't gain you as much value

you 're missing the concept of systemic risk which is the risk of the entire market or an entire asset class diversification is about achieving a balance between risk and return that 's appropriate for you your investment in vanguard 's fund although diversified between many public companies is still restricted to one asset class in one country yes you lower your risk by investing in all of these companies but you do n't erase it entirely   clearly there is still risk despite your diversification you may decide that you want other investments or a different asset allocation that reduce the overall risk of your portfolio over the long run you may earn a high level of return but never forget that there is still risk involved bonds seem pretty worthless at least until i retire according to your profile you 're about my age our cohort will probably begin retiring sometime around 2050 or later and no one knows what the bond market will look like over the next 40 years we may have forecasts for the next few years but not for almost four decades writing off an entire asset class for almost four decades does n't seem like a good idea also bonds are like equity and all other asset classes in that there are different levels of risk within the asset class too when calculating the overall risk return profile of my portfolio i certainly do n't consider treasuries as the same risk level as corporate bonds or high yield or junk bonds from abroad   depending on your risk preferences you may find that an asset allocation that includes us and/or international bonds fixed income international equities real estate and cash to make rebalancing your asset allocation easier reduces your risk to levels you 're willing to tolerate while still allowing you to achieve returns during periods where one asset class e.g. equities is losing value or performing below your expectations

gt;it 's tremendously more difficult to make large percentage gains on $ 1 billion than it is to make gains on $ 1 million   this is true however when you consider the 2 and 20 fee structure that is typical of hedge funds it becomes evident why managing more money is generally better with a fund with 1b under management they earn 20 million dollars for turning the lights on even if they only have a 3 return in a given year that 's another six million dollars    a fund managing a million in assets would have to have a return of 40 to net $ 100,000 so while the law of diminishing returns may be working in your favor if you are managing less money if your goal is to make money for yourself it 's pretty clear why managing more money is better

an extra payment on a loan is broadly speaking a known return risk free investment that the return on the investment is in reduced costs going forward instead of increased revenue is basically immaterial assuming you have sufficient cash flow to handle either situation we ca n't know what the interest rates will be like going forward but we can know what they are today because you gave us those numbers in your question quick now given the choice between a known return of 3.7 annually and a known return of 7 annually with identical and extremely low risk where would you invest your money by putting the $ 15k toward the $ 14k loan you free up $ 140 per month and have $ 1k left that you can put toward the $ 30k loan which will reduce your payment term by $ 1k $ or about 4 months you will be debt free in 14 years 8 months you pay $ 14,000 instead of $ 16,800 on the $ 14,000 loan reducing the total cost of the loan by $ and reduce the cost of the $ 30,000 loan by four months worth of interest which is about $ 175 so the $ 30,000 loan ends up costing you something like $ instead of $ by putting the $ 15k toward the $ 30k loan you cut the principal of that one in half assuming that you keep paying the same amount each month you will reduce the payment term by 7 ½ years and will be debt free in 10 years because the $ 14,000 10-year loan now has the longer term instead of paying $ for the $ 30k loan you end up paying $ plus the $ 15,000 = $ reducing the total cost of the $ 30,000 loan by $ while doing nothing to reduce the cost of the $ 14,000 loan to a first order estimate using the $ 15,000 to pay off the $ 14,000 loan in full will improve your cash flow in the short term but putting the money toward the $ 30,000 loan will give you a three fold better return on investment over the term of both loans and nearly halve the total loan term assuming unchanged monthly payments and unchanged interest rates that 's how powerful compounding interest is

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

i have won a large amount of money on an online casino how reputed is the company have you done any research around it it has taken 2 months for me to see any payouts last week i received $ 2300 check from them   did you win everything in the same period if so there is no reason why they sent you a smaller check of $ 2300 instead of the full amount this should raise a red flag why would someone write multiple checks the only valid reason is you won in different months the payout for first month was $ 2300 and they sent a check the payout for next month is large amount the request for bank details that they would rather wire me the money and they are asking for my banking account number and routing number although giving bank account number and routing has some risks this is the fundamental information that is need to make a credit to your account directly you would be giving this to quite a few entities people in most countries this information is printed on every check that you write from your account is this safe or am i stupid for even considering this online world is full of traps and this could be a scam so proceed with extreme caution insist of check in worst case open a different savings account that does not allow direct debits does not have over draft etc use this to receive money and move it into your regular account

the company had been through many rounds of private financing prior to that   there was a particular round where mercedes benz invested a lot of money which elon credits with saving the company   elon says that the company would probably have survived but just taken longer to get to market or done so at a slower ramp without the government money   of course he may be saying that for whatever pr reasons but he 's been pretty open about when the company was on the brink of death before so i tend to believe it   keep in mind they had already made money on the roadster prior to the government loan not a lot but had they not been spending on model s r&amp;d it would have produced a profit but the whole intent to begin with was to fund model s r&amp;d with the roadster   also the government loan was a loan and that loan was paid back   i do n't see people criticizing nissan for example for taking government loans even though theirs was 10x the size of tesla 's and has not yet been paid back by the way i also am not criticizing nissan for that i 'm just saying neither should be criticized   tesla in fact got the least money of any company out of that particular loan program   including who got more money despite having a worse business plan

i see a couple of ways of getting at this   one would be to switch to a vat   that would capture a good amount of revenue on anything that 's made here   second i want ip to be taxed   we pay property taxes so i think that trademarks and copyrighted works should be taxed just like how real property is taxed   you want to register the burger king logo in the us   sure thing   you will pay a percentage of its value every year and you get to use it exclusively with the full protection of the us courts your taxes help fund   i also see this as a good way out of the ip we 're currently in   copyright has become unreasonably long mostly because disney does n't want to lose the rights to mickey mouse   look i am sympathetic to disney 's argument   mickey genuinely is important to them   but mickey is fucking things up for everyone else   so i think disney should pay a percentage of mickey 's value every year   in exchange they keep their copyright forever as long as they keep paying   now if the copyright tax is n't paid then the property becomes public domain forever   this would let disney have what they want while non profitable copyrights become public domain as they should   anyhow the one thing all the big tax avoiding companies have in common is ip   if you tax their ip in exchange for protection in us courts there 's really no way around that   they will either have to pay or let their ip go public domain

technically the answer is no you ca n't put more money in to that isa in that tax year once you 've transferred it unless you 've transferred it to a stocks and shares isa faqs 7 and 8 from cover these cases q. i have transferred current year payments to my cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa can i make any further payments to a cash isa in this    tax year a. yes provided you have n't already used up your annual isa    investment allowance £ in the tax year 2013 14 when you transfer current year payments to your cash isa to a stocks    and shares isa it is as if that cash isa had never existed any money    you saved up to the date of transfer will be treated as if you had    invested that money directly in the stocks and shares isa for example if you had put £ 2,000 in a cash isa and then transferred    it to a stocks and shares isa you would be able to make further    payments totalling £ in that tax year you could either put all    of the £ in the stocks and shares isa or you could put up to    £ in a cash isa with the same or a different isa manager and    the remainder of the £ in the stocks and shares isa   q. how many isas can i have a. there are limits on the number of isa accounts you can subscribe to    each tax year you can only put money into one cash isa and one stocks    and shares isa but in different years you could choose to save with different    managers there are no limits on the number of different isas you can    hold over time however in practice if you transfer mid year from provider a to provider b provider b has no way of telling whether you have already put money in to the isa with provider a that year or not so you will be able to put more money in   i believe that isa providers do report their subscriptions back to hmrc so they can check for multiple subscriptions over the limit in one tax year but in the past i have done exactly what you describe and it has never been picked up in any way or caused any problem at all as long as you stick to total subscriptions within the limit i 'd guess you 're unlikely to encounter a problem of course i am not a financial advisor so you should take what i say with the same pinch of salt as you would take any other random advice from the internet

economically you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes they are largely separate markets   only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky for example once you buy a house prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment in both markets there is a supply and demand curve but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals the market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house   most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market   this describes a supply demand graph with a very steep demand curve   additionally because of the leverage provided by mortgages the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans   thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change on the other hand apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent 's easily move into apartments if prices change   a small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded   this is the situation where the demand curve is shallow   in addition rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions in a recession people avoid buying but renters continue to rent

if they directly paid for your education it is possible that it would n't count as taxable income to you according to the irs depending on the amount if you receive educational assistance benefits from your employer    under an educational assistance program you can exclude up to $    of those benefits each year this means your employer should not    include those benefits with your wages tips and other compensation    shown in box 1 of your form w-2 this also means that you do not have    to include the benefits on your income tax return source however your situation is a bit trickier since they are sort of retroactively paying for your education i 'd think the answer is maybe and you should consult a tax professional since it is a gray area   update on further research i 'm going to downgrade that maybe to probably not but hopefully soon the reason i am doing so is that there is a bill in congress specifically to allow what you are asking which presumes that you currently ca n't do this   the bill is hr bill the student loan employment benefits act of 2013 sponsored by rep steve israel d it has co sponsors from both parties so that is promising for it 's passage i suppose however it appears to be still early in the legislative process if this issue is near dear to your heart maybe you should call your congressman summary of the bill from student loan employment benefits act of 2013 the internal    revenue code to exclude from the gross income of an employee amounts    paid by an employer under a student loan payment assistance program    limits the amount of such exclusion to $ 5,000 in a taxable year requires an employer student loan payment assistance program to be a    separate written plan of an employer to provide employees with student    loan payment assistance   defines student loan payment assistance as    the payment of principal or interest on any indebtedness incurred by    an employee solely to pay qualified higher education expenses which    are paid or incurred within a reasonable time before or after such    indebtedness was incurred and are attributable to education furnished    during a period in which such employee was a student eligible for    federal financial assistance

that 's kind of the untold story of china everyone seems to think that all that they are about is cheap this and cheap that just a bit of a personal anecdote but i 'm a bit of a myself and on my first business trip to shanghai was able to have some tailored clothing made there   not only was the cut and finish as good or better than anything you 'd get in europe or n. america but the price was significantly less i quickly noticed that a lot of the chinese made garments selling locally were many times better than those imported ones bearing western brand labels even though they were also produced right there in china   so yes i am most definitely of the mind that the cheapness lack of quality of the products we have available to us in europe and n. america and made in china are a direct result of our own indigenous companies us so as to really up those margins suffice it to say they do in fact have quality control however if you want to pay them good money to make shit products they 'll surely oblige you

in general the short answer is to use sedar the canadian database that compiles financial statements for canadian companies the financial statements for pacific energy corp can be found here   the long answer is that the data might be missing because in canada each province has their own agency to regulate securities yahoo might not compile information from such a wide array of sources if other countries also have a decentralized system yahoo might not take the time to compile financial information from all these sources there are a myriad of other reasons that could cause this too however   this is why sedar is useful it 's the canadian equivalent of the sec 's edgar database and it maintains a sizeable database of financial statements

as someone that has run a nonprofit my 2 cents first thank you for giving and for being about wanting to make things as easy as possible the best method is the one you 'll actually do if there is a chance that you will end up not donating by check because you do n't have a stamp you forget etc go ahead and do it online a donation with a fee is better than an intention without one we had one case where a potential donor decided to give but was so worried about the processing fee that they wanted to write a check we followed up 3 times on the pledge spent time following up with the pledge 's connection that wanted to see if it came through and in the end they never sent the check their pledge wound up costing us staff time and money as we tried to make their giving easy   if you are as likely to give size matters my rule of thumb is that if you are giving $ 1 up to about a hundred dollars the fee which most nonprofits can get to about 3 or 3.5 is about the same as the added staff time opening the check adding an extra to the deposit slip etc but as soon as you are giving a couple hundred dollars and especially if you are giving in the thousands it is definitely better to do it by check most banks do n't charge an extra deposit fee at the scale of most nonprofits and we probably have some run to the bank happening in the next day or two really your thank you note should be the same whether online or by check even though you 'll get the auto thank you online so that time difference should n't really play into it the donation will be appreciated either way   while i cringe a bit if i see a $ 1,500 donation come through online knowing that the check would be cheaper that is far outweighed by the that someone thought of us and made it happen

if you 're looking for some formula i do n't think one exists people talk about this all the time and give conflicting advice if there was a proven accurate formula they would n't be debating it there are basically 3 reasons to do a home improvement project a correct a problem so that you prevent on going damage to your home for example have a leaking roof or replaced or such a job is worthwhile if the cost of fixing the problem is less than the cost of future damage in the case of my termite and leaking roof examples this is almost always worth doing lesser maintenance problems might be more debatable similarly some improvements may reduce expenses like replacing an old furnace with a newer model may cut your heating bills here the question is how long does it take to repay the investment compared to other things you might invest your money in just to make up numbers suppose you find that a new furnace will save you $ 500 per year if the new furnace costs $ 2000 then it will take 4 years to pay for itself i 'd consider that a good investment if that same $ 2000 furnace will only cut your heating bills by $ 100 per year then it will take 20 years to pay for itself you 'd probably be better off putting the $ 2000 into the stock market and using the gains to help pay your heating bill b increase the resale value of your home if you are paying someone else to do the work the harsh reality here is almost no job will increase the resale value by more than the cost of getting the job done i 've seen many articles over the years citing studies on this i think most conclude that kitchen remodeling comes closet to paying for itself and bathrooms come next new windows are also up there i do n't have studies to prove this but my guesses would be replacing something that is basically nice with a different style will rarely pay for itself like replacing oak cabinets with cherry cabinets replacing something that is in terrible shape with something decent is more likely to pay back than replacing something decent with something beautiful like if you have an old iron that 's and falling apart replacing it may pay off if you have a 5-year old that 's in good shape but is not premium top of the line replacing it with a premium will probably do very little for resale value if you can do a lot of the work yourself the story changes many home improvement jobs do n't require a lot of materials but do require a lot of work if you do the labor you can often get the job done very cheaply and it 's likely that the increase in resale value will be more than what you spend for example most of my house has hardwood floors lots of people like pretty hardwood floors i just the floors in two rooms it cost me i do n't know maybe $ 20 or $ 30 for stain and some i 'm sure if i tried to sell the house tomorrow i 'd get my twenty bucks back in higher sale value realtors often advise sellers to paint again if you do it yourself the cost of paint may be a hundred dollars and it can increase the sale price of the house by thousands of course if you do the work yourself you have to consider the value of your time c to make your home more pleasant to live in this is totally subjective you have to make the decision on the same basis that you decide whether anything that is not essential to survival is worth buying to some people a bottle of fancy imported wine is worth thousands even millions of dollars others ca n't tell the difference between a $ 10,000 wine and a $ 15 wine   the thing to ask yourself is how important is this home improvement to me compared to other things i could do with the money like suppose you 're considering spending $ 20,000 remodeling your kitchen what else could you do with $ 20,000 you could buy a car go on an elaborate vacation eat out several times a week for years retire a little earlier etc no one can tell you how much something is worth to you any given home improvement may involve a combination of these factors like say you 're considering that $ 20,000 kitchen remodeling say you somehow find out that this will increase the resale value by $ 15,000 if the only reason you were considering it was to increase resale value then it 's not worth it you 'd lose $ 5,000 but if you also want the nicer kitchen then it is fair to say okay it will cost me $ 20,000 but ultimately i 'll get $ 15,000 of that back so in the long run it will only cost me $ 5,000 is having a nicer kitchen worth $ 5,000 to me note by the way that resale value only matters if and when you sell the house if you expect to stay in this house for 20 years any improvements done are very long term investments if you live in it until you die the resale value may matter to your heirs

unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company which you would be working for there are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly and you should definitely consult an ria registered investment adviser before investing in something that is n't extremely standardized traded on an major exchange the issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized in terms of legal structure settlement terms registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are theoretically given specific training to understand these kinds of non standard investments and are theoretically qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these make well informed investment decisions and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme   there are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups what of the the company 's profits are you entitled to how long can the company go without paying you a dividend do they have to pay you a dividend at all how liquid will your investment in the company be unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business and other non standard contract clauses for example some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business this makes your investment essentially worthless the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend if you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either the probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow   overall the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned if you want to invest in companies on build a relationship with an ria and work with that person to invest your money it is easier less risky and not all that more expensive

you need an accountant and/or a lawyer who is familiar with the us tax code and the rules in south korea assuming from your tag as the interest will be money generated in the us you could be required to withhold some of the interest and remit it to the irs i believe 30 withholding rate since south korea is a treaty country your friend can complete and sign a form w8-ben and give it to you so you may withhold a lower amount your friend would need to file a return if too much was withheld they may also get taxed in south korea there are probably rules in south korea about minimum interest that must be charged similar to applicable federal rates for the us so check with your accountant or lawyer for this if you craft it correctly you will be able to have a loan as a mortgage with the house properly secured which then would allow you to deduct mortgage interest rates from your return as far as i am aware there is no maximum amount for loans

a few points that i would note call options could the bond be called away by the issuer this is something to note as some bonds may end up not being as good as one thought because of this option that gets used tax considerations are you going for corporate treasury or different ones may have different tax consequences to note if you are n't holding the bond in a tax advantaged account e.g roth ira ira or 401k convertible or not some bonds are known as since the bond comes with an option on the stock that can be worth considering for some kinds of bonds inflation protection some bonds like tips or series i savings bonds can have inflation protection built into them that can also be worth understanding in the case of tips there are principal adjustments while the savings bond will have a change in its interest rate default risk some of the higher yield bonds may have an issuer go under which is another way one may end up with equity in a company rather than getting their money back on the other side for some one could have the risk of the bond not quite being as good as one thought like some detroit bonds that may end up in a different result given their bankruptcy but there are also revenue bonds that may not meet their target for another situation that may arise some bonds may be insured though this requires a bit more research to know the credit rating of the insurer as for the latter question what if interest rates rise and your bond 's value drops considerably do you hold it until maturity or do you try to sell it and get something that has a higher yield based on face value

vesting as you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price   actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option   your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares the other have conditions attached the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future   when the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares dividends arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners i.e. the shareholders by selling goods and/or services at a profit   how does that money actually get to the shareholders   there are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one   periodically potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend   every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held so for example in 4 years or so after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company   if the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $ 20,000   depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this those are the basic concepts as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur but that 's hopefully enough to get you started

sorry this post is horribly misguided first of all any boat or yacht is a terrible investment the depreciation is horrendous secondly saying you lease as otherwise you ’re tying up capital stupidly is incorrect it depends on what your marginal cost of capital vs that of companies leasing when you lease you also compensate the lessor for its cost of capital if your cost of capital is less than that of the lessor then you would be stupid to get the lease you would be better off paying the out of pocket and borrowing it from the market yourself

who sets the prices effectively the market does like basically all openly traded things the greek government could well have said 5 is as high as we will go   as a result investors may not have chosen to buy the securities   the global bond market is highly liquid and investors who have a choice could well then choose to go elsewhere the reasons could well be varied but primary among them would be that investors view greek investments as more than 5 risky   if i can get 5 from a country that i deem less risky than from greece my choice is clear   therefore to be compensated for loaning them my money i am expecting a return of 7 because there is the possibility that they will default as for not selling them at all if they could avoid issuing bonds most governments would   they may not have had much of a choice   if they just print more money that does other potentially bad things to the economy   the government needs funds to operate if they are not collecting enough in taxes for example and do not want to print money as i mentioned then bonds are one other common way to raise cash notwithstanding that in your example you are referring to the interest rate not the price the principal is the same

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

here is what happened the company delivered a mattress so you owed them $ 600 they used a credit card company to get the payment from you so your money went to the credit card company which passed it on to the mattress company and you did n't owe anything for the mattress anymore the company should have refunded a small amount and should have asked the credit card company to refund a small amount say $ 20 just guessing so we have a number the credit card company instead refunded $ 600   that money is yours what happened there is just between you and your credit card company however since the mattress company now has n't received any money from you you still owe the mattress company $ 580 and they can ask you for that money for quite a long time once they get their act together probably two or three years

you should also consider what the cost of the put is especially if the strike price is set at the current price vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put and the expiration date   also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility there are a good number of situations where you may come out behind if the stock stays the same price you are out the premium you paid for the put if the stock price rises less than the premium you are out the difference between the two if the stock price falls less than the premium you are out the difference between the two in order to be in the money when writing a protective put the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put and you must sell or hold and write off the expense of the put or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower   than the premium you paid and you must sell via the exercising the option and you 've protected yourself from a loss presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers   and since selling is required in both cases if you 've held the stock less than a year then pay on any profits at short term rates taxed as regular income and if the price went down you ca n't claim any loss unless strike price was below your buy price and would still need to pay if you had a net gain and you likely ca n't deduct the price you paid for the put

the problem is that you do n't have the money now so they ca n't know with 100 certainty that you will have it on settlement day   what happens if you do n't file the paperwork in time or you change your mind because you think the company stock is going to go through the roof next quarter they would have to pull the funding for the loan the seller would be upset and could even file for damages if the deal falls through   it could even snowball because if they delay the sale then they ca n't buy the new place which impacts another closing frequently lenders want to see the money for the down payment long before settlement   they want to know the money is there and it is n't a hidden loan while you can point to the money in the espp they would still like to see the money in a regular bank account even if you do convince them to delay their evaluation you can count on being asked to prove the existence of the funds in the days before closing or they will delay giving the loan

maybe in that the government gets interest on the money it takes in and has to pay interest on the money it spends or has agreed to spend pensions etc so depending on which interest rate is higher the disadvantage shifts a little   it 's also not a question of things but a tax credit would be more like taking a cut in pay rather than spending more money thinking of it as spending tax money should only be a way of helping to show that it makes this disadvantage

the main disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for the interest only loan it 's higher risk to the bank since the principal outstanding is higher for longer   according to the new york times interest rates are usually an to a half percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans they 're also tougher to qualify for and fewer lenders offer them again due to the risk to the bank since you can always put extra towards the principal strictly speaking these are the only   downsides the upside of course is that you can make a lower payment each month the question is what are you doing with this if this is the only way you can afford the payments there 's a good chance the house is too expensive for you you 're not building equity in the home and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down if you 're using the money for other things or you have variable income it might be a different story for the former reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason if you 're cognizant of the risks for the latter salespeople on commission or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses can benefit from the flexibility

oh yeah   i used to rent a room from my buddy for awhile   he had an unused heated garage   he decided to remodel it ad a full bathroom and    this summer he made $ 4500 per month on airbnb rentals   he no longer needs roommates   this is only good for the few that have homes to rent out   it is a good idea that has gotten out of control   airbnb has been and will continue to drive up rental prices   the market ca n't handle these sort of price strains long term it is simply not sustainable for the average joe

the following is from wikipedia term life insurance with very minor editing because term life insurance is a pure    death benefit its primary use is to    provide coverage of financial    responsibilities for the insured    such responsibilities may include but    are not limited to consumer debt    dependent care college education for    dependents funeral costs and    mortgages term life insurance is    generally chosen in favor of permanent    life insurance because it is usually    much less expensive depending on the    length of the term many financial    advisors or other experts commonly    recommend term life insurance as a    means to cover potential expenses    until such time that there are    sufficient funds available from    savings to protect those whom the    insurance coverage was intended to    protect for example an individual    might choose to obtain a policy whose    term expires near his or her    retirement age based on the premise    that by the time the individual    retires he or she would have amassed    sufficient funds in retirement savings    to provide financial security for    their dependents this suggests the questions why do you have this policy also how many term life policies do you need or how much insurance do you need clearly you will be better off investing the premiums in the market   your beneficiaries may be better off either way depends when you die and to a lesser extent on market performance if you are not able to retire now but expect to be able to later you should strongly consider having sufficient insurance to provide income replacement for your spouse   this is a fairly common why

there 's not a single answer here as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors including but not limited to all these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident and the expected damage from an accident   so just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium all else being equal but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends obviously on how much your premium goes up which can not determined without all of the facts   your agent could tell you how much it would go up but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record and may cause your premium to go up although probably not by as much however the point of insurance is to reduce the out of pocket expenses from future accidents so the question to ask is how likely am i to have another accident and if i do can i pay cash for it or will i need to offset some cost with an insurance claim   do you risk making a claim and having your rates go up by more than $ 700 over the next 3 4 years the rough time it takes for a surcharge to expire   or do you just pay for the repair out of pocket and keep your premiums lower

unfortunately too many companies view a mail in rebate as an unwelcome cost instead of as a customer interaction issue and it gives the company a bad reputation when someone gets stiffed on the mail in rebate and it also has basically ruined the concept to a large degree many people will simply regard the rebate as worthless and evaluate the product based on the full price killing what the company wanted to get out of it rich seller hit the nail on the head which is why you see instant rebates etc

this is not a direct answer to your question but you might want to consider whether you want to have a financial planner at all would a large mutual fund company or brokerage serve your needs better than a bank you are still quite young and so have been contributing to iras for only a few years also the wording in your question suggests that your ira investments have not done spectacularly well and so it is reasonable to infer that your ira is not a large amount or at least not as large as what it would be 30   years from now at this level of investment it would be difficult for you to find a financial planner who spends all that much time looking after your interests that you should get away from your current planner presumably a mid level employee in what is typically called the trust division of the bank is a given   but to go to another bank or even to a different employee in the same bank where   you will also likely be towards investing your ira in cds annuities and a few mutual funds with substantial sales charges and   substantial annual expense fees might just take you from the pan into the fire you might want to consider transferring your ira to a large mutual fund company and investing it in something simple   like one of their low cost meaning small annual expense ratio index funds the couch potato portfolio suggests equal amounts invested in a no load s&p 500 index fund and a no load bond index fund or a split favoring the stock index fund in view of your age and the fact that the ira should be a long term investment   but the point is   you can open an ira account have the money transferred from your ira account with the bank and make the investments on line all by yourself instead of having a financial advisor do it on your behalf and charge you a fee for doing so not to mention possibly screwing it up you can set up automated investment too the mutual fund company will gladly withdraw money from your checking account and invest it in whatever fund(s you choose   all this is not complicated at all   if you would like to follow the couch potato strategy and rebalance your portfolio once a year you can do it   by yourself too if you want to invest in funds other than the s&p 500 index fund etc most mutual fund   companies offer a portfolio analysis and advice for a fee and the fee is usually waived when the assets increase above certain levels varies from company to company   you could thus have a portfolio analysis done each year and hopefully it will be free after a few more years   indeed at that level you also typically get one person assigned as your advisor just as you have with a bank once you get the recommendations you can choose to follow them   or not but you have control over how and where your ira assets are invested   over the years as your ira assets grow you can branch out into   investments other than index funds but right now having a financial planner for your ira might not be worth it later when you have more assets by all means if you want to explore investing in specific stocks with a brokerage instead of sticking to mutual funds only but this might also mean phone calls urging you to sell stock a right now or buy hot stock b today etc so one way of improving your interactions and have a better experience with your new financial planner is to not have a planner at all for a few years and do some of the work yourself

you say your primary goal is to clean up your credit report and you 're willing to spend some cash to do it    ok   but beware the law in this area is a mirror everything works upside down and backwards to start let 's be clear credit reports are not extortion to force you into paying they are a historical record of your creditworthiness and almost impossible to fix without altering history   paying on this debt will affirm the old data was correct and glue it to your report   here 's how credit reporting works for sent to collections amounts   the data is on your credit report for 7 years   the danger is in this clock being   what will not restart the clock   ignoring the debt talking to collectors and the debt being sold from one collector to another   what will restart the clock acknowledging the debt formally court judgment paying the debt or paying on the debt obviously paying the debt   crazy   you could have a debt that 's over 7 years old pay it because you 're a decent person and boom clock and 7 more years of bad luck   even if they write off or forgive any part of the debt that 's income and you 'll need to pay income tax on it   ugh   like i say the only way to remove a bad mark is to alter history simple fact    the collector does n't care about your bad credit mark he wants money and it costs a lot of money time and/or stress for both of you to demand they research it negotiate play phone tag and ultimately go to court   so this works very well this is just the guts you have to add all the who what where signature block formalities etc    1 company and customer absolutely disagree as to whether customer owes    company this debt explicitly named debt with numbers and amount 2 but company and customer both eagerly agree that the expense time and    stress of research negotiation and litigation is burdensome for both of us     we both strongly desire a quick final and no fault solution   therefore   3 parties agree customer shall pay company acceptable fraction here     payment within 30 days   to be acknowledged in writing by company   4 this shall be absolute and final resolution   5 no fault   parties agree this settlement resolves the matter in good faith    parties agree this settlement is done for practical reasons this bill has not been established as a valid debt and any difference between billed and settled amount is not a canceled nor forgiven debt   6 neither party nor its assigns will make any adverse statements to third parties relating to this bill or agreement   parties agree they have a continuous duty to remove adverse statements and agree to do so within seven days of request   7 parties specifically agree no adverse mark nor any mark of any kind shall be placed on customer 's credit report and in the event such a mark appears parties will it continuously   parties agree that a good credit report has a monetary value and specific impacts on a customer 's life   8 jurisdiction of law shall be where the effects are felt and that shall be place of service regarding the amounts of the bill proper   counterparts witness signature lines blah blah a collector is gon na sign this because it 's free money and it 's not tricky   what does this do   1 2 and 5 alter history to make the debt never have existed in the first place   to do this it must formally answer the question of why the heck would you pay a debt that is n't real and you do n't owe out of sheer practicality it 's cheaper than   this is your get out of jail free card both with the credit bureaus and the irs    of course 3 gives the creditor motivation to go along with it   6 says they ca n't burn your credit 7 says it again and they 're agreeing you can sue for cash money   8 lets you pick the court   the collector wo n't get hung up on any of these since he can easily remove the bad mark do n't be mad that they wo n't do it for free that 's what 3 is for   the key to getting them to take a settlement is to be reasonable and fair   make sure the agreement works for them too   6 says you ca n't them on social media 4 and 5 says it ca n't be used against them 8 throws them a bone by letting them sue in their home court for the bill they just settled a right they already had   if it 's medical add does not apply to this document to save them a ton of paperwork   make it easy for them you want the collector to take it to his boss and say this is pretty good do it   do n't send the money until their signed copy is in your hands   then send promptly with an for the receipt   make it easy for them   this is on you   as far as getting them to send you an offer creditors are reluctant to mail things especially to people they do n't think will pay because it costs them money to write and send   so you may need to be proactive about running them down with your offer   like i say it 's a mirror

to me the lower tax rate for capital gains is largely due to governments encouraging economic activity note that investments usually come from your normal income which is already taxed capital gains tax is essentially punishing people who take the extra effort to put their money into work if the tax rate is high it would definitely cause people to rethink about investing thus slowing the general economy down

i think your analysis is very clear it 's a sensible approach and the numbers sound about right to me a few other things you might want to think about tax in some jurisdictions you can deduct mortgage interest against your income tax i see from your profile that you 're in texas but i do n't know the exact situation there and i think it 's better to keep this answer general anyway if that 's the case for you then you should re run your numbers taking that into account you may also be able to make your investments tax advantaged for example if you save them in a retirement account you 'll need to apply the appropriate limits for your specific situation and take an educated guess as to how that might change over the next 30 years liquidity the money you 're not spending on your mortgage is money that 's available to you for other spending or emergencies i.e. even though your default assumption is to invest it and that 's a sensible way to compare with the mortgage you might still place some extra value on having more free access to it overpayments would you have the option to pay extra on the mortgage that 's another way of investing your money that gets you a guaranteed return of the mortgage rate you might want to consider if you 'd want to send some of your excess money that way

for press releases about economic data the bureau of economic analysis press release page is helpful depending on the series you could also look at the bureau of labor statistics press release page   for time series of both historical and present data the st. louis federal reserve maintains a database such data including numerous measures of gdp called fred they list nearly 15,000 series related to gdp alone fred is extremely useful because it allows you to make graphs that indicate areas of recession like this   on the series homepage there 's a bold link on the left side to download the data if you simply need the most recent data it 's listed below the graph on that page   if you 're interested in a more in depth analysis you can use the bureau of economic analysis as well specifically the national income and product accounts which are most of the numbers that feed into the calculation of gdp fred also archives some of these data both fred and the bea compile data on numerous other economic benchmarks as well   other general sources for a wide range of announcements are the yahoo bloomberg and the wall street journal economic calendars these provide the dates of many economic announcements e.g. existing home sales durable orders crude inventories etc yahoo provides links to the raw data where available bloomberg and the wsj provide links to their article where appropriate this is a great way to learn about various announcements and how they affect the markets for example the somewhat disappointing durable orders announcement recently pushed markets down a few points   for europe look at on the left side of the page they list links to common data including gdp they list the latest releases on the home page that i previously linked to   for the sake of keeping this question short i 'm the rest of the world into this paragraph data for many other countries is maintained by their governments or central banks in a similar fashion the world bank 's also has relevant data like gross national income which is n't identical to gdp but it 's another less common macroeconomic indicator   you can also look at the economic calendar on or xe.com which list events for the us europe and some latin american countries if you 're only interested in the us the bloomberg or yahoo calendars may have a higher signal to noise ratio but if you 're interested in following how global markets like currency markets respond to new information a global economic calendar is a must also has a global economic calendar that according to them is specifically geared towards events that affect the forex market   as i said governments and central banks compile a lot of this data so to make searching easier here are a few links to statistical agencies and central banks for major countries i compiled this list a while ago on my personal machine so although i think all the links are accurate leave a comment if something is n't quite right   statistics australia brazil canada canada china france germany imf japan mexico oecd thailand uk us central banks australia brazil canada chile china ecb hungary india indonesia israel japan mexico norway russia sweden switzerland thailand uk us

i really have to use the business card for personal expenses please assume that in your answer this is very hard to believe you must do that why not just have the company pay you $ 1600 each month then you can use that money for whatever you want why ca n't you do this i can not think of a legitimate reason how to integrate the personal expenses in company anyway to answer your question what i 've done when i accidentally used my corporate card for a personal expense is to code the expense as a payment to me similar to if a check had been written to me if you are n't ever paying yourself then you should just pay the company back the $ 1600 every month as a side note i highly recommend you do n't do this by doing this on a regular basis you are opening the door for piercing the corporate veil this means that the financial protections provided by the llc could potentially be stripped away since personal and corporate funds are being mixed the unfortunate end result is that personal assets could end up being fair game too in a judgement against the company even if you are n't an owner your relative could be considered to be using business money for personal expenses namely letting a relative spend business funds for personal use how to show more expenses and lessen the profit if you 're referring to the personal expenses then you absolutely do not want to do this that 's illegal and worthy of stiff penalties which possibly include jail time for tax evasion better to just have the company pay you and then the entire payment is deductible and reduces the profit of the company

yes you can buy to let mortgages are typically lent on a combination of expected rental income plus a part of the applicants other income they also at the moment usually require a fairly hefty deposit   the exact requirements are likely to have changed by the time you apply but in basic yes there is another option you can increase your mortgage on your currently property and buy the btl with cash this gives some more flexibility as you can move faster so is great for an auction purchase it is also often cheaper to mortgage your main property and you will get a lower rate of course to do this you will need sufficient equity in your main property and income to cover the mortgage repayments so the practicality of this depends on your main property value and the amount you need

i do n't think you are reading the stock chart right   has a beta of which means it has more volatility than the market as a whole   see image below for a fairly wild stock chart for a year    i would not truly consider espp participation investing unless you intend to buy and hold the stock   if you intend to sell the stock soon after you are able it is more speculation   espp 's are okay based upon the terms   if the stock was a constant price and you could sell right away then an espp plan would be easy money   often employees are often given a 15 discount to purchase the stock   if you can sell it before any price drop then you are guaranteed to make 15 on the money invested minus any commissions    some employers make espp participants hold the stock for a year   this makes such a plan less of a value   the reasons are the stock can drop in price during that time you could need the money or in the best case your money is tied up longer making the roi less the reasons people invest in stock are varied and is far to much to discuss in a single post   some of your colleagues are using the espp solely to earn the discount in their money

the first two answers to this are very good but i feel like there are a couple of points they left out that were a little too long for comments first off take a look at the expense percentage the load fees and the average turnover ratio for the funds in your retirement account assuming they are mutual funds having low expense fees < 1 preferably and turnover ratios will help tremendously because those eat into returns whether the value of the fund goes up or down the load fees either incoming or outgoing will lower the amount of money you actually put in and get out of the fund there are thousands of no load funds and most that have a backend load for taking the money out have clauses that lower that percentage to zero over several years it is mostly there to keep people from trying to swing trade with mutual funds and pull their money out too quickly   the last thing i would suggest is to look at diversifying the holdings in your account bond funds have been up this year even though the stock market has done poorly and they provide interest income that can increase the amount of shares you own even when the value of the bonds might have gone down

the benefit of paying into a pension is that the payment is effectively made from pre tax money either you pay from your own pocket and then you get income tax relief on the payment i.e. your gross salary is reduced by the gross pension contribution and income tax is recalculated with the excess either refunded to you or put in your pension the details are a bit more complicated depending on your marginal tax rate but the end result is the same or your company pays and then you are never charged tax on the payment in the first place from the company 's point of view the two are roughly the same either it pays you who then pays into your pension or it pays straight into your pension either way the money going out from the company is treated as a cost that is offset against the company 's revenue reducing the amount of corporation tax the company has to pay there are some national insurance advantages to paying directly into the pension neither you nor the company gets relief on ni if the payment goes via you but no ni is paid in the first place if it goes direct from the company edit your question is actually worded to suggest that you want to lend your company money from your own pocket and then have that loan directly discharged by the company paying into your pension that 's no different to you just paying into your pension directly and would n't have any better tax implications for the rest of my answer i assume that the idea is actually to lend your company money that it uses to make an immediate contribution to your pension as part of your pay from that company and then the company will repay the loan later by returning the money to you personally your pension and you are two separate entities legally however in your case what you 're proposing is that the company should effectively make a loss paying into your pension it 's going to end up with more costs than revenue so there wo n't be any immediate tax saving because there was n't revenue to pay corporation tax on in the first place you also wo n't save tax because the loan will be made from previously taxed income or whatever   however there will be a tax loss that can be carried forward and offset against future profits so if you expect the company to make money in future to repay the loan you might end up saving some corporation tax you can also sometimes carry a tax loss back one year so if your company had profits last year you could get some corporation tax back immediately the repayment of the loan itself wo n't be subject to income tax as it 's not income so unless you can carry the loss back you wo n't get any immediate tax relief by doing this but it might give you a way to carry forward your annual allowance to future years i.e. use it now and get the tax advantage later however the annual allowance can already be carried forward by up to three years so this is only worthwhile if you expect that future revenue to repay the loan to arrive more than three years later also this is only worthwhile if you 'll continue to max out the annual allowance for paying into your pension in future years otherwise you might as well just make the pension payment using that same revenue in future years however even if this beneficial tax wise i 'm not sure if it 's actually allowed this might be viewed as an artificial transaction to avoid tax and that could lead to hmrc the future tax relief you might need to ask hmrc or an accountant about that if you do make the loan make sure it 's clearly documented so you can show in future why the repayment should n't be treated as income

i do n't see how anyone could give you a hard and fast formula unless they know where to get some applicable statistics because several factors here are not a straight calculation if you do n't replace the tires but keeping driving the car what is the increased probability that you will get into an accident because of the bald tires how much will bald tires vs new tires affect the selling price of the car presumably the longer you drive the car after getting new tires the less increase this will give to the market value of the car what 's the formula for that if you keep the car what 's the probability that it will have other maintenance problems etc that said it 's almost always cheaper to keep your current car than to buy a new one even if you have maintenance problems it would have to be a huge problem to cost more than buying a new car suppose you buy a $ 25,000 car with what 's a typical new car loan these days maybe 5 years at 5 so your payments would be about $ per month if you compare spending $ 1000 for new tires versus paying $ per month on a new car loan the tires are cheaper within 3 months the principle is the same if you buy with cash to justify buying a new car you have to factor in the value of the pleasure you get from a new car the peace of mind from having something more reliable etc mostly intangibles

that argument is an argument for investing generally not peer to peer lending per se and the argument as phrased thus you should invest your money at a peer to peer loan platform is a false dichotomy that said as soon as one is investing as opposed to just getting a small but guaranteed return then risk comes into play   in that sense any savings account is fundamentally different from any investment and in that reading the two should n't be compared as different approaches to investing   peer to peer lending as an investment could be compared with stock market investing for one

things are generally fine   a credit balance is not a horrible thing    the argument against maintaining a credit balance is that you are essentially loaning the credit card issuer money at 0 interest   you probably have alternative investments that would pay better interest so it 's usually better to park your money there   all that said it 's unlikely that the interest on whatever balance you have is enough to be more than pennies    the way that a credit card works you run up a balance in one period   then there is a grace period   if you do n't pay off the balance during the grace period they start charging you interest   you also may have a minimum payment to make   if you do n't make that payment they 'll charge you a late fee    the typical period to rack up charges is from the first to the last day of a month   the typical grace period is through the 20th or 25th of the next month   your card may be different   so check the documentation user agreement for your card if you want the real data    it sounds like you paid off some purchases while you were still in the period where you rack up charges   while those purchases were posted to the account they may not be counted in the balance calculation   if your credit balance exactly matches the payment you made that 's probably what happened   it 's also possible that you overpaid the balance   if your credit balance is just a small amount that 's probably what happened    if you really want to be sure you should call the credit card issuer and ask them   at best we can tell you how it normally works   since this is your first month you could just wait for your first bill and respond to that   so long as you pay off the entire balance shown there by the deadline everything should be fine    do n't wait until the last day to pay   it 's usually best to pay a week or so early so as to leave time for the mail to deliver the check and for them to process it   you can wait longer for an online payment but a few business days early to give you a chance to handle potential problems is still good

i 'm surprised people do n't bring this up more often if you add together not just our sovereign debt but public and private debt plus our contingent liabilities meaning fha student loans fannie mae freddie mac aig etc   that totals over $ 100 trillion dollars more than we could ever pay back meaning literally there is no amount of growth and taxes that could ever pay this money back cite my sources do a google search of james lecture it 's in the first few minutes   the reason you need to add all that together is because the economy ca n't grow if nobody has any money for investment etc there is n't much home equity left after the housing crisis retirement plans are n't holding as much etc there would n't be an easy way to grow this economy that 's why we have currency wars competitive devaluations to me we 're already over the cliff i do n't see us heading back but i 'm not saying that means we 're going to collapse just we 'll need to go back to some sort of standard where our currency is backed by something i.e. commodities or gold or something and there are going to be a lot of losses in the near term meaning i want out of dollars   combined with our lazy entitled generation do n't tell me creating some website where you can order artistic candy on a stick is going to save our economy we need to produce and innovate again to lower our trade deficit and so people actually bring their capital here and dwindling resources i 'd say it 's already game over the pieces just need to move into place

here 's your problem the debt is valid and it is your debt regardless of your arrangement with the insurance company the insurance company possibly owes you money and you owe the doctor money you are stuck in the middle and in the end it does n't matter whether the insurance company pays as to whether you owe the money do n't ignore them also disputing the debt it pointless because the truth is that you do owe the debt the insurance company may owe you money which is in dispute but the debt to your medical provider is your own you are just stuck in the middle it sucks but is pretty common i think the best you can do is keep working on the insurance company and responding to the bill collectors letting them know that you are working on it and will need to pay late in theory they deal with this a lot and probably understand not that it will make them lay off you in the meantime   in the end it is possible you might have to sue the insurance company to get the money one thing to be careful about if the debt is fairly old several years you may want to avoid making partial payments because if this goes on your credit report that payment may extend the period where the negative information can appear on your credit history

most corporations have a limit on the number of shares that they can issue which is written into their corporate charter   they usually sell a number that is fewer than the maximum authorized number so that they have a reserve for secondary offerings employee incentives etc in a scrip dividend the company is distributing authorized shares that were not previously issued   this reduces the number of shares that it has to sell in the future to raise capital so it reduces the assets of the company in a split every share including the authorized shares that have n't been distributed are divided   this results in more total shares which then trade at a price that 's roughly proportional to the split but it does not reduce the assets of the company

buy and hold is still a winner an investor who used index funds and stayed the course could have earned satisfactory returns even during the first decade of the 21st century by by burton g. malkiel in the wall street journal on november 18 2010 the other useful technique is rebalancing keeping the portfolio asset allocation consistent with the investor 's risk tolerance for example suppose an investor was most comfortable choosing an initial allocation of 60 equities 40 bonds as stock and bond prices change these proportions will change as well rebalancing involves selling some of the asset class whose share is above the desired allocation and putting the money into the other asset class from 1996 through 1999 annually rebalancing such a portfolio improved its return by 1 and 1/3 percentage points per year versus a strategy of making no changes mr. malkiel is a professor of economics at princeton university this op ed was adapted from the upcoming 10th edition of his book a random walk down wall street out in december by norton

gt it 's very funny that you call an analysis of the current state of the industry speculation and then go on to talk about something you think is going to happen which by the way has had six years to happen and has n't yet also it 's as if you do n't think first mover advantage exists six years is a long time to build up a lead especially in automotive where product cycles and development times are so long   i freely admit that my opinion is just opinion speculation   anyone who talks about the stock market with certainty is someone not to listen to      gt honestly look up the words vertical integration before continuing the conversation and the word panasonic as well   i know all about them      gt but wait i thought you said they were wrong because actual battery companies are n't involved and that actual battery companies know better than them but i guess the actual battery companies do n't actually know anything and they should listen to an idiot on the internet who has so far proven himself to be wrong about everything he 's said   panasonic has n't yet agreed to put up a penny   they will build batteries they are confident tsla can sell that is all     gt it seems panasonic is not as optimistic about the plant as you are gt well again if you listened to the call which is a pretty basic first step to talking about the quarterly results which for some reason you insist on continuing to do despite being completely ignorant of them then you might not be saying such stupid things   like what   you are the one who insisted panasonic was putting up a billion dollars which is a lie    gt panasonic you see is a rather conservative japanese company this is even mentioned in your article when they talk about plasma displays this is why they are always measured in their public statements because that 's what japanese companies do but as specified in the call panasonic 's actions as a partner to tesla have always been excellent and if you actually bothered to read your own article you would see that they 've committed to 2 billion cells and 200 300 million for the factory you know an actual battery company   so tell me when they put up a dollar    gt and if you actually bothered to read any other article you would see that that very same quote of yours was followed up with however tesla is a very important partner to us and discussions are continuing we need to look very carefully at auto demand and respond appropriately so of course that means taking a step by step approach to investment   yes that is the polite thing anyone would say    gt also there have been rumors of talks with lg and samsung should panasonic not decide to partner i 'm not sure i believe the rumors and also i think they 're unnecessary because panasonic will be a full partner in the gigafactory they know that tesla has been a huge source of profit for them and their automotive supply i.e. tesla has been one of the best performing parts of their company for some time now mark my words panasonic 's investment will end up being approximately $ 1 billion all told you can come back in a few years and check if you like   we 'll see    gt you mean like an actual battery company the ones putting up the money   they have n't put up any money   gt so since your point was so reliant on actual battery companies having expertise and specialization and so on does that mean you 're now dropping that point because you realized your bullshit would n't fly and moving on to another sort of bullshit until one of them sticks because if you 'd like to fix your ignorance i can help you with that but if you would n't as seems to be the case it seems somewhat like a waste of time to continue trying to explain basic concepts to you   they have n't put up a penny   here is what people who know about batteries are saying

from time to time netflix plans and pricing are adjusted as we add more exclusive tv shows and movies introduce new product features and improve the overall netflix experience to help members find something great to watch even faster the spokesperson told   one of the big reason netflix is doing their own content is because the ever increasing price of securing television shows and the of it often contracts will be up and the provider decides not to renew   to include the cost of doing business in producing shows as an excuse to raise prices is little more than an excuse netflix is going to start spending less money retaining not netflix shows   just admit that costs are going up and netflix wants more money    one side note netflix produces a lot of good shows they also produce a lot of crappy shows that bomb a better quality control would help them save money

purchases and sales from the same trade date will both settle on the same settlement date they do n't have to pay for their purchases until later either because hft typically make many offsetting trades buying selling buying selling buying selling etc when the purchases and sales settle the amount they pay for their purchases will roughly cancel with the amount they receive for their sales the difference being their profit or loss margin accounts and just having extra cash around can increase their ability to have trades that do not perfectly offset in practice the hft 's broker will take a smaller amount of cash e.g. $ 1 million as a deposit of capital and will then allow the hft to trade a larger amount of stock value long or short e.g. $ 10 million for 10:1 leverage that $ 1 million needs to be enough to cover the net profit loss when the trades settle and the broker will monitor this to ensure that deposit will be enough

sorry i disagree they buy government bonds currently held by private banks who hold them for account holders this increased demand for government bonds means that the yield on them decreases this means the government can then borrow at a lower rate providing the qe is n't offset by a fall in private demand for bonds as they may be seen as in terms of the risk taken private investors will then turn to other investments offering a greater return this will then increase the capital stock available and expand output thus increasing employment

let me first start by defining an emergency fund this is money which is because emergency 's usually need to be deal with asap boiler breaks gears box in a car generally you need these to be solved as soon as possible because ou depend on these things working and you ca n't budget for this type of expenditure using just your monthly salary this is a personal opinion but i prefer investment types that do n't have another fee on access i really do n't like having another fee on top on money that i need right now investment options market based investments should be seen as long term investments therefore they do not really satisfy requirement one they can also have broker fees therefore you might pay a small extra charge for taking money out and so do not satisfy requirement two investment options for emergency funds you want to get the best return on your money even if it 's your emergency fund so use regular saving accounts but from you emergency fund or use tax effective savings accounts like a cash isa if based in the uk do n't think of an emergency money as just sitting there you have options just makes sure the options fit the requirements update given feedback i appreciate there are levels of emergency fund the above details things which might be about 1 2 month salary in cost car repairs leaks boiler repairs now i have another fund which is in p2p funds which is higher risk than a deposit account but then gives me a better return and is less subject to market fluctuations and it would be the place i go to for loss of job level emergencies say 6 months of salary this takes a bit longer to access but given i have the above emergency fund i have given myself time to get the money from the p2p account

absolutely   you can trace all of it back to reagan   his awful tax reform act of 1986 made corporate profits from operations in foreign countries tax exempt unless and until the corporations chose to repatriate those profits i.e. bring them back to the u.s. in which case they were subject only to a sharply reduced tax   this provision created the huge impetus for u.s. corporations to move their operations and their jobs overseas   reagan initiated the huge increase in income and wealth inequality

the risk reward relation depends on what you are changing in the most cases people ask about it is not linear but i will give examples of both nonlinear case 1   as you diversify your portfolio the firm specific risks of various stocks cancel each other out without necessarily affecting the expected return of the portfolio   reduction in risk without any loss in returns very nonlinear   nonlinear case 2 if you are changing the weights in your portfolio to move along the efficient frontier then you the risk reward relation is a which is nonlinear nonlinear case 3 if you are changing the weights in your portfolio to move away from the efficient frontier then you increase risk without adding a fully amount of return   there could be many paths along the risk reward plane but generally it will not be linear in the sense that it will not be on the same line as your initial efficient portfolio and your savings account linear case 1 the most common sense in which we think of the risk reward relation being linear is when the thing you are changing is the size of your investment   if you take money out of savings to put in your fully diversified portfolio without changing the relative weights your expected returns will increase linearly linear case 2 if you believe the capm then the expected return of an asset stock is linearly proportional to the market risk of the firm   if you could change the market risk of a single asset without changing anything else then you would linearly change its expected return the general rule about the risk reward relation is this if you are changing the size of your investment the relation is linear   if you are changing its composition the relation is nonlinear

when property changes hands the sale prices may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of the property and they may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of other properties because of the nature of the transaction you already have an existing business relationship the local government is likely to ignore the data point provided by your transaction when determining values of similar properties they have no idea if there was some other factor used to determine the price they will also not include in the calculation transactions that are a result of foreclosure becasue the target price is the loan value not the true value   california and some other jurisdictions do add another wrinkle you will need to determine if the transaction will trigger a of the property value in some states the existing laws of the state limited the annual growth of the assessment but that could now be recaptured if the jurisdiction rules that this is a new ownership california board of equalization change in ownership frequently asked questions how does a change in ownership affect property taxes each county assessor 's office reviews all recorded deeds for that    county to determine which properties require under the    law the county assessors may also discover changes in ownership    through other means such as taxpayer self reporting field    inspections review of building permits and newspapers once the    county assessor has determined that a change in ownership has    occurred proposition 13 requires the county assessor to reassess the    property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership    changed since property taxes are based on the assessed value of a property at    the time of acquisition a current market value that is higher than    the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base year value will    increase the property taxes conversely if the current market value    is lower than the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base    year value then the property taxes on that property will decrease only that portion of the property that changes ownership however is    subject to for example if 50 percent of the property is    transferred the assessor will reassess only 50 percent of the    property at its current fair market value as of the date of the    transfer and deduct 50 percent from any existing proposition 13 base    year value in most cases when a person buys a residence the entire    property a change in ownership and 100 percent of the    property is to its current market value
