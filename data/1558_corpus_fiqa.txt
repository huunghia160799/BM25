this may not exactly answer your question but as a small business owner i would highly recommend having a professional handle your taxes it is worth the money to have it done correctly rather than doing something wrong and getting audited or worse having penalties assessed and owing more than you thought would be possible i would recommend this especially if this is how you make your primary income you can always write it off as a business expense

i find the higher estimates a bit unbelievable a big part of my job is liability valuation and small assumption changes can have a huge impact on results   they may be right future dollar value wise but the proper way to think about this stuff is in present value terms   this could actually be a really interesting study you all just gave me a great idea for a potential masters thesis

to supplement existing answers the appraised value does not necessarily represent the net amount the bank could actually recover with a foreclosure let 's look at it from the point of view of the bank   suppose the property appraises at $ 200,000 and they do what you want loan you $ 200,000 with the property as collateral   now suppose a short time later you quit paying the mortgage and they have to foreclose   can the bank get their $ 200,000 back an appraisal is only an estimate nobody can predict perfectly how much a property will sell for   maybe the appraiser missed something significant and the property will only fetch $ 180,000 even if the appraisal was accurate when it was made property values may have dropped in the meantime   maybe a sudden economic crisis is driving real estate prices down across the board   maybe interest rates have spiked   maybe the county has changed the zoning regulations to locate a toxic waste dump next door to the property   in any of these cases the property may again fetch well under $ 200,000 maybe the condition of the property has changed   perhaps you trashed the place and it will take $ 30,000 to clean it up   people have a tendency to do things like that when they get foreclosed if the bank wants to get full market value for the property they will incur the usual costs of selling a property paying a real estate agent 's commission painting renting furniture to stage the property and so on   this will eat into the net amount they actually get from the sale it may take some time perhaps months for a property to sell at its full market value   during this time the bank is out $ 200,000   that 's money they would rather be loaning out at interest to someone else so this represents lost income foreclosing a mortgage is a fairly complicated procedure   the bank has to pay its staff including lawyers for a significant number of hours to get the foreclosure done   there will be court filing fees and so on   if you refuse to leave they may have to get the sheriff to evict you that has a fee as well   if you fight the foreclosure that racks up even more legal fees   this too eats into the net proceeds from the sale so if the bank loans you the full $ 200,000 they stand a pretty significant risk of not getting all of it back after expenses   you can understand that risk may not be worth the interest they would get from you on the extra $ 40,000 on the other hand if they loan you only 80 of the property 's appraised value $ 160,000 they effectively shift that risk onto you   should you default on the loan and they foreclose all they have to do is sell the property for $ 160,000 or a little bit more    that should n't be too hard even if it is not freshly painted or a bit trashed   they probably do n't need to hire a real estate agent just hold a quick auction maybe first calling up a few investors who might be interested in flipping it   if it happens to sell for more than the outstanding principal of the loan plus the bank 's costs then they will pay you the difference but they have no incentive to make that happen and every incentive to just get it sold quick   so any difference between the property 's true value and the actual sale price now represents a loss to you first not to the bank so you can see why the bank would rather not loan you the full value of the property   80 is a somewhat arbitrary figure but it cuts their risk by a lot

the amount reliability and frequency of dividends paid by an etf other than a stock such as an index or mutual fund is a function of the agreement under which the etf was established by the managing or issuing company or companies and the basket of investments that a share in the fund represents   let 's say you invest in a djia based index fund for instance dow diamonds dia which is traded on several exchanges including nasdaq and amex one share of this fund is currently worth $ jan 22 2014 while the djia itself is $ as of the same time so one share of the etf represents approximately 1 of the index it tracks the etf tracks the index by buying and selling shares of the blue chips proportional to total invested value of the fund to maintain the same weighted percentages of the same stocks that make up the index mcdonald 's for instance has an applied weight that makes the share price of mcd stock roughly 5 of the total djia value and therefore roughly 5 of the price of 100 shares of dia now let 's say mcd issued a dividend to shareholders of say $ .20 per share by buying 100 shares of dia you own through the fund approximately five mcd shares and would theoretically be entitled to $ 1 in dividends however keep in mind that you do not own these shares directly as you would if you spent $ 16k buying the correct percentage of all the shares directly off the exchange you instead own shares in the dia fund basically giving you an interest in some investment bank that maintains a pool of blue chips to back the fund shares whether the fund pays dividends or not depends on the rules under which that fund was set up the investment bank may keep all the dividends itself to cover the expenses inherent in managing the fund paying fund management personnel and floor traders covering losses versus the listed price based on bid ask parity etc or it may pay some percentage of total dividends received from stock holdings however it will virtually never cut you a check in the amount of your proportional holding of an indexed investment as if you held those stocks directly in the case of the dia the fund pays dividends monthly at a yield of virtually identical to the actual weighted djia yield but lower than the per share mean yield of the dji 30 2.78 differences between index yields and etf yields can be reflected in the share price of the etf versus the actual index 100 shares of dia would cost $ versus the actual index price of a delta of $ or from the actual index price that difference can be attributed to many things but fundamentally it 's because owning the dia is not the exact same thing as owning the correct proportion of shares making up the djia however because of what index funds represent this difference is very small because investors expect to get the price for the etf that is inherent in the real time index

it surely does n't hurt to keep a receipt i tend to pile up receipts in my desk drawer never look at them and then every few months throw them all out if a vendor writes a receipt by hand or if the cash register is not tied in to the credit card system keeping a receipt could give you evidence against mistakes or fraud like if the vendor gives you a receipt for $ 10 and then sends a transaction to the credit card company for $ 20 you could use the receipt as evidence of the problem but if the vendor is trying to really cheat you the most likely thing for him to do is run the legitimate transaction through and then some time later run a fake transaction so say today you go to vendor x buy something for $ 20 and he bills your credit card $ 20 then a few days later he bills you another $ 100 even though you never came back to the store sure you have a receipt for $ 20 but you do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 because you never authorized that transaction your receipt proves nothing presumably you 're not disputing the $ 20 if you complain to the bank or go to the police or whatever saying hey look i do n't have a receipt for the $ 100 does n't prove anything how do they know you did n't just throw it away it 's difficult to prove that you never had such a receipt

what i want to know is   how much does all this competition advertising marketing etc etc actually increase how much people give as a total yearly sum of their earning   if 40 cents on the dollar is spend advertising and collecting more money sure it works on the scale of a single successful charity what is the cost to charities as a whole though   if someone gives away 2,000 a year to charity and 19 charities all spend $ 100 chasing that $ 2000 dollars they on average can prove they are making money by spending to get that $ 100 more but in reality now instead of being able to give $ 2000 to the needy the person was actually only able to give $ 100   that is my fear when we start having charities operate as big business

is that an fha loan you have and you 're wanting to do one of those low cost fha re fi 's right the answer is that in between when you first got that loan and now the government 's changed the rules on pmi for fha loans it more than doubled the amount of monthly pmi you have to pay   the new rates april 18th 2011 as as follows it used to be 0.50 per year for the 30 year so that 's why the pmi would go up   there is another rule in play too specific to that no cost fha refi the government requires that the combined monthly payment after the refi is at least 4 lower than the current payment note that the no cost refi does not require a new appraisal   some options present themselves but only if you can show some equity in a appraisal 1 if an appraisal shows at least 10 equity you can go refi to a standard mortgage you might even be able to find one that does n't require pmi at that level if you have 20 equity you 're golden no pmi 2 see what the monthly payment will be if you refi to the 15 year fha mortgage between the much lower pmi and the much lower interest rates 15 year is usually about 0.75 less than a 30 year it might not be much more than what you 're paying now and you 'd save a huge amount of money over time and get out from that pmi much earlier it stops when your principal drops below 80 of the loan amount this would require that

your first step should be to visit with the financial aid office of the university that you are considering attending perhaps even before filling out the fafsa you may be eligible for grants scholarships and subsidized loans as well as unsubsidized loans you should pursue the first two options first and then when you know how much remains to be financed we can evaluate which of your investments you might liquidate if further financing is needed there are a range of views on debt on this board i take a very cautious approach to going in to debt i worked full time and took night classes to finish my degree without debt but depending on your program that might not be an option it seems that you also have a healthy relationship with debt considering the shape of your savings and finances as outlined above apart from the above information about how much money could be obtained and at what interest rates the other missing information is your current salary and your expected salary range after completing the program with all of that information i could make specific recommendations but at this point my only recommendation is to avoid liquidating any retirement accounts in your effort to invest in yourself if at all possible

what are the consequences if i ignore the emails if you ignore the emails they will try harder to collect the money from you until they give up unlike what some other people here say defaulting on a loan is not a crime and is not the same as stealing there is a large number of reasons that can make someone unable to pay off a loan lenders are aware of the risk associated with default they will try to collect the debt but at the end of the day if you do n't have money assets there is not much they can do    as far as immigration goes there is nothing on a form that asks you about bankruptcies or unpaid obligations i doubt the officer will know of this situation but it is possible it is not grounds for visa however so you will be fine if everything else is fine the only scenario in which unpaid student loans can come up relevant in immigration to the us is if and when you apply for us citizenship one of the requirements for citizenship is having good moral character having a large amount of unpaid debt constitutes evidence of a poor moral character but it is very unlikely you 'd be denied citizenship on grounds of that alone   i got a social security number when i took up on campus jobs at the school and i do have a credit score can they get a hold of this and report to the credit bureaus even though i do n't live in america yes they probably already have   how would this affect me if i visit america often does this mean i would not ever be able to live in america no see above you will have a hard time borrowing again   will they know when i come to america and arrest me at the border or can they take away my passport no unpaid debt is no grounds for so even if the cbp agent knows of it he will not do anything and again unpaid debt is not a crime so you will not be arrested

i would say that the three most important skills are note that some costs are hidden so for example a mutual fund investing in other countries than where you live in may mean the investment target country charges a certain percentage of dividends going to the mutual fund the mutual fund company does n't usually want to tell you this there may be clever financial instruments derivatives that can be used to avoid this but they are not without their problems if you diversify into equities at low cost you will have a very wealthy future i would recommend you to compare two options and pick from these options the cheaper one if your time has a high value and you wish to take this value into account i would say it is almost always far better option to choose an index fund whatever you do do n't pay for active management it is a mathematical truth that before costs actively managed investments will yield the same return than indexed investments however the costs are higher in active management so you will have less total return do n't believe that good historical return would imply good future return however if for some reason you see an index fund that continuously loses to the index more than by the amount of stated costs beware

as with everything else it 's a question of trade offs pros for buying in bulk cons for buying in bulk inventory cost you need to purchase more shelving to stock the goods   this is a real cost the psychological effect of having more means you are more likely to use more thus costing you more deflation of the cost of the item should occur over time in a well functioning market economy   a $ 10 item today might be $ 9.50 in one year in real terms there is a real opportunity cost associated with   granted an extra $ 100 in your bank account wo n't be earning too much if you have to spend it one month later but it does mean you have less financial independence for that month risk of spoilage   there is a nonzero risk that your goods could be ruined by flood fire damage you need to decide which of these pros and cons are more important to you   financially you should only buy what you need between shopping trips   in reality the convenience of holding goods in storage for when you need them may outweigh the costs

obviously these numbers can never be absolute simply because not all the information is public any statistic will most likely be biased i can tell you the following from my own experience that might get you closer in your answer hence even though i can not give you exact numbers i fully agree that traders can not beat the index long term if you add the invested time and effort that is necessary to follow an active strategy then the equation looks even worse   mind you active trading and active asset allocation aaa are two very different things aaa can have a significant impact on your portfolio performance

why is a home loan mortgage cheaper than gold loan it has to do with risk lending money secured by gold is inherently riskier than a loan secure by your home increased risk means the lender must charge more that 's why home loans are cheap compared to loans for other purposes home loans are secured by the house houses are assets that hold and usually retain some value houses are easy to track down they ca n't be hidden or moved in the event that you do n't repay your loan houses are reasonably liquid they can be resold to pay off a defaulted loan

depends on how long you 're willing to invest for broadly speaking the best by which i mean more reliably repeatable way to make money from market corrections is to accept them as a fact of life and not sell in a panic when they happen such that the money you already invested can ride back up again put another way just invest your money in one or two broad low cost index funds with dividends reinvested maybe spreading your investment over the course of six months or so and then let time do its work have you worked out how much you 've missed out on by holding your money as cash all this time i presume you 've been saving up a while instead of investing it as you went i suspect that by waiting for your correction you 've already missed out on more than you 're going to make from that correction

the hst is a sales tax levied on most goods and services it is important to realize that in both bc and ontario the new hst does not in most cases result in an increase in sales tax paid for example in ontario the pst is 8 and when combined with the gst the sales tax is 13 with the hst the gst and pst are replaced by a single hst of 13 so the tax bill does not change some services that were previously not subject to pst such as mutual fund service fees and labour will now be subject to the hst so some things will increase over time this should not have a material impact on the consumer due to the way businesses remit gst hst

long convexity is achieved by owning long dated low delta options when a significant move occurs in the underlying the volatility curve will move higher instead of a linear relationship between your long position and it 's return you receive a multiple of the linear return for example share price $ 50 long 1 equals 100 shares contract of a 2 year 100 call assume this is a 5 delta option if the stock price rises to $ 70 the delta of the option will rise because it is now closer to the strike lets assume it is now a 20 delta option then   expected return on a $ 20 price move higher 100 however what happens is the entire volatility surface rises and causes the 20 delta option to be 30 delta option then the return on a $ 20 price move higher 100 this $ 200 extra gain is due to convexity and explains why option traders are willing to pay above the theoretical price for these options

an investment portfolio is typically divided into three components all three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or etfs a 401(k will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one look at the prospectus for the expense ratio if it 's over 1 you 're definitely paying too much if it 's over 0.5 you 're probably paying too much if it 's less than 0.1 you have a really good deal us stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement or get close to spending the money on something else if it 's not invested for retirement international stocks are riskier than us stocks but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the us stocks bonds or fixed income investments are generally very safe but have limited opportunities for returns they tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly when you 've got a while to invest you should be looking at riskier investments when you do n't you should be looking for safer investments a quick and rough rule of thumb is that your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds so if you 're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so you should have about 50 in bonds roughly   people whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there because they already are at risk if it performs badly for instance if you work in the technology sector loading up on tech stocks is extra risky if there 's a big bust you 're not just out of a job your portfolio is dead as well more exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio while many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them

hard pulls you give your explicit permission to run do affect your credit   soft pulls do not while hard pulls affect your score they do n't affect it much   maybe a couple few point for a little while   in your daily activities it is inconsequential   if you are prepping to get a mortgage you should be mindful similar type hard pulls in a certain time window will only count once because it is assume you are shopping   for example mortgage shopping will result in a lot of hard pulls but if they are all done in a fortnight they only count against once   i believe the time window is actually a month but i have always had two weeks in my head as the safe window the reason soft pulls do n't matter is because businesses typically wo n't make credit decisions based on them   a soft pull is so a business can find a list of people to make offers to but that does n't mean they actually qualify   only the information in a hard pull will tell them that   i do n't know but i suspect it is more along the lines of give me everybody who is between 600 and 800 and lives in zip code not what is 's credit score a hard pull will lower your score because of a scenario where you open up many many lines of credit in a short period of time   the credit scoring models assume i am guessing that you are going to implode   you are either attempting to cover obligations you ca n't handle or you are about to create a bunch of obligations you ca n't handle credit should be used as a convenient method of payment not a source of wealth   as such each credit line you open in a short time lowers the score   you are to continue opening lines and lenders at the end of your credit line opening spree will see you as riskier than the first

first thing to do right now is to see if there 's somewhere equally liquid equally risk free you can park your cash for higher rate of return you can do this now and decide how much to move into less liquid investments on your own pace when i was in grad school i opened a roth ira these are fantastic things for young people who want to keep their options open you can withdraw the contributions without penalty any time the earnings are tax free on retirement or for qualified withdrawls after five years down payments on a first home qualify for example as do medical expenses or you can leave it for retirement and you 'll not pay any taxes on it so roth is pretty flexible but what might that investment look like it in depends on your time horizon five years is pretty short so you probably do n't want to be too stock market weighted just recognize that safe short term investments are very poorly rewarded right now however you can only contribute earnings in the year they are made up to a 5000 annual maximum and the deadline for 2010 is gone so you 'll have to move this into an ira over a number of years and have the earnings to back it so in the meanwhile the obvious advice to pay down your credit card bills save for emergencies applies it 's also worth looking at health and dental insurance as college students are among the least likely to have decent insurance also keep a good chunk on hand in liquid accounts like savings or checking for emergencies and general poor planning you do n't want to pay bank fees like i once did because i mis timed a money transfer it 's also great for negotiating when you can pay in cash up front my car insurance for example will charge you more for monthly payments than for every six months or putting a huge chunk down on a car will pretty much guarantee the best available dealer financing

now you 're just splitting hairs on definition   the definition of globalism and by extension globalist differs based on source and context     other possible definitions   the attitude or policy of placing the interests of the entire world above those of individual nations   globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization it tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration and global governance economically globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to marxist it is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries such as the united states   political globalization is when governmental action takes place on a global level where responsibilities such as the welfare of citizens and economic growth are acted upon by an international political body   globalism in a political discourse is opposed to nationalism and has very little to do with business owning interest in other nations other than the repercussions vis a vis tariffs and taxes

if the check is written as a check to bigco it is less clear how jack can compensate himself for the equity sale it is as if the equity was owned by the corporation not by jack this is correct   if the check is written to bigco then it is bigco issuing new shares   jack does n't compensate himself for the equity sale as he did n't sell anything   the company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion   in the long term the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $ 200,000 no interest loan to the company    if the value of the company before investing $ 250,000 is $ 1 million then the value after investing is $ 1.25 million   so $ 250,000 is 20 of the value of the company   bigco should not give the buyer 25 of bigco but only 20 in that example   if it does give 25 the buyer is getting a $ stake for only $ 250,000    with the other example jack sells 25 of the company for $ 250,000 from his personal shares   this does n't change the assessed value of the company just jack 's stake   jack then loans the company $ 200,000   this also does n't change the assessed value of the company at least in theory   it gains $ 200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $ 200,000   in net that 's no change   assets and liabilities balance the same    so if you know that the assessed value of the company is $ 1 million and that the buyer is paying $ 250,000 for a 25 stake at that same valuation then you know that the check is being written to jack   if the check is written to bigco then one or more of those numbers is incorrect    the buyer could be getting a 20 stake   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1.25 million    or paying $   the new value of the company after the investment is $    or bigco could only be worth $ 750,000 before the investment   the new value of the company after the investment is $ 1 million    or jack is getting screwed selling $ in stock 25 for only $ 250,000   jack 's shares drop from being worth $ 1 million to only $   the value of the company is $ 1.25 million    or some combination of smaller changes that balances

to answer my own question at least to the extent of my understanding here the irs says that all income for a foreign person from a us based company is taxable with 30 here the irs says that this tax should be withhold at source by whomever pays you in case there is a tax treaty with the country the tax can even be waived in the us of course if you do n't declare it in your home country the us bank could probably give information requested by the home country authorities for the other two cases when there 's no us party involved i ca n't find anything on the irs website which kind of make sense if i am using an account in the us just to receive and send money should n't imply any tax thanks to for pointing me into the right direction

the broker that is issuing the moneys after vesting is more than likely deducting a notional amount of tax and ni based on uk income tax laws if you are not a uk resident then you should pay income tax on those stock options based on your own tax residency best thing to do is speak directly with the broker to explain the situation ask them to not deduct anything from your stock options but keep in mind that you will need to declare these earnings yourself and pay the correct rate of tax from my own personal experience the uk employer more than likely receives the net value after the notional tax and ni have been deducted and in usual circumstances create a tax liability on your payslip if you were working and had earnings if of course this deduction is being made by the employer then you can simply ask them to correct this most uk payroll software will automatically deduct tax and ni for payments after leaving unless manually so they probably are n't aware if it is them doing so

short answer the cd can be considered as part of the down payment calculations they will want a plan to cash them in the last days or weeks before settlement when approving you for a mortgage they will be looking at they now know what you can afford to dedicate to this new property every month they take into account principal interest taxes insurance and the hoa fee they will then look at how much money you will use as a down payment they want this money to exist before applying and they will check on its existence in the last days before settlement   the best is cash sitting in a bank but it can also be money in savings bonds or a cd but they will want a plan for cashing that in just before settlement   they wo n't be comfortable with it being in a volatile account such as stocks especially if the current balance is exactly what you need for a mortgage that wo n't be closed for 3 more months because people use money they borrow from their 401 k for a home purchase it is possible to use money from volatile account they will want to see a plan for getting money from these accounts just before settlement

from a federal tax point of view withdrawals from 529 plans are treated as taxable unless they are used on qualified expenses the part of a distribution representing the amount paid or contributed    to a qtp does not have to be included in income this is a return of    the investment in the plan the designated beneficiary generally does not have to include in    income any earnings distributed from a qtp if the total distribution    is less than or equal to adjusted qualified education expenses    defined under figuring the taxable portion of a distribution    later to determine if total distributions for the year are more or less than    the amount of qualified education expenses you must compare the total    of all qtp distributions for the tax year to the adjusted qualified    education expenses you 'll have to include them in your income and pay normal income tax on them and also in most cases pay an extra 10 penalty generally if you receive a taxable distribution you also must pay a    10 additional tax on the amount included in income you 'd have to check on the situation from a state perspective but i 'd imagine it 's quite similar the basic point is that non qualified distributions are treated as earnings

exactly what accounts are affected by any given transaction is not a fixed thing just for example in a simple accounting system you might have one account for stock on hand in a more complex system you might have this broken out into many accounts for different types of stock stock in different locations etc so i can only suggest example specific accounts but account type asset liability capital or equity income expense should be universal debit and credit rules should be universal 1 sold product on account you say it cost you $ 500 to produce you do n't say the selling price but let 's say it 's oh $ 700 credit decrease asset stock on hand by $ 500 debit increase asset accounts receivable by $ 700 credit increase income sales by $ 700 debit increase expense cost of goods sold by $ 500 2 $ 1000 spent on wedding party by friend i 'm not sure how your friend 's expenses affect your accounts are you asking how he would record this expense did you pay it for him are you expecting him to pay you back did he pay with cash check a credit card bought on credit i just do n't know what 's happening here but just for example if you 're asking how your friend would record this in his own records and if he paid by check credit decrease asset checking account by $ 1000 debit increase expense wedding expenses by $ 1000 if he paid with a credit card credit increase liability credit card by $ 1000 debit increase expense wedding expenses by $ 1000 when he pays off the credit card debit decrease liability credit card by $ 1000 credit decrease asset cash by $ 1000 or more realistically there are other expenses on the credit card and the amount would be higher 3 issue $ 3000 in stock to partner company i 'm a little on this i have n't worked with the stock side of accounting but here 's my best stab well did you get anything in return like did they pay you for the stock i would n't think you would just give someone stock as a present if they paid you cash for the stock debit increase asset cash credit decrease capital shareholder equity anyone else want to chime in on that one i 'm a little shaky there here let me give you the general rules my boss years ago described it to me this way you only need to know three things to understand double entry accounting 1 there are five types of accounts assets anything you have that has value like cash buildings equipment and merchandise includes things you may not actually have in your hands but that are rightly yours like money people owe you but have n't yet paid liabilities anything you owe to someone else debts merchandise paid for but not yet delivered and taxes due capital some call it capital others call it equity the difference between assets and liabilities the owners investment in the company retained earnings etc income money coming in the biggest being sales expenses money going out like salaries to employees cost of purchasing merchandise for resale rent electric bill taxes etc okay that 's a big one thing 2 every transaction must update two or more accounts each update is either a debit or a credit the total of the debits must equal the total of the credits 3 a dollar bill in your pocket is a debit with a little thought okay sometimes a lot of thought you can figure out everything else from there

one reason is that it is not possible at vanguard and at many other brokerages to auto invest into etfs   because the etf trades like a stock you typically must buy a whole number of shares   this makes it difficult to do auto investing where you invest say a fixed dollar amount each month   if you 're investing $ 100 and the etf trades for $ 30 a share you must either buy 3 shares and leave $ 10 or buy 4 and spend $ 20 more than you planned   this makes auto investing with dollar amounts difficult   it would be cool if there were brokerages that handled this for you for instance by accumulating leftover cash until an additional whole share could be purchased but i do n't know of any a difference of 0.12 in the expense ratios is real but small   it may be outweighed by the psychological gains of being able to adopt a hands off auto investing plan   with etfs you generally must remember to manually buy the shares yourself every so often   for many average investors the advantage of being able to invest without having to think about it at all is worth a small increase in expense ratio   the 0.12 savings do n't do you any good if you never remember to buy shares until the market is already up

i do n't know why there is so much confusion on such a simple concept the answer is very simple a stock must eventually pay dividends or the whole stock market is just a cheap ponzi scheme a company may temporarily decided to reinvest profits into r&d company expansion etc but obviously if they promised to never pay dividends then you can never participate in the profits of the company and there is simply no intrinsic value to the stock for all of you saying yeah but the stock price will go up please people get a life the only reason the price goes up is in anticipation of dividend yield otherwise why would the price go up   but the company is worth more and the stock is worth more a stocks value is not set by the company but by people who buy and sell in the open market   to think a stock 's price can go up even if the company refuses to pay dividends is analogous to person a says hey buy these paper clips for $ 10 but those paper clips are n't worth that it does n't matter because some fool down the line will pay $ 15 but why would they pay that because some fool after him will pay $ 20 ha ha

the setting of interest rates or repurchase rates varies from country to country as well as with the independence of the central bank there are a number of measurements and indices that central bankers can take into account this is a limited overview but should give an indication of just how complex tracking inflation is let alone attempting to control it   house prices are in the mix but which house or which price the choice of what to measure faces the difficulty of attempting to find a basket which really affects the majority regularly and not everyone is buying several new houses a year so the majority are ring from fluctuations in prices at the capital end but not from the interest rate end and this is only when the various agencies statistics central bank labour etc are independent   in countries like venezuela or argentina government has taken over release of such data and it is frequently at odds with individual experience links for the us and for australia

pay off the highest interest loan rate first you must be doing something funky with how long your terms are if you give a bit more info about your loan 's such as the term and how much extra you have right now to spend it could be explained in detail why that would be the better choice using your numbers you have to make sure when you are analyzing your different loan options that you make sure you are comparing apples to apples ie make sure that you are either comparing the present value future value or amortization payments   edit using some of your numbers lets say you have 5000 dollars in your pocket you have 3 options excel makes these calculations easier do nothing in 80 months your student loan will be payed in full and you will have owing on your mortgage and 5000 in your no bank interest   for mortgage pay off student loan and allocate student loans amortization to mortgage in 80 months you will have $ owing on mortgage and student loan will be paid in full for mortgage pay 5000 on mortgage in 80 months student loan will be paid in full and you will have $ owing on mortgage for mortgage

yes   it does cost the same to pay off a 15 year in 15 year versus a 30 year in 15 year mortgage   after all the 30 year amortization period is only used by the lender to calculate the monthly payment he 'll expect while to him you are using a 15 year amortization and the same rate to calculate the payments you 'll really make one factor   can you make extra payments at the level you want without incurring penalties from the lender   most mortgages have prepayment limits   after all he 's seeing his nice steady 30 years of cash flow suddenly shortened   he has to go out and find someone else to lend the unexpected payments to edit   closed mortgages with pre payment charges are the norm here in canada   open mortgages in the us

what drives the stock of bankrupt companies such stock is typically considered distressed assets   technically what drives it is what drives every stock supply and demand a more interesting question is of course why would there be demand first who the buying pressure on the stock typically three types of entities the largest ones are financial institutions specializing in distressed assets frequently alternatives specialists hedge funds private equity firms etc usually they invest in distressed debt or distressed preferred equity but sometimes distressed equity as well why we will discuss their motivations separately in this answer second one are existing equity holders   why short answer behavioral psychology and behavioral economics many investors especially non professionals insist on holding distressed stocks due to variety of investment fallacies sunk cost etc usually constructing elaborate theories of why and how the company and the stock will recover sometimes people who buy into penny stock scams pump and dump schemes etc why there 's a sucker born every minute let 's find out why an investment professional would invest in distressed equity first the general process is always the same company 's assets are used to pay off its liabilities in accordance with applicable law there are two ways this can be done either through selling the company or through bankruptcy process the liabilities are paid according to seniority the seniority priorities rules are covered by 11 u.s. code priorities a company in bankruptcy can have one of 2 outcomes buyout some buyer might decide that the company 's assets are worth something to them as a whole and buy the whole enterprise rather than risk it being destroyed piecemeal in bankruptcy proceedings in that case the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the liabilities as discussed above this option is one of the possible reasons people might consider investing in distressed equity   for example if the company is in bankruptcy because it ca n't get enough financing right now but is likely to have good profits in the future the chances are some buyer will buy it for a premium that includes those future profits and that sale amount might possibly exceed the liabilities bankruptcy the assets are sold and liabilities are covered according to priorities in that case the investors in distressed equity might be hoping that there are un obvious assets whose value would also put the total assets above claimed liabilities additional possible beneficial factor is that unsecured debtors must file with the court in order to be paid and the claim must be validated some might fail on either count so total amount of liabilities might lessen once the bankruptcy process goes through assets now here 's where things get interesting of course companies have usual assets real estate inventory plants cash etc these are all able to be sold to cover liabilities and at first glance are possibly not enough to cover liabilities leaving equity holders with nothing and even that 's not a certainty bankruptcy is simply inability to service debt payments and while it correlates to assets not full asset valuation but some assets are less sure and are thus rarely included in such calculations these may include chances of winning appeals if specific existing liabilities are results of litigation e.g. tax appeals court judgement appeals etc and lawsuits against former executives especially in cases where the company 's financial distress resulted from executive malfeasance i was personally involved in one such case as an equity holder where the company assets were valued at $ x had liabilities of $ but had a real possibility of winning about $ in a lawsuit against former ceo accused of various malfeasance including fraud and insider trading as such the best case scenario was literally 100 profit on holding that distressed equity

debt increases your exposure to risk   what happens if you lose your job or a major expense comes up and you have to make a hard decision about skipping a loan payment   being debt free means you are n't paying money to the bank in interest and that 's money that can go into your pocket debt can be a useful tool however   it 's all about what you do with the money you borrow   will you be able to get something back that is worth more than the interest of the loan a good example is your education   how much more money will you make with a college degree   is it more than you will be paying in interest over the life of the loan   then it was probably worth it instead of paying down your loans can you invest that money into something with a better rate of rate of return than the interest rate of the loan   for example why pay off your 3 student loan if you can invest in a stock with a 6 return   the money goes to better use if it is invested   note that most investments count as taxable income so you have to factor taxes into your effective rate of return the caveat to this is that most investments have at least some risk associated with them   stocks do n't always go up   you have to weigh this when deciding to invest vs pay down debts   paying down the debt is more of a sure thing another thing to consider if you have a long term loan several years paying extra principal on a loan early on can turn into a huge savings over the life of the loan due to power of compound interest   extra payments on a mortgage or student loan can be a wise move   just make sure you are paying down the principal not the interest   and check for early repayment penalties

if the market rate and coupon were equal the bond would be valued at face value by definition not 100 true but this is an exercise and that would be tangent to this discussion   since the market rate is higher than the coupon rate the value i am willing to pay drops a bit so my return is the same as the market rate   this can be done by hand a time value of money calculation for each payment discount by the years till received at the market rate to get the present value for each payment and sum up the numbers   the other way is to use a finance calculator and solve for rate   the final payment of $ 10,000 ignore final coupon just now is $ ^ 5 in other words that single chunk of cash is worth 10 less if it 's one year away if 2 years away etc   draw a timetable with each payment and divide by 1.1 for each year it 's away from present if the 9 coupon is really 4.5 twice a year it 's $ 450 in 6 month intervals and each 6 mo interval is really 5 you discount   short durations like this can be done by hand a 30 year bond with twice a year payments is a pain   welcome to money se

to understand the answer we first have to understand what goodwill is goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name good customer relations good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology an article from the economist explains this very well and actually talks about time warner directly the goodwill the bad and the ugly when one firm buys another the target ’s goodwill essentially the    premium paid over its book value is added to the combined entity ’s    balance sheet goodwill and other intangibles on the books of    companies in the s&p 500 are valued at $ 2.6 trillion or 10 of their    total assets according to analysts at goldman sachs as the economy and more firms trade down towards or even    below their book value empire builders are having to mark down the    value of assets they out on in times a recently    announced $ 25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push time warner    into an operating loss for 2008 for instance michael of    goldman sachs thinks such hits could amount to $ 200 billion or more    over the cycle investors have so far paid little attention to    intangibles but as write downs they are likely to become    increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to    assets such as health care consumer goods and telecoms how bad things get will depend on the american firms    used to be allowed to goodwill over many years since 2002    when an accounting rule change ended that practice goodwill has had    to be tested every year for impairment in this environment    with auditors than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on    clients companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any    doubt about their value the point out that this has no effect on cashflow since such    charges are non cash items moreover some investors take goodwill    write offs with a pinch of salt preferring to look past such    non recurring costs and accept the higher earnings    numbers to which managers understandably cling the largest companies    are thus able to survive blows that might otherwise floor    them such as the $ 99 billion loss that the newly formed but    ill conceived aol time warner as it then was reported for 2002 but    the impact can be all too real as write downs reduce overall book    value and increase leverage ratios a particular concern in these    debt averse times

gt   how is a loan an asset    to use your example our starting books are $ 100 in cash asset which corresponds to $ 100 in equity we then loan out $ 20 with a future return of $ 25 so our books have changed to $ 80 cash $ 25 in collectable loans assets $ 20 in loan liabilities and $ 80 in equity + $ 5 in interest revenue    gt i can not be acting like i have that 20 $ can i   not really and lending banks are regulated very tightly by having both required minimum capital adequacy ratios basically how many loans you can have out for a given amount of equity and annual stress testing by the fed   gt is n't that how the 08 crash happened is the risk of default accounted for    no and yes lending banks were n't really responsible for the crash and it certainly was n't because of over lending the problem was that the mortgage backed securities that banks were trading were at the time not properly valued to account for their risk and the resulting insurance contracts credit default obligations or cdos were improperly priced and leveraged the cdos were overly complicated and made some strong statistical assumptions about the underlying assets the mbss and the individual mortgages within them that lead to a systemic of risk in default probabilities esp banks since then have dramatically increased the size of their risk management departments and i think it 's fairly unlikely we see another systemic mispricing like that for some time   gt default risk is not transferred with the asset   i do n't agree with this in the basic cases if i sell you the rights to collect a loan that i wrote then absent of any other contract you will bear the full risk of the borrower defaulting   gt   how can it possibly be sold in such a way that the risk of default is detached   credit default swaps and other forms of insurance contracts i could sell you the loan as above but then you could buy an insurance contract on the loan that pays out if the borrower defaults in other words either the loan stays alive and you collect interest as normal or it defaults and you receive some payout from the insurance contract which limits your downside risk just about every large financial institution will have themselves hedged like this to some extent though perhaps by other means    regarding your overall question about student loan defaults i 'm in the camp that believes they 're an overstated direct risk it 's currently not possible to default on a student loan and if the law allowing student loan bankruptcy came in to effect i think we 'd see a large adjustment of interest rates on student loans and probably consumer loans etc as well to compensate for the increased risk of holding these loans   direct risk referring to the risk to the loan holder i think there is a risk that consumer spending becomes weighed down by the burden of large loans however i also do n't think this would appear as a sudden market shock and would likely manifest over an extended period of time   just my thoughts i 'm sure there are some people who 'll disagree with me on this

this may be more of a comment than an answer but it 's too long for a comment perhaps the stackexchange gods will forgive my that said even with the tax penalties it can be to your advantage to put money into a retirement account and withdraw it before retirement the trick is is the amount of the tax penalty more than the benefit of untaxed compound growth for example just to make up some numbers suppose you have $ 1000 of gross income to invest you are considering whether to invest in an ordinary non tax favored account or a classic ira either way you will get 10 returns your tax rate both when you put the money in and when you take it out is 15 there is a 10 tax penalty for early withdrawal with an ordinary account you will pay 15 tax off the top so you are only investing $ 850 then each year 15 of your returns are paid in taxes so your net return is 8.5 but when you withdraw the money there are no additional taxes with an ira you do not pay any taxes up front so you can invest the entire $ 1000 you collect 10 each year with no taxes when you withdraw you pay 15 plus the 10 penalty equals 25 so after 5 years the ordinary account would yield $ 850 x ^ 5 = $ the ira would yield $ 1000 x 1.1 ^ 5 x 0.75 = $ the tax penalty hurts you are better to use the ordinary account but if you could leave your money in for 25 years then the ordinary account would yield $ 850 x ^ 25 = $ the ira would yield $ 1000 x 1.1 ^ 25 x 0.75 = $ the ira even with the tax penalty is better of course my numbers are just made up what your tax bracket is what returns you get and how long you think you might leave the money in the investment all vary

i 'm going to assume that you want to be invested all the time and each trade consists in selling a security and buying another one similar to your example how much commissions you are willing to pay depends on several factors but one way to think about it is as follows you have a position in stock a and you want to switch to stock b because you think it will perform better if you think there 's a good chance > 50 that b will outperform a by more than x% then you can happily pay up to commissions and still make money over a long time horizon if you like formulae one way to express it is where example if you tend to be right 51 of the time hit rate and gain 110 more than you lose on average win loss ratio you can see that your expected profit is 5.1 commissions so you could pay 2.5 commissions on entering and closing the position and still make money*. unfortunately common sense statistics and numerous studies tell us a sad truth on average people have a hit rate of 50 and a win loss ratio of 100 which means that their expected profit per trade is 0 commission based on that crude observation unless you can prove to yourself that you are better than average you should aim at reducing commissions paid to your broker as much as possible through 51 and 110 are not random numbers they correspond to the results of the top 15 professional managers in a research paper using a sample of funds managing $

the most fundamental answer is that when you short a stock or an etf you short a specific number of shares on a specific day and you probably do n't adjust this much as the price goes up and down but an inverse fund is not tied to a specific start date like your own transaction is   it adjusts on an ongoing basis to maintain its full specified leverage at all times   if the underlying index goes up it has to effectively buy in because its collateral is no longer sufficient to support its open position   on the other hand if the underlying index goes down that frees up collateral which is used to effectively short sell more of the underlying   so by design it will buy high and sell low and so any volatility will pump money out of the fund i say effectively because inverse funds use derivatives and contracts rather than actually shorting the underlying security    which brings up the less fundamental issue   these derivatives and contracts are relatively opaque the counter parties are in it for their own benefit not yours and the people who run the fund get their expenses regardless of how you do and they are hard for you to monitor   this is a hazardous combination

assuming the numbers in your comments are accurate you have $ extra after paying your expenses   i assume this includes loan payments you said you have $ 3k in savings and a $ monthly nut so only one month of living expenses in savings in my opinion your first goal should be to put 100 of your extra money towards savings each month until you have six months of living expenses saved   that 's $ 6 or $   since you have $ 3 k already that means you need $ more which is exactly six months $ next i would pay off your $ 4 k for the bedroom furniture   i do n't know the terms you got but usually if you are not completely paid off when it comes time to pay interest the rate is very high and you have to pay interest not just going forward but from the inception of the loan ymmv check your loan terms you may want to look into consolidating your high interest loans into a single loan at a lower rate   barring that i would put 100 of my extra monthly income toward your 10 loan until its paid off and then your loan until that 's paid off   i would not consider investing in any non tax advantaged vehicle until those two loans at minimum were paid off   is a very good guaranteed return on your money after that i would continue the strategy of aggressively paying the maximum per month toward your highest interest loans until they are all paid off with the possible exception of the very low rate sallie mae loans   however i 'm probably more conservative than your average investor and i have a major aversion to paying interest

i remember reading in an earlier version of pub 590 or possibly the instructions for form 8606 that timely contributions for year x to an ira are deemed to have been made on january 1 of year x regardless of when they were actually made but i do n't seem to be able to find it now in current versions of pubs or 590b and so can not include a citation of chapter and verse be that as it may the calculations on on form 8606 part i effectively track basis on an annual basis rather than on a daily basis and so the fact that the traditional ira has a zero balance and basis 0 too at some time during the year does n't matter in the least   in detail though you did n't ask for it note that the whole $ 6500 that you put in remains non deductible in its entirety but you owe taxes on only $ of that $ 100 k that you rolled over into a roth ira and not on the whole $ 100 k as you were assuming would have been the case so in effect of that $ 6500 nondeductible contribution to your traditional ira you did really get to deduct $ from your taxable income for 2016 and make only a $ 400 nondeductible contribution exactly equal to your basis in your traditional ira as per the form 8606 calculations   i can only assume that the software package that you are using the above calculations exactly and does what the irs says you must do on form 8606 rather than what you get by tracking the basis on a daily basis irs regulations and instructions are not necessarily the same as what the tax law says they are interpretations of the tax law based on what the irs understands the tax law to say people have challenged various specific irs regulations and interpretations as being different from what the law says in tax court and been successful in some cases and failed in others if you believe that tracking basis on a daily basis is what the law says instead of just being reasonable and rational and rationality are not required either of congress in the laws that they write or the irs regulations that interpret the laws you should take up the matter with the irs or the tax court

i agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan it may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money   i know of one called lending club disclaimer i 'm an investor on this platform not trying to advertise it 's just the only place i know of off the top of my head that facilitates loans like this but instead of a bank financing the loan the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount such as $ 25 they have rates anywhere between 5 30 based on your credit and i believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that you 're discussing   regarding buying the house the best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20 downpayment if at all possible below this amount you may be asked to pay for pmi private mortgage insurance this is a charge that does n't go away for quite a while until you 've paid them 20 of the appraised value of the home where you pay a premium because you did n't have the 20 downpayment for the house   i would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible and would recommend the same for your father getting your utilization down and the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable fixed payment   whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you if it were me personally i 'd do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time but if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your tax free savings account it may not be a beneficial situation   treat debt especially credit card debt like an emergency at all times and you 'll find yourself in a better place as a result   credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary and their rates and fees are structured that way if for any reason you expect that a credit card 's balance will remain for an extended period of time you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan instead

you are co signer on his car loan you have no ownership unless the car is titled in both names   one option not the best see below is to buy the car from him   arrange your own financing take over his loan or get a loan of your own to pay him for the car   the bank(s will help you take care of getting the title into your name   and the bank holding the note will hold the title as well best advice is to get with him sell the car take any money left after paying off the loan and use it to buy cash purchase not finance a reliable efficient used car if you truly need a car at all if you can get to work by walking or public transit you can save thousands per year and perhaps use that money to start you down the road to financial independence   take a couple of hours and research this   in the us we tend to view cars as necessary but this is not always true   actually it 's true less than half the time even if you can not or choose not to live within bicycle distance of work you can still reduce your commuting cost by not financing and by driving a fuel efficient vehicle   ask yourself would you give up your expensive vehicle if it meant retiring years earlier   maybe as many as ten years earlier

rich people use depositor banks the same way the rest of us use banks to keep a relatively small store of wealth for monthly expenses and a savings account for a rainy day the bulk of a wealthy person 's money is in investments money sitting in a bank account is not making you more money and in fact as correctly points out would be losing value to inflation now all investments have risk that 's why interest exists if in some alternate universe charging interest were illegal across the board nobody would loan money because there 's nothing to be gained and a lot to lose you have to make it worth my while for me to want to loan you my money because sure as you 're going to use my loan to make yourself wealthier a wealthy person will choose a set of investments that represent an overall level of risk that he is comfortable with much like you or i would do the same with our retirement funds early in life we 're willing to take a lot of risk because there 's a lot of money to be made and time to recover from any losses closer to retirement we 're much more risk averse because if the market takes a sudden downturn we lose a significant portion of our nest egg with little hope of it before we have to start cashing out the very wealthy have similar variances in risk with the significant difference that they are typically already drawing a living from their investments as such they already have some risk aversion but at the same time they need good returns and so they must pay more attention to this balancing act between risk and return managing their investments in effect becomes their new job once they do n't have to work for anyone else anymore the money does the real work and they make the executive decisions about where best to put it the tools they use to make these decisions are the same ones we have they watch market trends to identify stages of the economic cycle that large movements of money to or from safe havens like gold and t debt they diversify their investments to shield the bulk of their wealth from a sudden localized loss they hire investment managers to have a second pair of eyes and additional expertise in navigating the market you or i can do much the same thing by buying shares in managed investment funds or simply consulting a broker the difference is that the wealthy get a more personal touch so what 's the difference between the very wealthy and the rest of us well first is simple scale when a person with a net worth in the hundreds of millions makes a phone call or personal visit to the financial institutions handling their money there 's a lot of money on the line in making sure that person is well looked after if we get screwed over at the teller window and decide to close our the teller can often give us our entire account balance in cash without an our multimillionaire is at the lower end of being able to alter his banks profit loss statements by his decisions and so his bank will fight to keep his business second is the level of control the very wealthy the upper 1 have more or less direct ownership and control over many of the major means of production in this country the factories mines timber farms software houses power plants recording studios etc that generate things of value and therefore new wealth while the average joe can buy shares in these things through the open market their investment is typically a drop in the bucket and their voice in company decisions equally small our decision therefore is largely to invest or not to invest the upper 1 on the other hand have controlling interests in their investments often majority holdings that allow them far more control over the businesses they invest in who 's running them and what they do

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

there are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind if you are a cash basis taxpayer most individuals are then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet   if you operate on an accrual basis then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client you can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates and if these together with any income tax withholding from wage paying jobs are at least 90 of your tax liability for that year then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year if your income does vary considerably over the year even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds the income can   vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in december then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax this is called the method a part of form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it   your annualized income for the payment due on june 15 is 2.4 = times your taxable income through may 31 thus on form 2210 you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income   through may 31 will continue for the rest of the year you then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45 of that amount by june 15 similarly for september 15 for which you look at income through august 31 you use a multiplier of 1.5 = and need to pay of the tax on the annualized income and so on   if you these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment then you owe penalties for that quarter   most people find that the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method even simpler is to pay 100 of last year 's tax in four equal installments 110 for high earners and then no penalty is due at all if your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year then this of last year 's tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till april 15

in the short term a savings account with an online bank can net you ~1 interest while many banks credit unions with local branches are 0.05 most of the online savings accounts allow 6 withdrawals per month they 'll let you do more but charge a fee if you pair it with a checking account you can transfer your expected monthly need in one or two planned transfers to your checking account any other options that may result in a higher yield will either tie up your money for a set length of time or expose you to risk of losing money i would n't recommend gambling on short term stock gains if you need the money during the off season

if you did n't receive the money in 2012 or have constructive receipt you really ca n't claim the income if the company is going to give you a 1099 for the work they are n't going to give you one until next year and if you claim it this year you will have a hard time explaining the income difference on the other hand if this is n't miscellaneous income but rather self employment income and expenses you should be able to claim the expenses in 2012 and if you have a loss that would carry over to 2013 note it is possible to use an accrual basis if you are running a business which would allow you to do this but it is more complex than the cash accounting individual tax payers use

each way you go is a little bit of a gamble    owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth    the royalty is best in situations where you 're getting a portion of the gross since you get paid as a creditor no matter how the company is performing or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth then they 're pretty much both for the same thing you 've removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment if the company ever does buy out or go public how much of your additional x earning a month would you have to then re invest to get an equity stake   and for royalties if another developer came aboard or your company bought another company how much would this dilute your ip contribution so aside from the gambling nature of the issue i 'm not sure your tax calculation is right   you can take equity profit as dividend as long as you 're collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend   this would put those profits into a different tax bracket 15 capital gains or if all profits are split you could take part as salary part as dividend   as well as someone who 's making active income off of their ip not passive income you 're supposed to file a schedule c not a schedule e so your royalties would include your self employment taxes   the schedule e is for royalties where the author is n't actively in the field or actually self employed in that area or if you own royalties on something you did n't create   should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a schedule e.   now a tax advantage may exist on a schedule c if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you ca n't on a schedule e though it 'd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a schedule e.

there is a survivorship bias in the mutual fund industry it 's not about individual stocks in which those funds invest rather it 's in which funds and fund companies families are still around the underperforming funds get closed or merged into other funds thus they are no longer reported since they no longer exist this makes a single company 's mutual funds appear to have a better history on average than they actually did similarly fund companies that underperform will go out of business this could make the mutual fund industry 's overall history appear to be better than it actually was most companies do n't do this to deliberately game the numbers it 's rational on the part of fund companies to close underperforming funds when a fund has a below average history investors will likely not invest in it and will remove their existing money the fund will shrink while the overhead remains the same making the fund unprofitable for the company to run

yes merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card for a credit card transaction interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer this is why australians are seeing a boom in debit mastercard visa cards the issuing banks make income when you select credit   these costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a credit card fee for an transaction the interchange flows the other way from the card issuer to the acquiring bank the merchant 's bank   as an aside the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in australia restrict you from selecting credit with a scheme debit card mastercard and visa are schemes   they are in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit savings and pay if you hit credit therefore where you can hit either credit or savings they prefer and may force you to press savings

form is to report to the irs withholding of capital gains tax that may be due from the seller foreign nationals do n't always file tax returns so they often did n't pay capital gains tax on properties that they sold congress decided to make the buyers responsible for this tax so that they would have a better chance of collecting it there is a penalty against the buyer if that tax is not withheld your attorney should have filed this form on your behalf as part of the closing papers i think your first step is to look at your copy of the closing papers and see if money was withheld from the sale there definitely should be disclosure of these requirements before the sale you should also follow up with your attorney to see whether he has already filed the forms and on your behalf if you had purchased for less than $ 300,000 and were purchasing for your primary residence you would not have to file that form but since the property was under $ 1,000,000 the withholding rate is only 10 rather than 15

i assume i can will need to file an 83(b election in order to avoid    tax repercussions what exactly will this save me from 83(b election is for restricted stock grants not for stock purchases for restricted stocks you generally pay income tax when they vest for startups the price difference between the time of the grant and the time of the vesting can be astronomical and by choosing 83(b you effectively pay income tax on the value of the grant instead of the value of the vest then you only pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the grant value when you sell in your case you 're exercising an option i.e. you 're buying a stock so 83(b is irrelevant what you will pay though is the tax on the difference between the strike price and the stock fmv unless the stocks you end up buying are restricted which would have been the case if you exercised your options early but i do n't think is going to be the case now what steps should i take to in the eyes of the law guarantee that    the board has received my execution notice the secretary of the board    is a notorious and can be very unorganized you should read what the grant contract company policy says on that ask the hr manager usually a certified letter with return receipt should be enough but you should verify the format the address and the timeframe

while i agree with ben a lot i feel like his answer is really poor here you do not call a number to give your credit card information out for a refund   that is ridiculous   just from his answer he has had 5 cases of fraud lately you should know that you should n't follow this advice i personally do n't ever give my credit card number over the phone unless it is the very very very last resort   it is not just about money and safety but it is about time   every time that you give your number out over the phone there is a chance that the employee on the other end by either scam or legitimate business will use or sell your info   so you need to determine if the time saved by doing a transaction over the phone is worth hours days of your time if your card has a fraud issue   and note that fraud sometimes is easily negated but if done smartly can be hard to prove via a quick call or email to card company what should you do tell company that you will simply get the refund through your credit card company and if we go back to time element   you fill out form on card website   card company goes back to vendor and says why are you asking for card numbers via email   card company either cancels vendor contract or more likely helps them understand the technology available so they do n't have to do this   therefore that quick form that you filled out will now keep this company from bugging you again   by going through their archaic systems you are enabling their behavior

the fact that you 're a minor really only factors into who pays the taxes you or your parents if you are below the age where you can legally earn money and therefore pay taxes then the income will be considered your parent 's or guardian 's income and they will be responsible for the taxes if you are of the age where you are legally allowed to earn your own money then yes you will have to pay taxes either way taxes must be paid if age were a way of escaping the taxes every big would simply open their account in the name of one of their children or a child they know

it 's not your money     according to one article the interest on the money could be negotiated in some cases to be yours but i would n't plan on it from msn according to a complaint filed by the    state of minnesota the old    social worker received a $ 2.6 million    payment from the state department of    human services that had been intended    for a local hospital instead of    immediately reporting the mistake the    woman and a friend opened investment    accounts bought jewelry purchased    four vehicles including two land    and spent $ at best buy    six weeks after getting the money she    called the human services department    to ask why the check had been sent to    her according to the complaint when    informed the payment was an error and    the money had to be returned the    woman reportedly told the department    to talk to her attorney and refused to    respond to follow up calls   as the    prosecutor said to a st. paul pioneer    press reporter there 's a big    difference between keeping money when    you ca n't reasonably be expected to    determine the true owner like that    $ 20 bill on the street and keeping    money when you can the state had the    pair 's accounts frozen and is    prosecuting for theft as well as civil    charges though the woman returned the    money and the property she    bought more from msn money a    better approach to an    windfall is to keep the money in a    separate account while you track down    the source who gets to keep the    interest earned will be one of those    things you work out with the rightful    owner 's attorneys bankrate has a similar story posted as well

an option without the vesting period and the price at which one can exercise the option is of not much value if vesting is determined by board then at any given point in time they can change the vesting period to say 3 5 10 years any number the other aspect is at what price you are allowed to exercise the option ie if the stock is of value 10 you may be given an option to buy this at 10 20 or 100 this has to be stated upfront for you to know the real value on listing if the value is say 80 then if you have the option to exercise at 10 or 20 you would make money else at 100 you loose money and hence choose not to exercise the option however your having stuck around the company for x years in anticipation of making money would go waste without a vesting period or the price to exercise the option they are pretty much meaningless and would depend on the goodwill of the founders

the plumber will apply for and receive a refund of the amount of vat he paid on the purchase amount   that 's the cornerstone of how vat works as opposed to a sales tax   so for example rounded approximate amounts for simplicity now at each point the amount between original cost vat and new vat is refunded   so by the end a total of £ 3 vat is paid on the pipe not £ 6.2 and at each point the business adding value at that stage pays that much   the material company adds £ 1 value the producer adds £ 4 value the supplier adds £ 5 value the plumber adds £ 5 value    each pays some amount of vat on that amount typically 20 unless it 's zero reduced rated   so the pipe supplier pays £ 1 but gets a £ 0.2 refund so truly pays £ 0.8   the plumber pays £ 3 from your payment but gets a £ 2 refund    so at each level somebody paid a bit and then that bit is then refunded to the next person up the ladder with the final person in the chain paying the full amount   the £ 0.2 is refunded to the producer the £ 1 is refunded to the supplier the £ 2 is refunded to the plumber

most banks offer prepaid cards nowadays that should fit the bill here i would recommend first checking with your bank to see what they offer as that 's probably the easiest and perhaps cheapest option my bank for example has an entirely fee free prepaid card that while marketed towards teens is entirely applicable for this case   other banks seem to offer similar products some of them have more or less fees but almost all that i 've seen are better than the commercial products you 'd find in a grocery store    as an example and i do n't know anything about it so i do n't specifically recommend this just what i mean note that the fees vary some should be able to be used without ever incurring fees and some have fees you wo n't avoid   most seem to have the concept of sponsor or it you are the cardholder your dad would be the companion cardholder but in either way it means you can load money and generally would be the sole money and your dad could then spend it if your bank does n't offer what you want you may want to consider getting an account with a provider that offers what you 're looking for so to make deposits easier   most of these allow deposits from other sources than checking accounts with that bank but in many cases you may incur a fee or take longer for the money to clear

if this is because he wants to avoid paying taxes will i get in trouble if i agree to have him work on my vehicle you should check your state and local sales tax laws to be certain but in my state you have no liability if he does not pay his taxes   that 's his problem not yours   the biggest risk for you is if something goes wrong you have no proof that the work was ever done so it 's possible he could deny that any transaction ever took place and refuse to correct it or refund your money   so at worst you 're out what you paid for the service plus what it would cost you to fix it if you needed to and chose to do so   if you do n't want to take that risk then insist on a receipt or take you   business elsewhere but there 's no criminal liability for you if he chooses not to report the income edit be aware though that state tax is levied at the state and local level so the laws of your individual state or city may be different

i was amazed to find out that many people think that credit ratings are equivalent across asset classes    rating agencies do not and can not rate assets based on market exposure there ratings represent the assets idiosyncratic risk obviously assets that are more exposed to the market have higher risk in a market downturn but higher reward in a boom     this is pretty well known and documented the agencies that are paid by debt issuers are there to establish that the asset meets certain established criteria often this involves the interest rate thus as most people that are familiar with financial markets know the major cra 's tend to be reactionary and a much better gauge of actual credit worthiness is the market interest rate however these ratings do have a purpose for creating standardized practices for governments and other public organizations subscriber based will almost always give much more accurate and detailed information just as with everything else if you want something done right your gon na have to do it yourself    that said it will be interesting to see how the agencies adapt to dodd frank which mandates that their ratings translate across asset classes especially since gov debt is in a whole different tax category and thus intrinsically has lower interest rates and thus lower default rates in the end the rating agencies are just going to have to say well since the interest rate is under inflation we know that it is aaa lol thus they are useless in addition the rating of government debt has less to do with ability to pay back obligations and more to do with at least in a democracy political will how is this supposed to be quantified

having worked at a financial institution this is a somewhat simple two part solution 1 the vendor financial institution simply turns off the overdraft protection in all its forms if no funds are available at a pin presented transaction the payment is simply declined no fee no overdraft no mess 2 this sticking point for a recurring transaction is that merchants such as netflix gold 's gym etc choose to allow payments like this because they are assured they are going to get paid by the financial institution it prevents them from having issues only a gift card will not cost you more money than you put in but i know of several institutions that too many non payment periods can cause them to cease doing business with you in the future tl dr imo if you do n't want to pay more than you have gift cards are the way to go you can re charge them whenever you choose and should you run into a problem simply buy a new card and start over

there is nothing fair unfair in such deals it is an art than a science   what kind of things should be considered to work out what would be a fair percentage stake a true fair value is take the current valuation of the company this can be difficult if it is small and does not maintain proper records divide by number of shares that is the value of share and you should 20 k worth of such shares but then there is risk premium you are taking a risk that an small start up may do exceedingly well or it may close off this risk premium is what is negotiated it depends on how desperate the owner of the small company is who all are interested in this specific deal if you want 30 share someone else is ready to offer 20 k for 15 of share or there is no one willing to lend 20 k as they do n't believe it will make money and the owner is desperate you may even get 50

most of the work done as an analyst or associate depends on whether or not you are assigned to a deal at the time   if not you 're probably going to be working on pitch books which is basically putting together a firm template style powerpoint file pitching a company to a potential client   the pace is slower but the work is boring   if you 're on a deal then the stress level is raised as you have to respond to client demands and timing immediately   you are typically doing some basic forms of analysis modeling and then importing that into a powerpoint report   you are working on these reports endlessly turning review comments from associates vp 's and md 's   as you get higher up the chain you do more of the communicating to all the various parties to the deal third party diligence buy side etc and client facing activities   you can find a lot of good info on the finance industry on   i 'm personally in transaction services doing diligence work at a big4 and i 've always found wso to be a good resource for at least basic info   you obviously need to weed out the people who are don't know anything current students but plenty of guys actually in the industry post regularly

currency exchange is rather the norm than the exception in international wire transfers so the fact that the amount needs to be exchanged should have no impact at all the processing time depends on the number of participating banks and their speeds typically between europe and the us one or two business days are the norm sending from other countries might involve more steps banks   which each takes a bit of time however anything beyond 5 business days is not normal consider if there are external delays how did you initiate the sending was it in person with an agent of the bank who might have put it on a stack and they type it in only a day later or worse or was it online so it is in the system right away on the receiver side how did you your friend check could there be a delay by waiting for an account statement finally and that is the most common reason were all the numbers names and codes absolutely correct even a small mismatch in name spelling might trigger the receiving bank to not allocate the money into the account either way if you contact the sender bank you will be able to make them follow up on it they must be able to trace where they money went and where it currently is if it is stuck they will be able to get it

as for income tax purposes 's answer is correct the entire amount that is converted is post tax you had to pay tax on any pre tax amounts upon conversion so you do not pay tax on it when you withdraw it in a non qualified distribution similar to with contributions however there 's another perhaps more important consideration here the early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions from roth ira for non qualified distributions of contributions there is never an early withdrawal penalty for non qualified distributions of rollovers and conversions there is an early withdrawal penalty if withdrawn within 5 years of the rollover or conversion but only on the part of the rollover or conversion that was taxable during the conversion so if you want to withdraw within 5 years of the conversion then it works differently from direct contributions because contributions and conversions have different treatment for the penalty the ordering between them matters too contributions are always withdrawn before rollovers and conversions a later contribution still comes before an earlier rollover or conversion but within rollovers and conversions they are ordered by year an earlier rollover or conversion comes before a later one and within a year the taxable part is ordered before the non taxable part

it is a decent time to purchase real estate despite 's opinion   i feel is falling for the old economic psychology of what ever direction its going it will continuing in that direction which is a bad mentality for any investing up or down      this may not be the bottom and there is some sign that another dip is coming with in a year or two   but if you purchase now and focus on a few key factors you may end up on the upside of the swing   first and foremost location matters more then value of the property   when the up demand is eventually released after we get employment moving in the right direction you will see a land grab   the first and highest valued places are those with nice neighborhoods and good schools as the young families economically start making homes     second pay attention to valuation in so much as your burden   this means consider taxes and mortgage and terms of mortgage stay away from variable or balloon rates   when thing go up the interest rates will lead the way   in this time of uncertainty you should make sure you can cover your mortgage payment with ease   put plenty down 20 being the recommended to avoid mortgage insurance and long term costs and shoot low on   price   if you 're handy you may even consider buying something that needs minor work outdated kitchen or the like    if you shoot lower then your limit then you 'll be comfortable even if things turn sour for you   ultimately all this hinges on what you want to do with the property   its a wise time to buy homes today where you will be able to rent them out tomorrow   but the important thing is aim in the middle instead of at your limit 450 is definitely your limit   remember banks will always tell you that you 're able to afford twice as much as you actually should   and keep in mind no matter how new or nice the home it will need work at some point and that costs   so you should have that in mind when you consider savings   based on your information i would nt shoot higher then 250 300k   i have friends who make your salary in dividends plus two incomes and they are comfortable in their home at its 250 price   they are able to afford repairs and upgrade regularly and are nt threatened by potential tax hikes though they gripe of course    the one good piece of advice from imho is that you should be ready for the environment to change   higher interests rates will weigh on your comfort as much as cpi and increased taxes will so plan for them to be much higher and you 'll be ahead of the game

the core idea behind this statement is that there is always money for what you prioritize if you try to use whatever is left over after your bills for savings you probably wo n't save very much if anything in practice you decide on a fixed amount of money you will save out of each paycheck and put that aside in an investment or savings account then pay your bills out of what is left   essentially it is a way to counteract the tendency of your lifestyle rising to exactly meet your income and leaving nothing for savings

retail brokers and are generally not members of exchanges and would generally not be members of exchanges unless they are directly routing orders to those exchanges most retail brokers charging $ 7 are considered discount brokers and such brokers route order to market makers who are members of the exchanges all brokers and market makers must be members of finra and must pay finra registration and licensing fees   discount brokers also have operational costs which include the cost of their facilities technology clearing fees regulation and human capital market makers will have the same costs but the cost of technology is probably much higher discount brokers will also have market data fees which they will have to pay to the exchanges for the right to show customer real time quotes   some of their fees can be offset through payment for order flow where market makers pay routing brokers a small fee for sending orders to them for execution the practice of has actually allowed retail brokers to keep their costs lower but to to shrinking margins and spread market makers has significantly declined over the years   markets makers generally do not pass along exchange access fees which are capped at $ not to routing brokers   also note that the sec and finra charges transactions fees sec fee for sales are generally passed along to customers and noted on trade confirms finra is born by the market makers and often subtracted from paid to routing firms other full service brokers charging higher commissions are charging for the added value of their brokers providing advice and expertise in helping investors with investment strategies they will generally also have the same fees associated with membership of all the exchanges as they are also market makers subject to some of the list of cost mentioned above   one point of note is that market making technology is quite and very expensive   it has driven most of wholesale market makers of the 90s into consolidation     retail routing firm 's save a significant amount of money for not having to operate such a system as well as worry about the regulatory headaches associated with running such a system   this allows them to provide much lower commissions that the full service or bulge bracket brokers

unless you are buying millions of dollars worth of a stock at a time your transaction is a drop in the bucket unlikely to have any effect on the stock price as ian says it 's more likely that you are just remembering the times when the price dropped after you bought if you keep careful track i suspect you will find that the price goes up more often than it goes down or at least that the stocks you buy go up as often as the average stock on the market goes up if you actually kept records and found that 's not true the most likely explanation is bad luck or that someone has placed a voodoo curse on you i suppose one could imagine other scenarios like if you regularly buy stock based on recommendations by well known market pundits you could expect to see a temporary increase in price as thousands or millions of people who hear this recommendation rush to buy and then a few days or weeks later people move on to the next recommendation the market down and the price reverts to a more normal level in that case if you 're on the tail end of the buying rush you could end up paying a premium i 'm just speculating here i have n't done a study to find if this actually happens but it sounds plausible to me

this is only true for countries where we do n't have a tax treaty if we have a tax treaty with the country then you would get foreign tax credits if you repatriated the money the reason us corporates do this is because us corporate tax rate is the second highest effective rate in the world at ~40 depending on the state you 're in    so if they want to repatriated cash from canada they 'd repatriate at the us rate and then receive foreign tax credits for the amount they paid in canadian taxes on balance they 'll have just paid the us rate

in terms of preserving good relationships one approach is to charge a nominal rate of interest maybe a few percent of the total and agree a time when it should be paid back this may actually make them feel better about borrowing them money especially especially if it is something like business loan or buying a house or car   if they need the money for a real crisis and they have no clear strategy for paying it back then it may just be better all around if you make it clear that it is a gift   what you do n't want to do is set up a situation where you are creating unnecessary problems down the road and that will very much depend on your individual relationship and how seriously you take the loan   here it is important that you are completely open and honest about the arrangement so take the time to make sure that both parties understand exactly what they expect from each other

usually points have different value depending on what you use it for and how much of them you convert for many providers if you have enough 10000 + usually points it is possible to convert them 1:1 which means 1 point converted to 1 cent to either cash or something that is almost as good as cash $ 100 gift card for some popular store or $ 100 amazon.com certificate etc some cards have more exotic ways of getting best value such as transferring money to pay student loans retirement accounts etc so to get the best value i 'd recommend to make a list of what you can get from your program most types of reward are uniform i.e. many gift cards with the same price so the work may be less than it seems and calculate point values of each of those if you want to be really precise take into account that if you buy something with points you do not earn points on that which reduces the value a little in general these days it is very rare to get a card that produces more than 1 back though some have up to 5 for certain categories of purchases

sensitive topic inflation is a consequence of the mismatch between supply and demand   in an ideal world the amount of goods available would exactly match the demand for those goods    we do n't live in an ideal world one example of oversupply is dollar stores where you can buy from companies that demand   most recently we 've seen wheat prices rise as fires outside moscow damaged the harvest and the russian government banned exports and that introduces the danger of inflation inflation is a signal like the pain you feel after an injury   if you simply took a you may completely ignore a broken leg until took your life governments sometimes ban inflation by fixing prices   both the and venezuelan governments have tried this recently   the consequence of that is goods become unavailable as producers refuse to create supply for less than the cost of production as pointed out governments do desperately want to avoid deflation as much as they want to avoid hyperinflation there is a correct level and that has resulted in the monetary policy called inflation where central banks attempt to manage inflation into a target range usually around 2 to 6 the reason is simply that limited inflation drives investment and consumption   with a guaranteed return on investment people with cash will lend it to people with ideas   consumers will buy goods today if they fear that the price will rise tomorrow if prices fall as they have done during the two decades of deflation in japan then the result is lower levels of investment and employment as companies cut production capacity   if prices rise to quickly as in zimbabwe and venezuela then people can not save enough or earn enough and so their wealth is drained away add to this the continual process of innovation and you see how difficult it is to manage inflation at all   innovation can result in increased efficiency which can reduce prices   it can also result in a new product which is sufficiently unique to allow predatory pricing the apple iphone new types of medicines and so on the best mechanism we have for figuring out where money should be invested and who is the best recipient of any good is the price mechanism   inflation is the signal that investors need to learn how best to manage their efforts we hide from it at our peril

if you just buy a few lotto tickets normally then no it 's not going to be a good investment as has shown however there are certain scenarios where you can get a positive expected value from a lottery in 2012 it was revealed that some mit students found a scheme to game the massachusetts state lottery   the game called cash had a in the rules the jackpot prize was capped at $ 2 million   any money in the jackpot beyond $ 2 million would increase the payout of the consolation prizes   thus the game would sometimes have a positive expected value   the return on investment was 15 to 20 enough for the participants to quit their jobs this specific loophole is no longer available a cap was placed on the number of tickets sold per store then the game was discontinued altogether another possible strategy is to buy enough tickets to nearly assure a win as one investment group did in 1992   given a large enough jackpot this strategy can yield a positive expected value but not a guaranteed profit caveats include or you might be a genius and exploit a flaw in the lottery 's number generator as one statistician did in an ontario scratch off lottery in 2011

the just accounting is how money market works these days lets look at this simplified example the bank creates an asset loan in the amount of x secured by a house worth assuming 20 downpayment the bank also creates a liability in the amount of x to its depositors because the money lent was the money first deposited into the bank by someone else or borrowed by the bank from the federal reserve which is again a liability that liability is not secured now the person defaults on the loan in the amount of x but at that time the prices dropped and the house is now worth the bank forecloses sells the house recovers 80 of the loan and removes the asset of the loan creating an asset of cash in the value of but the liability in the amount of x did n't go anywhere bank still has to repay the x amount of money back to its depositors feds the difference 20 of x in our scenario that 's the bank 's loss federal reserve is the us equivalent of a central bank

only would it be illegal the $ 10k does n't even sound like it would be a bonus of any sort for doing so from the article   gt if a restaurant opts in it 'll get a $ 10,000 gift from visa v to help pay for technology upgrades the company said   emphasis is mine     edit i was curious about this so i started doing a little reading up on businesses not accepting cash it turns out that it is legal to refuse cash but only if there is no debt to pay if you get your product first then there 's a debt to pay and the business must accept cash if the customer pays first then there 's no debt to pay the customer is already paid up so the business does not have to accept cash   link for the info   there are plenty of additional articles that talk about it but i opted to link this one as it 's a recent article by an economic researcher at a university i figured that if i 'm going to link something a primary source is probably better than a news agency reporting on it   it 's kind of interesting really and i wonder how it would work in a place such as a restaurant you typically get your food first and pay later this creates a scenario where the customer is in debt to the restaurant so the restaurant would theoretically have to accept cash however if you pay first then get your food you do n't have an outstanding debt and thus the restaurant does n't have to accept cash   looking at the article again about visa 's offer two of the types of groups it mentions are cafes and food trucks which typically require you to pay before you get your food this would mean that the customer is n't in debt to the service and thus cash can be refused   how that would work out at a restaurant is another question entirely as the vast majority of the american restaurant expect to pay after they eat this may be why the article specifically mentions small business restaurants a local restaurant is going to have a much easier time going cashless than a national chain would and the $ 10k would do more for them to update their systems than it would for the national chain additionally people might be more willing to accept the different practices at a restaurant than they would at a nation wide chain   definitely an interesting bit of reading and a fun bit of learning

you can move money in and out of the business at will just keep track of every transaction ideally you 'd use an accounting software like quickbooks or similar create a capital contributions account and every time you put money into the business checking account record it as a capital contribution likewise if you take money out of the business it comes from your capital accounts you can create a separate capital distributions account in your accounting software or just use a single account for contributions and distributions money coming in and out of those capital accounts is not taxable because you will pay taxes based on net earnings regardless of whether or not you have distributed any profits so there 's no need to make a loan to the company which would have tax consequences to reimburse yourself for purchases already made submit an expense report to the company if the company is unfunded right now you can make a capital contribution to cover current expenses submit the expense report and wait until you have some profits before paying out the expense report or making any distributions welcome to entrepreneurship

no as a director normally you ca n't as a director of a limited company all those payments should be accounted for as directors remuneration and have been subject to paye and even if you are self employed currently there is no legislation which prevents a director from receiving self employment income from a company in which he is a director however the default position of hmrc 's is that all the payments derived from the are subject to paye in other words it 's possible only invoice from an business or in a consultancy role that 's not directly related to the trade of business but it really depends on the circumstances and the contracts in place sources at forum david at and at   more sources if a person does other work that ’s not related to being a director they may have an employment contract and get employment rights source employment status as director at gov.uk in principle it is possible for an employee or office holder to tender for work with their employer outside their normal duties in circumstances where that individual will not be providing service as an employee or office holder but as a self employed contractor where there is any doubt about whether service is provided constitutes employment or self employment see the employment status manual source section 62 2003 at hmrc

when you buy a house the real estate agent or title company normally draws up a big sheet with all the costs and payments involved there are typically two columns one for amounts paid to or paid by the seller and another for amounts paid to or paid by the buyer who is responsible for what is a legal question this is pretty fixed but it 's very common for the seller to agree to pay some portion of the buyer 's closing costs in any house sale i 've ever been involved in whether as buyer or seller nobody bothers to say which costs the seller is agreeing to pay rather the seller just agrees to a number then somewhere on the sheet of costs there will be a line that says closing costs paid by seller or some such wording and then it shows a minus to the seller and a plus to the buyer or something equivalent depending on how the sheet is organized   the amount is negotiated when you make an offer you 'll say whatever numbers you are prepared to offer like i offer to pay $ 100,000 for the house seller to pay $ 3,000 of closing costs and whatever other conditions seller to repair the leak in the roof whatever it makes sense for the seller to pick up some share of the closing costs because the seller normally walks away with cash in hand while the buyer is struggling to come up with enough cash to make a down payment and pay all the closing costs i.e. the seller probably can afford to give up some cash while the buyer may be struggling to come up with cash the only costs i can think of that i 've had before closing day are a earnest money b inspection c credit check or application fee to bank earnest money is applied to the purchase price at closing so it 's pretty much a moot point the application fee is a potential deal breaker i 've never heard of a seller agreeing to pay this but i guess they could but if you ca n't get the loan you probably wo n't buy the house so the seller would be out money for nothing   everything else is normally paid on closing day they total up all the costs and all the money floating around and at the end the seller gets one check that is the net of everything and the buyer writes one check that is the net of everything and the realtor or title company deals with getting the money to the right people so there 's normally no issue of paying things as they come up you do it all at once

hey guys i have a quick question about a financial accounting problem although i think it 's not really an accounting problem but just a bond problem   here it goes     corporation issued semiannual coupon bonds with a face value of $ 110,000 several years ago the annual coupon rate is 8 with two coupons due each year six months apart the historical market interest rate was 10 compounded when corporation issued the bonds equal to an effective interest rate of = 1.05 × 1.05 1 corporation accounts for these bonds using amortized cost measurement based on the historical market interest rate the current market interest rate at the beginning of the current year on these bonds was 6 compounded for an effective interest rate of = 1.03 × 1.03 1 the market interest rate remained at this level throughout the current year the bonds had a book value of $ 100,000 at the beginning of the current year when the firm made the payment at the end of the first six months of the current year the accountant debited a liability for the exact amount of cash paid compute the amount of interest expense on these bonds for the last six months of the life of the bonds assuming all bonds remain outstanding until the retirement date   my question is why would they give me the effective interest rate for both the historical and current rate   the problem states that the firm accounts for the bond using historical interest which is 10 semiannual and the coupon payments are twice per year   i was just wondering if i should just do the beginning balance which is 100000 in this case x balance so on and so forth until i get to the maturity value i got an answer of and was wondering if that 's the correct approach or not

i 'll assume united states as the country the answer may probably does vary somewhat if this is not correct   also i preface this with the caveat that i am neither a lawyer nor an accountant   however this is my understanding you must recognize the revenue at the time the credits are purchased when money changes hands and charge sales tax on the full amount at that time   this is because the customer has pre paid and purchased a service i.e. the credits which are units of time available in the application   this is clearly a complete transaction   the use of the credits is irrelevant   this is equivalent to a customer purchasing a box of widgets for future delivery the payment is made and the widgets are available but have simply not been shipped and therefore used   this mirrors many online service providers say netflix in business model    this is different from the case in which a customer purchases a gift card or debit card   in this case sales tax is not collected because this is technically not a purchase   revenue is also not booked at this time   instead the revenue is booked when the gift card 's balance is used to pay for a good or service and at that time the tax is collected usually from the funds on the card   to do otherwise would greatly complicate the tax basis suppose the gift card is used in a different state or county where sales tax is charged differently   suppose the gift card is used to purchase a tax exempt item   for justification see bankruptcy consideration of the two cases   in the former the customer has ownership of an asset the credits which can not be taken from him although it might be unusable   in the latter the holder of the debit card is technically an unsecured creditor of the company and is last in line if the company 's assets are liquidated for repayment    consider also the case where the cost of the credits is increased part way through the year say from $ 10 per credit to $ 20 per credit or if a discount promotion is applied buy 5 credits get one free   the customer has a tangible item one credit which gets the same functionality regardless of price   this would be different if instead of credits you instead maintain an account where the user deposited $ 1000 and was billed for usage in this case you fall back to the gift card scenario but usage is charged at the current rate and revenue is booked when the usage is purchased similarly tax is collected on the purchase of the service   for this model to work the credit would likely have to be refundable and could not expire see gift cards above and must be usable on a variety of services   you may have particular responsibility in the handling of this deposit as well

yea i agree with this but i do think that amazon benefits a lot more from   economies of scale than uber both are platform models where you get more profits by having more users however its a lot more difficult to compete with amazon because of their warehouses inventory delivery speed etc etc than it is to compete with uber essentially has no inventory of its own there is a cap to how much uber can charge on either side before it is profitable to enter the market and compete with uber furthermore uber has completely lost countries such as china so there is a limit to their top line also uber still has to fight its never ending stream of litigation and that not just adds risk to the buisness but is a huge cost on uber when it comes down to it besides from the convenience of booking a ride from your phone uber saves money by going around the fact that the drivers in uber do not need taxi licences and that directly cuts into government revenue so far there has nt been too much resistance but it is hard to say if it will remain the case in the future
