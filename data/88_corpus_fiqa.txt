in the equity markets the p e is usually somewhere around 15   the p e can be viewed as the inverse of the rate of a perpetuity since the average is 15 and the e p of that would be 6.7 r should be 6.7 on average if your business is growing the growth rate can be incorporated like so as you can see a high g would make the price negative in essence the seller should actually pay someone to take the business but in reality r is determined from the p and an estimated g. for a business of any growth rate it 's best to compare the multiple to the market so for the average business in the market with your business 's growth rate and industry that p e would be best applied to your company 's income

thanks for your reply i think a lot of people are confused when talking about ownership and i think it is a issue    when a company issues stock the first time or anytime what they are doing is selling the right to a percentage of the dividend they are not actually selling parts of the company to you everyone thinks this way though and that has to do with the chicago school economists who perpetuated their ideas of ownership which is what everyone know thinks is the case this way of thinking about corporations and ownership is just wrong not ethically just erroneous    as i stated before of cornell university explains this really well i would encourage anyone to read more about it

it is important to first understand that true causation of share price may not relate to historical correlation just like with scientific experiments correlation does not imply causation but we use stock price correlation to attempt to infer causation where it is reasonable to do so and to do that you need to understand that prices change for many reasons some company specific some industry specific some market specific companies in the same industry may correlate when that industry goes up or down companies with the same market may correlate when that market goes up or down in general in most industries it is reasonable to assume that competitor companies have stocks which strongly correlate positively with each other to the extent that they do the same thing   for a simple example consider three resource companies oil ltd. 100 of its assets relate to oil oil and iron inc. 50 of its value relates to oil 50 to iron and iron and copper ltd. 50 of its value relates to iron 50 to copper for each of these companies there are many things which affect value but one could naively simplify things by saying value of a resource company is defined by the expected future volume of goods mined drilled the expected resource price less all fixed and variable costs so one major thing that impacts resource companies is simply the current projected price of those resources this means that if the price of oil goes up or down it will partially affect the value of the two oil companies above but how much it affects each company will depend on the volume of oil it and the timeline that it expects to get that oil for example maybe oil and iron ltd. has no currently producing oil rigs but it has just made massive investments which expect to drill oil in 2 years and the market expects oil prices to return to a high value in 2 years   in that case a drop in oil would impact oil inc. severely but perhaps it would n't impact oil and iron ltd. as much in this case for the particular share price movement related to the price of oil the two companies would not be correlated iron and copper ltd. would be unaffected by the price of oil this is a simplification oil prices impact many areas of the economy and therefore there would be no correlation at all between this company 's shares it is also likely that competitors face similar markets if consumer spending goes down then perhaps the stock of most consumer product companies would go down as well there would be outliers because specific companies may still succeed in a falling market but in generally there would be a lot of correlation between two companies with the same market   in the case that you list sony vs samsung there would be some factors that correlate positively and some that correlate negatively a clean example would be blackberry stock vs apple stock because apple 's success had specifically negative ramifications for blackberry and yet other tech company competitors also succeeded in the same time period meaning they did not correlate negatively with apple

a possibility could be real estate brokerage firms such as or although a brokerage commission is linked to the sale prices it is more directly impacted by sales volume if volume is maintained or goes up a real estate brokerage firm can actually profit rather handsomely in an up market or a down market   if sales volume does go up another option would be other service markets for real estate such as real estate information and marketing websites and sources i.e. furthermore one can go and make a broad generalization such as since real estate no longer requires the same quantity of construction material other industries sensitive to the price of those commodities should technically have a lower cost of doing business but be careful in the us much of the wealth an average american has is in their home in this case this means that the economy as a whole takes a dive due to consumer uncertainty in which case safe havens could benefit may be things like gamble gold or treasuries side note you can always short builders or someone who loses if the housing market declines this will make your investment higher as a result of the security going lower

i could be mistaken but since card 1 and card 2 have the same interest rate it does n't matter which one you pay more towards both in terms of time it will take you to pay it down and how much interest you pay basically you 'll be paying $ each month towards a total debt of $ at 2 irrespective of how you divide the payments up over the cards just make sure you observe minimum payment requirements   the situation would be different if they had different interest rates or if the low rate on one of them would expire quicker than on the other one

like all financial investments the value of a bond is the present value of expected future cash flows   the yield to maturity is the annualized return you get on your initial investment which is equivalent to the discount rate you 'd use to discount future cash flows so if you discount all future cashflows at 6 annually you can calculate the price of the bond so the price of a $ 1,000 bond which is how bond prices are typically quoted would be $ the current yield is just the current coupon payment divided by the current price which is or question 3 makes no sense since the yield to maturity would be the same if you bought the bond at market price question 4 talks about a sale date which makes me think that it assumes you sold the bond on the coupon date but you 'd have to know the sale price to calculate the rate of return

i recently requested an off schedule escrow analysis we refinanced a house in august and the servicer got confused about when the home owner 's insurance was due in october they refunded the insurance money to us in september that combined with the fact that the insurance amount was different than what they expected made me request the escrow analysis that way i can decide whether to pay up the escrow account now or do it over the next year the servicer agent just said that the monthly payment amounts might change again in january when they do the usual analysis if you like to set up automatic payments that would be a downside i have n't done that yet so not a problem for me

the biggest and primary question is how much money you want to live on within retirement the lower this is the more options you have available you will find that while initially complex it does n't take much planning to take complete advantage of the tax system if you are intending to retire early are there any other investment accounts that are geared towards retirement or long term investing and have some perk associated with them tax deferred tax exempt but do not have an age restriction when money can be withdrawn   i 'm going to answer this with some potential alternatives the us tax system currently is great for people wanting to early retire if you can save significant money you can optimize your taxes so much over your lifetime if you retire early and have money invested in a roth ira or a traditional 401k that money ca n't be touched without penalty until you 're let 's ignore roth contributions that can technically be withdrawn ok the 401k myth the i 'm hosed if i put money into it since it 's stuck perspective is n't true for a variety of reasons if you retire early you get a long amount of time to take advantage of retirement accounts one way is to primarily contribute to pretax 401k during working years after retiring begin converting this at a very low tax rate you can convert money in a traditional ira whenever you want to be roth you just pay your marginal tax rate which for an early retiree might be 0 then after 5 years you now have a chunk of principle that has become roth principle and can be withdrawn whenever let 's imagine you retire at 40 with 100k in your 401k pretax for 5 years you convert $ 20k assuming married because we get $ 20k between exemptions deduction it means you pay $ 0 taxes every year while converting $ 20k of your pretax ira to roth or if you have kids even more after 5 years you now can withdraw that 20k year 100 tax free since it has become principle this is only a good idea when you are retired early because you are able to fill up all your free income for tax conversions when you are working you would be paying your marginal rate but your marginal rate in retirement is 0 related thread on a forum you might enjoy this is sometimes called a roth pipeline basically assuming you have no income while retired early you can fairly simply convert traditional ira money into roth principle this is then accessible to you well before the age but you get the full benefit of the pretax money but let 's pretend you do n't want to do that you need the money and tax benefit now how beneficial is it to do traditional 401ks imagine you live in a state city where you are paying 25 marginal tax rate if your expected marginal rate in your early retirement is 10 15 you are still better off putting money into your 401k and just paying the 10 penalty on an early withdrawal in many cases for high earners this can actually still be a tax benefit overall the point is this just because you have to work to get money out of a 401k early does not mean you lose the tax benefits of it in fact current tax code really does let an early retiree have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the roth traditional 401k ira question are you limited to a generic taxable brokerage account currently a huge perk for those with small incomes is that long term capital gains are taxed based on your current federal tax bracket if your federal marginal rate is 15 or less you will pay nothing for long term capital gains until this income pushes you into the 25 federal bracket   this might change but right now means you can capture many capital gains without paying taxes on them this is huge for early retirees who can manipulate income you can have significant income and not pay taxes on it you can also stack this with before mentioned roth conversions convert traditional ira money until you would begin owing any federal taxes then capture long term capital gains until you would pay tax on those combined this can represent a huge amount of money per year so littleadv mentioned hsas but for an early retiree they can be ridiculously good what this means is you can invest the maximum into your hsa for 10 years let it grow 100 tax free and save all your medical receipts etc then in 10 years start withdrawing that money while it sucks healthcare costs so much in america you might as well take advantage of the tax opportunities to make it suck slightly less there are many online communities dedicated to learning and optimizing their lives in order to achieve early retirement the question you are asking can be answered in the above but for a comprehensive plan you might want other resources some you might enjoy

have a bank account here you need to have a credit history that is wrong whoever informed you that you do n't need a credit history to open a bank account some banks allow you to open no frills accounts without a credit history i myself opened an account with barclays with my ni card job contract and probably my passport too and i from the eu also the bank that allowed me to open the account does n't allow me to wire transfer my money to another uk account and claims that ll the bank have the same policy for cash accounts is that true i mean is there an actual law that for some reason allow you to transfer your funds why did you read the t&cs chances are that other the account is with a different bank and it always is fishy atleast for banks because of heightened money laundering regulations for people opening accounts and starting to transfer money to accounts with other banks after you have banked with them for certain time you can ask them to upgrade you to a current account which allow these services secondly because it might be a no frills account and they are n't allowed to charge fees they might disallow transfers to other banks and banks generally do n't charge fees for no frills accounts so certain services are disallowed which cost them money i have had a cash account for 4 5 years with barclays and i used to transfer money to other banks but i probably never tried transferring money just after opening an account

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you

the difference is that for the one year time frame the data is represented based on daily data and the sma is 20 days whilst for the 5 year timeframe the data is automatically represented as weekly data with the sma represented by 20 weeks not 20 days anymore this happens due to daily data on this chart being too much data to represent over a 5 year period so the data defaults to weekly data over such a long period if the chart is represented as weekly data then any indicators will also have to be represented in weekly data if you use a more sophisticated charting program you can actually select to see daily or weekly data over longer periods such as 5 years or more

those choices are n't mutually exclusive   yes most discussion of the mortgage interest deduction ignores the fact that for a standard much if not all of this deduction can be lost   for 2011 the std deduction for a single is $ 5,800 it 's not just mortgage interest that 's deductible state income tax tax and charitable contributions are among the other deductions if this house is worth $ 350 k the property tax is about $ 5 k and since it 's not optional i 'd be inclined to assume that it 's the deduction that offsets the std deduction most states have an income tax which tops off the rest you are welcome to toss this aside as but i view it as these other deductions as lost first   i 'm married and our property tax is more than our standard deduction so when doing the math the mortgage is fully deductible as are our contributions   in your case the numbers may play out differently no state tax great so it 's the property tax and deductions you 'd add up first and decide on the value the mortgage deduction brings   last i do n't have my mortgage for the deduction i just believe that long term my other investments will exceed after tax the cost of that mortgage

yes w4 determines how much your employer will withhold from your wages leaving everything at default would mean that your salary is your only taxable income and you only take default deductions your employee will calculate your tax withholding based on that but if your salary is > 200k i assume that you have other income investment capital gains interest on your bank account which you will have to pay taxes on you 're probably going to have some deductible expenses business partnership expenses mortgage interest donations college funds etc as well so it is very likely unless you 're really not smart about money that you have more to do with your taxes than just the employers withholding

gt let 's just say the insurance industry knows a lot more about underwriting than you do   i 'm sorry but that is a meaningless statement i work in insurance first as a consultant before retiring to work in insurance distribution a few years ago and i know that our industry frequently uses flawed or outdated methodologies due to the simple fact that insurance companies are very conservative and very resistant to change when it comes to changes to their core business unless you can show a direct negative impact on the bottom line caused by the currently used method you are unlikely to make any changes at all in this case if the entire us car insurance industry is using the same flawed system it wo n't affect a single company if they also stick to it    until 1996 before the current system was introduced insurance companies in germany used to rate liability insurance for cars almost exclusively by engine power output the industry had known that this method was fundamentally flawed since at least the late 1980s comprehensive and partial coverage had been rated by the new system for a few years at this point which had also taken years to work out but it took additional years of planning negotiations and cooperation by the entire industry to change to the new system for liability    so please do not ever assume that the insurance companies are the experts they know what they are doing it might very well be the case that they are stuck with flawed outdated systems simply because there is no sufficiently strong impulse to change what they do    the current tesla rate adjustment situation is a wonderful example of this it took aaa 5 years since the model s first came out to realise that their initial estimate was wrong it seems unlikely that the accident rate or repair costs have suddenly changed over the last year and take appropriate actions by late 2013 there were easily enough teslas on the road about 20,000 to get data yet nothing happened for nearly another 4 years

sure but as a retail client you 'd be incurring transaction fees on entry and exit do you have the necessary tools to manage all the corporate actions too and index rebalances    etf managers add value by taking away the monstrous web of clerical work associated with managing a portfolio of at times hundreds of different names with this comes the value of institutional brokerage commissions data licenses etc i think if you were to work out the actual brokerage cost as well as the time you 'd have to spend doing it yourself you 'd find that just buying the etf is far cheaper   also a bit of a rabbit hole but how would you with traditional retail client tools even coordinate the simultaneous purchase of all 500 components of something like spy i would guess that on average you 're going to have significantly worse slippage to the index than a typical etf provider add that into your calculation too

in my experience even with such pos machines there is a display that asks you to confirm your total as a very last step even if they ask if you want a receipt as a first step by this manner it would be nearly impossible for the teller to change the total without you noticing so long as you read the total given to you by the device   the scam in question is more likely to happen in a restaurant with the additional tip segment allowing someone to give themselves more of a tip than you initially wrote onto the receipt this is the only way i believe you would have a feasible chance of being cheated like this

keynes is hard to defend he makes some very basic errors in the core of his work however the best defense of keynes at least with respect to his intellectual contribution is roger time amp money argument is that keynes is right if you dismiss time as an irrelevant variable time is a complicated issue and keynes was brilliant in the way he managed to describe an economy that exists outside of time   keynes more or less admits that the solution is very short term with long term harm he just does n't think the long term problems are all that bad i really do n't think he would defend what his work has been twisted to advocate

your plan will work to increase your total credit capacity good for your credit score and reduce your utilization also good   as mentioned you will need to be careful to use these cards periodically or they will get closed but it will work the question is whether this will help you or not   in addition to credit capacity and utilization your credit score looks at things like these factors may hurt you as you continue to open accounts   you can easily get to the stage where your score is not benefitting much from increased capacity and it is getting hurt a lot by pulls and low average age btw you are correct that closing accounts generally hurts your score   it probably reduces average age may reduce maximum age reduces your capacity and increases your utilization

note i am making a usa assumption here keep in mind this answer does n't necessarily apply to all countries or even states in the usa   you asked two questions i 'm looking to buy a property i do not want to take a risk on this    property its sole purpose is to provide me with a place to live how    would i go about hedging against increasing interest rates to counter    the increasing mortgage costs to counter increasing interest rates obtaining a fixed interest rate on a mortgage is the answer if that 's available   as far as costs for a mortgage that depends as mortgages are tied to the value of the property home   if you want a place to live a piece of property and want to hedge against possible rising interest rates a fixed mortgage would work for these goals ideally i 'd like to not lose money on my property seeing as i will be    borrowing 95 of the property 's value so i 'd like to hedge against    interest rates and falling property prices in order to have a risk    neutral position on my property now we have a different issue   for instance if someone had opened a fixed mortgage on a home for $ 500,000 and the housing value plummeted 50 or more the person may still have a fixed interest rate protecting the person from higher rates but that does n't protect the property value   in addition to that if the person needed to move for a job that person would face a difficult choice move and sell at a loss or move and rent and face some complications renting is generally a good idea for people who 1 have not determined if they 'll be in an area for more than 5 10 years 2 want the flexibility to move if their living costs rises which may be an issue if they lose wages 3 do n't want to pay property taxes varies by state homeowner 's insurance or maintenance costs 4 enjoy regular negotiation something which renters can do before re signing a lease or looking for a new place to live   again other conditions can apply to people who favor renting such as someone might enjoy living in one room out of a house rather than a full apartment or a person who likes a change of scenes and moves from one apartment to another for a fresh perspective but these are smaller exceptions but with renting you have nothing to re sell and no financial asset so far as a property is concerned thus why some real estate agents refer to it as throwing away money which is n't necessarily true but one should be aware that the money they invest in renting does n't go into an asset that can be re sold

i think you may be confused on terminology here financial leverage is debt that you have taken on in order to invest it increases your returns because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own   example if a $ 1,000 mutual fund investment returns $ 60 6 then you could also take on $ 1,000 of debt at 3 interest and earn $ 120 from both mutual fund investments paying $ 30 in interest leaving you with a net $ 90 9 of your initial $ 1,000 however if the mutual fund takes a nose dive and loses money you still need to pay the $ 30 interest in this way using financial leverage actually increases your risk it may provide higher returns but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount in the example above imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed and was worth nothing now you would have lost $ 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place and you would also still owe $ 1,000 to the bank the key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates if you ever feel you have a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns check your math again as an addendum if instead what you plan on doing is investing say 90 of your money in money market type funds and 10 in the stock market then this is a good way to reduce your risk however it also reduces your returns as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market once again being safer with your investments leads to less return that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interest earning low risk investments is often advised 99 is basically the same as 100 however so you almost do n't benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market

first i 'd recommend that you separate short term assets from long term assets in your head   short term assets are earmarked for spending on something specific in the near future or are part of your emergency fund   these should be kept in cash or short bond funds    long term assets are assets that you can take some risks with and are n't going to spend in the next few years   under normal circumstances i 'd recommend 80 bonds or even 70/30 for someone your age assuming you 're saving mainly for retirement and thus have a correspondingly long time horizon   these portfolios historically are much less risky than 100 stock and only return slightly less    right now though i think that anyone who does n't absolutely need safety keep 100 of their long term assets in stocks   i 'm 26 and this is my asset allocation   bond yields are absolutely pathetic by historical standards   even ten year treasury yields are comparable to s&p 500 dividend yields and likely wo n't outperform inflation if held to maturity   the stock market is modestly undervalued when measured by difference between current p e ratio and the historical average and more severely undervalued when you account for the effects of reduced inflation transaction costs and capital gains taxes on fair valuation   therefore the potential reward for taking risk is much higher now than it usually is

the answer will vary person to person and situation to situation   but the basic concept to always consider is this   what interest rate am i paying on my debt 10 18   and what interest rate am i making on my savings investment etc 3 7   it wo n't give you a hard and fast answer but will definitely let you know if you should take a closer look at it   i 'd suggest talking to a financial planner about it   find a fee based planner that you can turn to to make sure you are on the right track not a commission based planner a fee based one   with respectful apologies to any commission based planners who may read this my instinct is usually to pay off the debt try to clean everything up so you do n't have anything outstanding that is charging you interest   debt is clutter it 's stressful it can be a reminder of money you wish you had n't spent   as long as you have access to money in case of emergency job loss etc get your debt paid off and keep it paid off   you 'll sleep much better

if markets were perfectly efficient the price should reflect everything that is currently known about the future of a commodity   if it is known that silver is currently under valued then investors would be buying it driving the price up   conversely if silver is currently over valued then investors would be selling and the price would be going down   added to that is emotion   if the price is currently trending up then people expect it to keep going up and the price continues to rise   until enough people think it ca n't go any higher and start selling which drives the price down   since this is driven by emotion it can not be predicted when this will happen

i think you got the message mixed up a little racking up big balances can hurt your scores regardless of whether you pay your bills in full each month    what 's typically reported to the credit bureaus and thus calculated into your scores are the balances reported on your last statements that does n't mean paying off your balances each month is n't financially smart it is just that the credit scores do n't care    you typically can increase your scores by limiting your charges to 30 or less of a card 's limit from 7 ways to fix your credit score in other words always pay off your balance if you can but do n't fill up your card to the max of your credit limit each month i.e. if your credit limit is $ 5000 only spend $ 2000 each month

i 'll start by saying that if this is being explored to scratch a specific itch you have then great if this was a cold call it 's probably safe to ignore it certain whole life products they vary in quality by carrier can make sense for very high earners who are looking for additional tax preferred places to store money   so after you ira 401(k etc options are maxed out but you still have income you 'd like to hide from taxes whole life can be a potential vehicle because gains and death benefit are generally exempt from income taxes   be on the look out for loads charged to your money as it comes in to the policy   life insurance in general is meant to keep your dependents going without having to sell off assets in the event of your death   people may plan for things like school tuition mortgage property tax for your spouse   if you own a business with a couple of partners it 's somewhat common for the partners to buy policies on each other to buyout a spouse to avoid potential operating conflicts   sometimes there can be estate planning issues if you 're looking to transfer assets when you ultimately pass it can make sense to form a trust and load cash in to a whole life policy because death benefits can be shielded from income tax and the estate tax calculation the current estate tax exemption is about $ 5.5 million today judging from your numbers you might actually be close to that including the net value of the homes   obviously though the tax rules are subject to change and you need to be deliberate in your formation of the trust in order to effectively navigate estate tax issues   you seem to have a very solid financial position from this perspective it looks like your spouse would be in good shape    if you are specifically attempting to manage potential estate tax liability you should probably involve an financial planner with experience forming and managing trusts and you should be very involved with the process because it will absolutely make your finances more complicated

i think you are trying to figure out what will be a break even rental rate for you so that then you can decide whether renting at current market rates is worth it for you this is tricky to determine because future valuations are uncertain you can make rough estimates though the most uncertain component is likely to be capital appreciation or depreciation increase or decrease in the value of your property this is usually a relatively large number significant to the calculation the value is uncertain because it depends on predictions of the housing market future interest rates or economic conditions will likely play a major role in dictating the future value of your home obviously there are numerous other costs to consider such as maintenance tax and insurance some of which may be via escrow and included in your mortgage payment largest uncertainty in terms of income are the level of rent and occupancy rate the former is reasonably predictable the latter less so   would advise you make a spreadsheet and list them all out with margins of error to get some idea the absolute amount you are paying on the mortgage is a red herring similar to when car dealers ask you what payment you can afford that 's not what 's relevant what 's relevant is the net present value of all the payments in relation to what you are getting in return note that one issue with assessing your cost of capital is what 's your opportunity cost ie if you did n't have the money tied up in real estate what could you be earning with it elsewhere this is not really part of the cost of capital but it 's something to consider also note that the total monthly payment for the mortgage is not useful to your calculations because a significant chunk of the payment will likely be to pay down principal and as such represents no real cost to you its really just a transfer reducing your bank balance but increasing your equity in the home the interest portion is a real cost to you

maybe you know something i do n't but as far as i 'm aware you ca n't get rid of it   student loans are with you for   you will be sent to collections but it does n't disappear after 7 years   settlements are incredibly rare unless your loan is ballooning in which case a settlement does n't change all that much   you will lose tax benefits the government will garnish 15 of your wages and you will be a debt slave until it 's paid off   defaulting on student loans is much much more painful than defaulting on private loans   the only exception to this is if you 've made 120 months of repayments while employed at a qualifying non profit or governmental organization   and even then it only applies to federal loans and there are exceptions better not refinance or the clock resets for example   also if you default you will no longer be eligible   private student loans have no escape and are equally   thank your elected representatives

you can certainly borrow from your parents and they can take out a loan under their own names if you can persuade them to do so that really is the best solution i can think of for a loan to a minor assuming that your parents think the trip is important enough to justify the cost and commitment of taking out a loan at all if they do n't they would n't co sign for a loan either other than that i think the simple answer is no you are probably going to have to find some other way to raise the money or delay the trip yes theoretically there are things that can be done with them guaranteeing a loan on your behalf but at your age i do n't know whether you would be considered legally competent to sign that agreement in most jurisdictions and realistically it winds up being no less risky for your parents than the approach i suggested since they 're still on the hook if you ca n't repay in time

there are several issues with paying for furniture and appliances with 0 credit instead of paying with cash when you pay with 0 credit you might be tempted to spend more on something than you would have if you paid with cash because it feels like free money and you 've justified in your mind that the extra you earn will help pay for the more expensive item businesses do n't offer 0 credit for free and they do n't lose money on the deal   when you shop at a store that offers 0 credit you are generally overpaying for the item   by shopping at a store that does not offer 0 credit you might be able to get a better price your savings account is likely earning very little interest   you might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed and you might not do as well as you think 0 loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments   you can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments but things can still go wrong   your bank might change your account number making the automated payment fail   as you mentioned you might also forget to put the proper amount of money in the account   a single mistake can negate all of the tiny gains you are trying to achieve ultimately the decision is yours of course but in my opinion there is very very little to gain with buying something on 0 credit when you could be paying cash

only you can decide whether it 's wise or not given your own personal circumstances brexit is certainly a big risk and noone can really know what will happen yet the specific worries you mention are certainly valid additionally you might find it hard to keep your job or get a new one if the economy turns bad and in an extreme no deal scenario you might find yourself forced to leave though i think that 's very unlikely house prices could also collapse leaving you in negative equity if you 're planning on staying in the same location in the uk for a long time a house tends to be a worthwhile investment particularly as you always need somewhere to live so owning it is a hedge against prices rising even if prices do fall you do still have somewhere to live if you 're planning on going back to your home country at some point that reduces the value of owning a house if you want to reduce your risk consider getting a mortgage with a long term fixed rate there are some available for 10 years which i 'd hope would be enough to get us over most of the brexit volatility

at twenty two you can have anywhere between of your securities portfolio in equities it is reasonable to start at 100 and reduce over time   the one thing that i would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70 bonds   you should never have more than 30 bonds   why   because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100 bonds and will give a higher return   absent some market timing strategy which as an amateur investor you should absolutely avoid or some complicated balancing scheme there is never a reason to be at more than 30 bonds    a 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100 bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix it is actually riskier   why   because sometimes bonds fall   and when they do stocks generally gain   and vice versa   because of this behavior the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50 or 100 bonds    does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70   no   if your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70   the problem is that when you drop stocks below 70 you should drop bonds below 30 as well   so you keep the stock to bond ratio at    if you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix then you should move into cash equivalents   cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination   but at twenty two you do n't really need more safety    at twenty two the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund   this should be able to handle six months of expenses without income   i recommend making it equal to six months of your income   the reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses   also you can save six months of income at twenty two    are you going to stay where you are for the next five years   at twenty two the answer is almost certainly no   but the standard is the five year time frame   if you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work then no   if you stay somewhere at least five years then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses   less than five years the reverse is true   so you should probably rent now    you can max out your 401k and ira now   doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty seven   and perhaps more importantly it helps keep your spending down   the less you do spend the less you will feel that you need to spend    once you fill your emergency fund start building savings for a house   i would consider putting them in a real estate investment trust reit   a reit will tend to track real estate   since you want to buy real estate with the results this is its own kind of safety   it fell in value   houses are probably cheap   houses increasing in price rapidly   a reit is probably growing by leaps and bounds   you do this outside your retirement accounts as you want to be able to access it without penalty

it means a 3 return on the value of the stock if a stock has a $ 10 share price the dividend would be $ 0.30 normally though the dividends are announced as a fixed amount per share because the share price fluctuates if a percentage were announced then the final cost would not be known as the share priced could change radically before the dividend date

well that is not entirely accurate but the sentiment is true if jeff himself liquidated the stock it would cause concern because he is the driving force at amazon but whether or not the stock price is driven up or down is more about where demand meets supply rather than simply supply    for example almost every time a company buys out a public corporation they pay a premium for the exact opposite effect you 're talking about though it 's the same logic if you are wanted to sell 40 of a company you owned you would likely do it this way    if jeff announced he   was retiring and had good leadership set into place after him and then created a buyout of his 40 he would likely get 30 50 more than the stock is currently worth so there are a lot of factors

all of the other answers here are accurate but i think are missing the point as to the question which rests on how bonds work in the first place the bond specifies a payback amount and date let 's say it is $ 10,000 and one year from today if you buy that today for $ your yield will be 1 if you buy it today for $ 11,000 your yield will be less than 0 please do n't make me do the math it 's just under negative 1 you might be willing to pay that 1 rather than receive 1 for the certainty that you will definitely get your money back the combined actions of all the people who may be willing to pay a little more or a little less for the safety of a us treasury bond is what people call the market   market forces generally investor confidence will drive the price up and down which affects the yield all the other stuff coupons and inflation and whatnot all of that only makes sense if you understand that you are n't buying a rate of return you are buying a payback amount and date

gt say you repeal a tax without reducing public spending then if you analyze the economic impact that does not fairly represent the impact of the tax now does it   you are right but my issue is that you are accounting for changes that are not happening   if you are comparing a country 's tax structure before and after a wealth tax then i would agree however in this case all the subjects are separate economies and have presumably found some sort of equilibrium   the wealth tax policy is not changing for them so there is no surplus or deficit of public spending to adjust for

do not do investing with a bank   do investing with a low cost investment company like vanguard fidelity or charles schwab   the lower the expenses of the fund the better the additional money your account earns because of lower overhead expenses is so dramatic over the course of your investing it is mind boggling to me    the lower the expenses the more of your money you keep which feeds the power of compound interest

this was an interesting little article thanks for sharing it   however i 'm a bit by part of the analysis     the authors give some fairly substantial hints that the value they are providing is not the standard deviation but most of the respondents miss these hints   the answers for the annualized rate also suggest that many of the respondents knew how to compute this given the standard deviation   the authors then go on to say that basically all of the respondents gave the correct mathematical definition of the standard deviation   then they go on to say that   gt whatever reason there was for their error it did not result from ignorance of the concept   but this strikes me as both disingenuous and incorrect   on the contrary the most likely explanation would seem to be that most of them were not aware of the concept of mean absolute deviation probably because they had either never learned it or never had occasion to apply it   i agree that people even highly trained people tend to be very bad at probability just look up the hall problem for a primer on that   but i strongly disagree with the notion that this paper provides any evidence of this tendency as there seems to be a much stronger case for ignorance   this alternative is further supported by the authors assertion that   gt with respondents revealed that they rarely had an immediate understanding of the error when it was pointed out to them   again suggesting ignorance as the most not least likely culprit   i also found it odd that they asked the respondents specifically about the standard deviation definition but not about the mean absolute deviation despite the fact that the latter is almost certainly more obscure   to that last bit i just went through the textbooks i have on hand and this concept is not mentioned in either of the undergraduate statistics probability textbooks i own nor in the one undergraduate finance textbook i have   i 'm in machine learning and not finance but it is mentioned in just one of the four graduate level texts i have on applied statistics and probability once on one page in a textbook on bayesian statistics   and the wikipedia page is terrible   in short while this is an interesting little experiment and write up i think the analysis and conclusions are inappropriate and not supported by the evidence the authors provide   that does n't mean that their conclusions are incorrect just that i disagree with the notion that this paper them   this response ended up being way long

you can do either a 1099 or a w-2   there is no limitations to the number of w-2s one can have in reporting taxes   problems occur with the irs when one forgets to report income   even if one holds only one job at a time people typically have more than one w-2 if they change jobs within the year the w-2 is the simplest way to go and you may want to consider doing this if you do not intend to work this side business into significant income    however a 1099 gig is preferred by many in some situations   for things like travel expenses you will probably receive the income from these on a 1099 but you can deduct them from your income using a schedule c.   along these lines you may be able to deduct a wide variety of other things like travel to and from the client 's location equipment such as computers and office supplies and maybe a portion of your home internet bill   also this opens up different retirement contributions schemes such as a simplified employee pension    this does come with some drawbacks however   first your life is more complicated as things need to be documented to become actual business expenses   you are much more likely to be audited by the irs   your taxes become more complicated and it is probably necessary to employee a cpa to do them   if you do this for primary full time work you will have to buy your own benefits   most telling you will have to pay both sides of social security taxes on most profits   keep in mind that a good account can help you transfer profits to dividends which will allow you to be taxed at 15 and avoid social security taxes so it really comes down to what you see this side gig expanding into and your goals   if you want to make this a real business then go 1099 if you are just doing this for a months and a few thousand dollars go w-2

i did receive turbotax 's automatically generated confirmation of successfully completing tax filing electronically the day i did my tax on their web site about 24 to 48 hours after you push the button at turbotax the irs should either confirm or reject the initial check of the tax documents you should return to the turbotax website to make sure the irs has accepted the next review either the confirmation you received when you pushed the button or the information at the turbotax site it should specify when the money would be withdrawn you were given options regarding payment method and date you want to make the payment many people who finish their tax paperwork early but owe money wait until the last day to submit now it is possible to submit paperwork early but specify a date just before the deadline print out or even better save an electronic copy of the information at the turbotax website i have no idea how long it takes the irs to actually pull the money from an account once the day you specified has occurred you have to plan as if the withdraw will happen on the exact date but with millions of tax payers making transactions it may be delayed by a day or two

i was told if i moved my 401k into a roth ira that school purposes is one reasons you can withdraw money without having to pay a tax incorrect   you will need to pay tax on the amount converted since a 401(k is pre tax and a roth ira is after tax   it will be added to your regular income so you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate is there any hidden tax or fee at all for withdrawing money from a roth ira for educational purposes   you still will need to pay the tax on the amount converted but you 'll avoid the 10 penalty for early withdrawal i know that tuition books and fees are covered for educational purposes can i take out of my roth ira for living expenses while i 'm attending school rent gas food etc room and board yes so long as you are half time but not gas food   possibly only room and board for staying on campus but i 'm not certain although i doubt you could call your normal house payment education expense with my 401k being smaller would it just be better to go ahead and cash the whole thing and just pay the tax and use it for whatever i need it for what is the tax if i just decide to cash the whole thing in   you pay your marginal tax rate plus a 10 penalty for early withdrawal   so no this is probably not a wise move financially unless you 're on the verge of bankruptcy or foreclosure where distress costs are much higher then the 10 penalty i ca n't answer the other questions regarding grants i would talk to the financial aid department at your school bottom line transferring your 401(k is very likely a bad idea unless you can afford to pay the tax in cash meaning without borrowing   my advice would be to leave your 401(k alone it 's meant for retirement not for school or living expenses ideally you should pay for as much as you can out of cash flow and do n't take out more student loans that may mean taking fewer classes getting another part time job finding a different cheaper school applying for more grants and scholarships etc   i would not in any circumstance cash out your 401(k to pay for school   you 'll be much worse off in the long run and there are much cheaper ways to get money

no you have to reimburse the current mortgage you have and a new one for your new house a mortgage is a loan from a financial institution that accepts to give you money if you pay it back the total amount adding interests interests are the price you pay to the financial institution for it to give you money for a while in the mortgage you have an legal agreement with the financial institution on how to reimburse the total amount that is given to you for a while breaking that agreement is breaking the law the fact of the matter is that when 30 of your mortgage is reimbursed the financial institution own your house legally for real at 70 your live in the house own by the financial institution at 70 it is the same exact logic for a car loan the mortgage goes with a specific house at a legal address that you live in as a primary residence

you ca n't get your credit score for free just the report with the information the score is based on    if you got credit reports through annualcreditreport.com the score tab would typically contain an advertisement for purchasing your score   if you have an ad blocker enabled that might be blocked explaining the blank page   try turning off any browser extensions that alter how pages are shown    the accounts page tab section should show something like 0 open accounts or similar to indicate that it is loading data    your lack of credit history probably does mean you do n't have a credit score so it 's probably not worth paying anything to find that out   the focus should be on the accuracy of the underlying report since you can do something about that    should i be worried i 'd say no on that    you 'll have an easier time getting credit and better terms in the future if you start now with some account even if it 's a secured credit card you do n't use much because the age of the oldest and average accounts are factors in credit scoring models

phones set to automatically pick the carrier network will go bounce around a lot internationally probably due to signal strength the phones probably saw the other networks providing stronger signal and so they switched manually picking the network should prevent this from happening unless the network has towers on both sides of the border then there 's something fishy going on    i 'm not sure if verizon does it but at&amp;t messages you when you go somewhere not in your plan and tells you how much it will cost to use data and call that could have alerted these people to the issue before they were charged hundreds of dollars

house as investment is not a good idea besides the obvious calculations do n't forget the property tax home maintenance costs and time insurance costs etc there are a lot of hidden drains on the investment value of the house most especially the time that you have to invest in maintaining it on the other hand if you plan on staying in the area having children pets or like do home improvements landscaping gardening auto repair wood metal shopping then a house might be useful to you also consider the housing market where you are this gets a bit more difficult to calculate but if you have a high demand rental market then the house might make sense as an investment if you can rent it out for more than your monthly cost including all of those factors above but being a landlord is not for everyone again more of your time invested into the house you have to be prepared to go months without renting it you may have to deal with crazy people that will totally trash your house and threaten you if you complain and you may need to part with some of the rent to a management company if you need their skills or time it sounds like you are just not that interested right now that 's fine do n't rush invest your money some other way i.e. the stock market more than likely when you are ready for a house or to bail your family out of trouble if that 's what you choose to do you 'll have even more assets to do either with

if it makes you feel any better i now bank with a credit union these wf assholes called me one day to tell me that someone had tried to withdraw $ 500 from my account and that i needed to sign up for a more secure account of course with a $ 16 monthly charge so i did what anybody would do went to the bank and ask questions right after i got there and mention the problem they told me that nothing was wrong with my account that no transactions were attempted and even if they did attempt them and were canceled they would still show up but they did n't few minutes later i got another call from that guy and he was telling me that the problem was taken care of and that i did n't need to go to the bank after that i was just suspicious basically what it came down to was that somebody was trying to set me up for accounts that i did n't ask for just so he can get promoted at my expense they gave me a opportunity to report him but i did n't because i knew him personally he was one of my friends and at the time he had two kids i did n't want him to lose his job i told him that what he did was completely fucked up and that you do n't do that to people outside of wf that same day i withdrew all my money i still remember cutting the conversation short after wf tried to convince me all kinds of ways not to do that i been with a credit union about 3 years now and so far so good

gt the best teachers make hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in private educational institutions   1 i am sure some teachers do and that these teachers are far better than average but teacher pay correlates with a lot of other things like seniority    2 education is not just one thing and it is sometimes closer to a private good and sometimes closer to a public wiki education as status is a private good which is why private schools can afford to pay prestige bringing teachers a lot of money education as human capital is in some cases also a private good e.g. most of the benefits for graduate business education accrues to the student so externalities are negligible but in other cases it is probably not e.g. it 's better for everyone if everyone else is literate and so there are externalities involved in basic education and civic education is an almost public good the benefits of voting only exist if many people do it and they are spread largely evenly throughout society   right now the government has a hand in funding all of these this may or may not be a good idea whether from the standpoint of pure efficiency or from the taxation is theft   but in your opinion which of the above educations could plausibly be funded adequately without taxation   edit fixed link

i 'm pretty sure you already know this so i 'm probably just wasting time you know i ca n't think of a better analogy to the whole global warming debate than this 97 number a misleading statistic that means nothing is used to mislead the public the origin of this number was a survey of over 10,000 earth scientists in climate related fields a few years back first it was a non scientific survey and only 3000 people bothered to respond the two questions were   the first when compared with levels do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen fallen or remained relatively constant few would be expected to dispute this the planet began out of the little ice age in the middle 19th century the industrial revolution that was the period since the last real ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago 97 of skeptics would answer yes to this   the 2nd do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures so what constitutes significant does changing include both cooling and warming and for both better and worse and which contributions does this include land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation once again many skeptics would answer yes   surprisingly of the 3000 respondents only 82 answered yes to both questions so there is your real consensus well this was n't acceptable of course so they through the 3000 and found 79 that they classified as climate scientists 76 of 79 responded yes to the first question what the heck we have real published scientists who do n't even think the earth has warmed so then 2 of the 3 who answered no to the first question did n't answer the second question i think it is fair to say that if they think there was no warming then they did n't feel that mankind had contributed but for the survey they just reported 75 of 77 97 plus responded yes to the 2nd question so even using their own picking of a subset of 3000 that got the answer they wanted they still cheated and reported the 97 statistic since the honest 95 answer did n't sound good enough to them now that 's the true origin of the statistic and you could probably get 90 of skeptics to agree to the two questions   and none of the questions address the real thing being debated what is the real feedback going to be from co2 warming you ca n't even get a consensus on whether it will be positive or negative

evaluate if the rs 5 million term insurance is sufficient typically the term insurance provided by employer is in the range of 1 to 3 times the gross generally one should be covered in the range of 5 to 10 times the gross the sooner you start the lesser the premium and you can get insured for a large amount for a long duration at very nominal rate   note   you can also buy a health insurance for your father note these typically come at high cost generally if over 70 years of age 25 is the premium amount and 25 as co pay so if your dad does n't fall ill once in 3 years its a loss making proposition edit accident insurance best take is along with rider on term plan additional health insurance is a good idea and helps if you are in between jobs plus the new company health insurance can reject a particular treatment as pre existing i.e. certain illness in certain plans require one to have coverage for 3 years before the claim for it can be covered

assuming the data you 're referring to is this line the difference might be related to the different exchanges on which the stock trades   finra could be listing the reported volume from one exchange while the nasdaq data might be listing the volume on all exchanges this is an important distinction because is a canadian company that is listed on the toronto stock exchange and the nyse the q at the end of the line stands for nasdaq according to finra 's for those data my guess is that the finra data is only reporting the volume for the nasdaq exchange and not the total volume for all exchanges toronto nasdaq nyse etc while the data straight from nasdaq oddly enough is reporting the total volume however finra could also face reporting discrepancies since it 's a regulatory body and therefore might not have the most up to date volume data that the various exchanges can access   i do n't know if it 's related or not but looking at the nasdaq historical data it looks like the volume on march 6 the day you 're asking about was much lower than the volume in most of the days immediately before or after it for all i know something might have happened that day concerning that particular stock or the market as a whole i do n't remember anything in particular but you never know

i do n't believe there is such a process   my observation i.e. my opinion is that banks will have a level of security walls appropriate to the cost vs risk they experience since as says your liability is limited for this type of fraud you personally bear little if any risk   if this fraud were common enough that the cost of your proposal outweighed the expense they would implement it   on a similar note credit card fraud can be reduced ten fold if a pin were required for all purchases the 3 digits on the back helps prove the card is there and you just did n't steal the from 16 digits but a 6 8 digit pin required at point of sale would be tough for the thief to guess how much software to do this would cost i do n't know but the idea is brilliant even if it 's mine 10 fold reduction if not 100 fold any bank guys reading

i think your best bet here would be hsbc   they will provide the required currencies credit debit cards and very easy to use online banking transfers   this includes an online global account view which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to drag and drop money between accounts regarding fees i suspect you will need to be a premier account holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies   in my experience hsbc offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging large amounts of money greater than $ 10,000 gbp 5,000   exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer in my experience exchanging gbp 5000 will have a spread of about percent while exchanging more than will have a spread of as little as percent in order to qualify for a premier account if my memory of hsbc uk serves me correctly you will need to have at least gbp 50,000 net across all of your hsbc managed accounts including and other investment accounts in order to open a banking swiss account you will need to travel to switzerland and apply in person   you can not open a foreign bank account remotely   with a foreign investment account i believe you can open accounts remotely   for example i opened an account with fidelity switzerland using my fidelity uk account directly from the uk however obviously fidelity does not provide banking services so this is not of interest to you the simplest thing to do is to visit your local hsbc branch and discuss it with them in person other uk banks such as barclays will also provide such services but in my experience they are not as competitive on fees

i 'm having a difficult time understanding how chevron is avoiding taxes through party related loans from my understanding chevron is providing loans to its australian subsidiary at interest rates higher than market benchmarks does this shift profits from australia to the u.s. and how does it help chevron avoid taxes even though the corporate tax rate is higher in the u.s. than in australia they want to be taxed at the the lower tax rate in australia than in the u.s. the more description the better thanks edit i think i understand that chevron is giving out large loans with high interest rates to its subsidiary in australia and i think the australian subsidiary is converting its revenues to pay back the loan thus looking like profit in the corporation 's books in delaware how is the money to pay back interest being raised if not from revenue and how is that revenue not being taxed

in simple terms equity loan is money borrowed from the bank to buy assets which can be houses shares etc protected equity loan is commonly used in shares where you have a portfolio of shares and you set the minimum value the portfolio can fall to anything less than there may result in a sell off of the share to protect you from further capital losses   this is a very brief which does not fully cover what equity loan protected equity loan really mean

i believe the only thing you have n't mentioned to him is the possibility that his activity is criminally fraudulent i would sit him down and say something substantially similar to the following we 've talked about your investment before and i know you believe it 's fine   i just want to make sure you understand that this is very likely fraudulent activity   i know you believe in it but you 've said you do n't understand how or why it works   the problem with that is that if it is a fraud you ca n't protect yourself from criminal prosecution because you did n't understand what you were doing   the prosecutor will ask you if you asked others to give you or the organization money and then they will you based on trying to defraud others it does n't matter whether you did it on purpose or just because you believed the people you are investing in so i very strongly advise you to understand exactly what the system is and how it works and then make sure with a lawyer that it 's legal   if it is then hey you 've learned something valuable   but if it 's not then you will save yourself a whole lot of trouble and anguish down the road if you step away before someone you attract to the investment decides to talk to their accountant or lawyer   a civil lawsuit may be bad but if you 're criminally prosecuted it will be so much worse now that i 've said my piece i wo n't talk to you about it anymore or bother you about it i wish you luck and hope that things work out fine i would n't talk to the police or suggest that i 'd do anything of that nature without proof then there 's no real way to start an investigation anyway and unfortunately scams like this are incredibly hard to investigate so the police often spend little to no time on them without a high level insider giving up evidence and associates chances are good nothing would happen to your friend one day the organization will disappear and he wo n't recover any more money but there 's a distinct possibility that when that happens the people below him will come for him and he wo n't be able to look further up the chain for help perhaps the threat of illegal activity will be enough to prevent him from defrauding others but if not i think at least you can let it go and know that you 've done everything for him that might work

actually banks are n't required to and do n't report on because they already report $ cash transactions to fincen as a currency transaction report ctr which is similar see the first item under exceptions in the second column of page 3 of the actual form yes is for businesses that 's why the form title is received in a trade or business   you did not receive the money as part of a trade or business and it 's not taxable income to you so you are n't required to report receiving it your are unclear but assuming you have n't deposited yet when you do the bank will confirm your identity and file their ctr it is extremely unlikely the government will investigate you for a single transaction close to $ 10k they 're after whales and killer sharks not but if they do when they do you simply explain where the money came from the irs abuses were with respect to people mostly small businesses that made numerous cash deposits slightly under $ 10k which can be but in the abuse cases actually was not an attempt to avoid reporting which is called structuring as long as you cooperate with the bank 's required reporting and do n't avoid it you are fine

brokers need to assess your level of competency to ensure that they do n't allow you to bite off more than you can chew and find yourself in a bad situation some brokers ask you to rate your skills others ask you how long you 've been trading it always varies based on broker i use ib and they gave me a about a wide range of instruments my skill level time spent trading trades per year etc   many brokers will use your self reported experience to choose what types of instruments you can trade some will only allow you to start with stocks and restrict access to forex options futures etc until you ask for and for some brokers even pass a test of knowledge options are very commonly restricted so that you can only go long on an option when you own the underlying stock when you are a newbie and scale out from there many brokers adopt a four tiered approach for options where only the most skilled traders can write naked options as seen here it 's important to note that all of this information is self reported and you are not legally bound to answer honestly in any way if for example you are well aware of the risks of writing naked options and want to try it despite never trading one before there is nothing stopping you from saying you 've traded options for 10 years and be given the privilege by your broker of course they 're just looking out for your best interest but you are by no means forced into the scheme if you do not wish to be

i like the way you framed this question   there is no single right answer for what to do with your savings but there are some choices that are wrong in the sense that they are dominated by other choices you could make   of the choices you listed there are two that fall into that category   the ones that seem like a bad idea to me are putting it into your roth 401(k   you ca n't do this directly anyhow but you could do it indirectly by increasing your contributions and using the growth fund to cover the hole in your budget but that 's a lot of work for a relatively small gain   you would essentially be exchanging one long term investment for another long term investment   you would pay capital gains taxes on the investment when you sell it today in order to not pay taxes on its earnings when you eventually withdraw it   there is some benefit there but it 's a long way off not that large and probably not worth the effort   things that might change your mind   if your 401(k was a traditional 401(k paying tax at capital gains rate today to get a deduction at your normal income rate is likely to be a win   you 're not contributing enough to get the full company match always try to get that match if you can putting it into your emergency fund   once again you are likely to pay capital gains tax if you do this and you will be putting it into an investment that is likely to get a lower return than your current one   it is n't really necessary to incur these costs since if you encounter an emergency that you ca n't cover with your existing emergency fund you could always liquidate the growth fund then when you know you need it   now a growth fund is going to be more volatile than what you would normally want for an emergency fund but the risk is n't that bad if you think about it   say your emergency comes up and you find that the growth fund is down 20 which would be a pretty horrible run   that 's $ 600 less that you have to deal with the situation   keep in mind that you already have $ 2000 and building in your current emergency fund   is that $ 600 going to make the difference between meeting the need and not   it 's not likely   better to leave the investment where it is and keep building your emergency fund week by week   things that might change your mind your level of risk aversion if having that money in a more risky investment is keeping you up at night move it   you face significant job uncertainty if you have reason to think your job is at risk it might be a good idea to top off that emergency fund sooner rather than later your other two choices both seem like solid options under the right circumstances   if it were me i 'd leave the investment in place rather than use it to pay off the student loan   the investment is likely though of course not guaranteed to earn more than the interest rate even on the highest rate loan especially when you consider that the interest on the student loan is probably tax deductible   moreover the size of the investment is n't enough to fully repay the loan so putting it toward the loan wo n't even improve your cash flow for some time to come   however there is always a chance that the investment will perform poorly and some people prefer the guaranteed return from paying off the loan   it depends on your personal risk tolerance   the one thing i would recommend is to think of putting the money toward the loan not as a debt repayment but as a fixed income investment with a yield equal to your loan 's interest rate   if you would still consider buying it then then go ahead   if not then stick with what you 've got   in my experience people get way too emotional about debt try to take that emotion out of your decision making if you can

while it is true that this formula may have historically outperformed the market you have to keep one important thing in mind once the formula is out in the open the market inefficiency will disappear here is what i mean historically there have always been various inefficiencies in the market structure some people were able to find these and make good money off them invariably these people tend to write books about how they did it what happens next is that lots of people get in on the game and now you have lots of buyers going after positions that used to be under priced raising demand and thus prices for these positions this is how inter exchange arbitrage disappeared its how high frequency trading is running itself into the ground if enough demand is generated for an inefficiency the said inefficiency disappears or the gains get so small that you can only make money off it with large amounts of capital keep in mind as graham said there is no silver bullet in the stock market since you do not hold any data that is unavailable to everyone else

facebook is an online social networking service which i 'd categorize as an ad supported social media platform for a type of company facebook makes money from advertisers and applications on the site so there are a couple of different income streams though in recent years facebook has done a number of acquisitions that should be noted as the company is much more than just the fb site in terms of b2c or b2b i see facebook as being a b2c where businesses are paying for access to consumers rather than businesses looking for other businesses some of the posts on facebook can be sponsored posts that are where things can be a bit for what is an advertisement at the same time various games run through facebook may also make facebook some money since some games may use in game purchases that are worth noting b2b requires one to have 3 companies in the overall system one that is the middle one that is providing a service and one that is consuming a service while facebook is selling advertising on this site i do n't see this as that different from tv networks and other distribution channels that ads are bought for consumers to use there is something to be said for what audience is one aiming b2b implies corporate customers which i doubt is what facebook 's customers want rather they are personal consumers that are n't companies on their own to my mind if you want something closer to b2b consider amazon.com 's cloud services where companies may buy resources from amazon as part of the systems they may use to interface with others i can remember in a previous job that we used clay tablet for doing translation services that took content from my employer 's servers to amazon 's cloud that would then be taken by the translation company for more than a few different pieces to the puzzle while part of facebook could be seen as b2b i doubt i 'd see them as a large part of it but i could be wrong as b2b b2c distinctions are n't my specialty are they yours consider paypal in contrast where a business may use paypal for payment processing paypal has agreements that enable them to process payments either through individual bank accounts or merchant accounts as well as for the company that wants to use paypal for their e commerce site thus there can be businesses on each side which is where i see this being a b2b company that is also b2c as some people may just be consumers consider google as another contrast where companies may pay to use google for e mail and the office like products like google docs and google drive that i 'm not sure is b2b as this is just a business buying services from google that does n't involve another company while there is b2c b2b and b2 g not every business has to tie into a specific category here for something else to consider

first of all there are some differences between the retirement accounts that you mentioned regarding taxes   traditional ira and 401(k accounts allow you to make pre tax contributions giving you an immediate tax deduction when you contribute   roth ira roth 401(k are funded with after tax money and a non retirement account is of course also funded with after tax money   so if you are looking for the immediate tax deduction this is a point in favor of the retirement accounts roth ira roth 401(k accounts allow the investment to grow tax free which means that the growth is not taxed even when taking the investment out at retirement   with traditional ira and 401(k accounts you need to pay tax on the gains realized in the account when you withdraw the money just as you do with a non retirement account   this is a point in favor of the roth retirement accounts to answer your question about capital gains yes it is true that you do not have a capital gain until an investment is sold   so discounting the contribution tax deductions of the retirement accounts if you only bought individual stocks that never paid a dividend and never sold them until retirement you are correct that it really would n't matter if you had it in a regular brokerage account or in a traditional ira   however even people dedicated to buy and hold rarely actually buy only individual stocks and hold them for 30 years there are several different circumstances that will generally happen in the time between now and when you want to withdraw the money in retirement that would be taxable events if you are not in a retirement account if you sell an investment and buy a different one the gains would be taxable if you want to rebalance your holdings this also involves selling a portion of your investments   for example if you want to maintain an 80 bond ratio and your stock values have gone up to 90 you might want to sell some stock and buy bonds   or if you are getting closer to retirement you might decide to go with a higher percentage of bonds   this would trigger capital gains inside a mutual fund anytime the management sells investments inside the fund and realizes capital gains these gains are passed on to the investors and are taxable   this happens more often with managed funds than index funds but still happens occasionally with index funds dividends earned by the investments are taxable   any of these events in a non retirement account would trigger taxes that need to be paid immediately even if you do n't withdraw a cent from your account

the answer is that the trader is hoping to profit from a potential rise in implied volatility he is isolating his exposure to iv only and mitigating his risk to the directional move of the underlying by hedging with the underlying basically his delta is neutral his gamma is positive and a potential source of profit and his theta is negative which is a potential source of loss he hopes that the profits from long gamma will overcome the loss from the short theta he achieves this by actively gamma scalping to remain delta neutral over the life of the option

private companies can serve the campaign donation needs of congress the usps ca n't   that 's the driving force behind privatization in the us raising campaign funds is the one thing congress is good at government agencies are n't allowed to make political donations but they can be replaced with private companies that can replace well paid workers who might donate to democrats with corporate executives who donate to republicans and minimum wage workers who ca n't afford to donate to anyone taxpayers get to pay even more because competition only lowers prices in profitable markets while government provides unprofitable but necessary services   for example the usps is required to provide universal service which is costly but contributes to a better society and a more robust economy fedex and ups do n't want to service rural locations cities and suburbs are more profitable

one reason for this is that many people do n't simply allow their houses to rot and decay if you 're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and for 35 years it probably will be in pretty poor shape   but a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition so they invest in things like new roofs siding gutters windows paint new furnaces hot water heaters air conditioners etc all this stuff costs money and for tax purposes can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold but it maintains the value of the property a small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix but if left it could eventually cause much of the building to rot making the structure near worthless if a car into your living room you do n't generally leave it there most people repair the damage   it 's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses or 300 + year old houses in some countries that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim   people also renovate their homes ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions decks etc this also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value

a home is an investment but the value it returns is n't primarily financial $ $ they are consumption a place to live this gives it different characteristics than other investments e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home does n't do much to assist your financial well being and future income and is n't necessarily the responsible thing to do you may get some capital gains typically in line with inflation sometimes less sometimes more but those are n't the most reliable and it 's difficult to realize them it involves selling your house and moving its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent but if you 're still working full time and can expect cost of living increases that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to say someone living on a fixed income but as for treating it as a low risk investment that 's very problematic real low risk investments are things like government bonds where you ca n't lose principal unless you 're going to live into your house until the day you die the real estate crash should have you of any notion that housing values never go down rather your house is a single illiquid investment imagine if you will going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties also you ca n't sell any of it until you move away and the transaction fee will take something like 3 still sound safe moreover it 's exactly the wrong kind of risk your house 's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy this means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time it totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations safety is not the way you should be thinking of it though

look as my final comment   you 're overthinking this   companies routinely have more cash on their books than they need because they keep a rainy day fund   yes there are extreme examples like apple that has about 60 billion more than they need but practically all companies are going to maintain excess cash for emergencies acquisitions etc   as i said in another comment the common theme between a dcf and an ev multiple is that they are both capital structure independent     even here there are going to be differences companies with a really shitty capital structure read too much debt will trade publicly at a lower enterprise value multiple because of the risk that they go bankrupt   in an acquisition this probably would not be the case   in the case of a dcf you would probably raise your discount rate to account for the risk of bankruptcy

i wrote a spreadsheet < < it may not be obvious this is a link to pull down the spreadsheet a while back that might help you you can start by putting your current salary next to your age adjust the percent of income saved 14 for you and put in the current total   the sheet basically shows that if one saves 15 from day one of working and averages an 8 return they are on track to save over 20x their final income and at the 4 withdrawal rate will replace 80 of their income remember if they save 15 and at retirement the 7.65 fica goes away so it 's 100 of what they had anyway for what it 's worth a 10 average return drops what you need to save down to 9 i say to a young person try to start at 15 better that when you 're 40 you realize you 're well ahead of schedule and can relax a bit than to assume that 8 9 is enough to save and find you need a large increase to catch up   to answer specifically here there are those who concluded that 4 is a safe withdrawal rate so by targeting 20x your final income as retirement savings you 'll be able to retire well   retirement spending needs are not the same for everyone when i cite an 80 replacement rate it 's a guess a rule of thumb that many point out is flawed the real number is your true spending need which of course can be far higher or lower the younger investor is going to have a far tougher time guessing this number than someone a decade away from retiring the 80 is just a target to get started it should shift to the real number in your 40s or 50s as that number becomes clear   next i see my original answer did n't address social security benefits the benefit is n't linear a lower wage earner can see a benefit of as much as 50 of what they earned each year while a very high earner would see far less as the benefit has a maximum a $ 90k earner will see 30 or less the social security site does a great job of giving you your projected benefit and you can adjust target savings accordingly   2016 update the prior 20 years returned cagr considering there were 2 crashes one of which was called a mini depression is pretty remarkable for what it 's worth my adult investing life started in 1984 and i 've seen a cagr of for forecasting purposes i think 8 long term is a conservative number   to answer member comment the 10 years from 2006 2015 had a cagr of time has a way of averaging that lost decade the 00 's to a more reasonable number

the strategy could conceivably work if you had sufficient quantity of shares to fill all of the outstanding buy orders and fill your lower buy orders   but in this case you are forcing the market down by selling and reinforcing the notion that there is a sell off by filling ever lower buy orders   there is the potential to trigger some stop loss orders if you can pressure it low enough   there is a lot of risk here that someone sees what you are doing and decides to jump in and buy forcing the price back up   could this work sure   but it is very risky and if you fail to create the panic selling then you risk losing big   i also suspect that this would violate sec rules and several laws   and if the price drops too far then trading on the stock would be halted and is likely to return at the appropriate price bottom line i can not see a scenario where you do not trigger the stop net a profit and end up with as many or more stock that you had in the first place

this question has the united kingdom tag so the information about usa or other law and procedures is probably only of tangential use except for understanding that no this is not something to ignore it may well indicate someone trying to use your i d fraudulently or some other sort of data processing foul up that may adversely impact your credit rating the first thing i would do is phone the credit card company that sent the letter to inform them that i did not make his application and ask firmly but politely to speak to their fraud team i would hope that they would be helpful it 's in their interests as well as yours added later by the way do not trust anything written on the letter it may be a fake letter trying to lure or panic you into some other sort of scam such as closing your compromised bank account and transferring the money in it to the fraud team for safety yes it sounds stupid but con men are experts at what they do and even finance industry professionals have fallen victim to such scams so find a telephone number for that credit card company independently for example google and then call that number if it 's the wrong department they 'll be able to transfer you internally if the card company is unhelpful you have certain legal rights that do not cost much if anything this credit company is obliged to tell you as an absolute minimum which credit reference agencies they used when deciding to decline your application yes you did not make it but it was in your name and affected your credit rating there are three main credit rating agencies and whether or not the bank used them i would spend the statutory £ 2 fee if necessary with each of them to obtain your statutory credit report which basically is all data that they hold about you they are obliged to correct anything which is inaccurate and you have an absolute right to attach a note to your file explaining for example that you entries x y and z were fraudulently caused by an unknown third party trying to steal your id they may be factually correct e.g. credit search on so it 's possible that you can not have them removed and it may not be in your interests to have them removed but you certainly want them flagged as unauthorized   if you think the fraudster may be known to you you can also use the data protection act on the company which write to you requiring them to send you a copy of all data allegedly concerning yourself which it holds this costs £ 10 in particular you will require sight of the application and signature if it was made on paper and the ip address details if it was made electronically as well as all the data content and subsequent communications you may recognise the but even if not you then have documentary evidence that it is not yours as for the ip address you can deduce the internet service provider and then use the data protection act on them they may decline to give any details if the fraudster used his own credentials in which case again you have documentary evidence that it was not you and something to give the police and bank fraud investigators if they get interested i suspect they wo n't be very interested if all you uncover is   fraudulent applications that were declined however you may uncover a successful fraud i.e. a live card in your name being used by a criminal or a store or phone credit agreement in which case obviously get in touch with that company to get it shut down and to get the authorities involved in dealing with the crime in general write down everything you are told including phone contact names and keep it confirm anything that you have agreed in writing and keep copies of the letters you write and of course the replies you receive you should n't need any lawyer the uk credit law puts the onus very much on the credit card company to prove that you owe it money and if a random stranger has stolen your i d it wo n't be able to do that in fact it 's most unlikely that it will even try unless you have a criminal record or a record of financial delinquency but it may be an awful lot of for years to come if somebody has successfully stolen your id so even if the first lot of credit reference agency print outs look clean check again in about six weeks time and yet again   in maybe 3 months finally there is a scheme that you can join if you have been a victim of id theft i 've forgotten its name but you will probably be told about it your credit reference files will be tagged at your request with a requirement for extra precautions to be taken this should not affect your credit rating but might make obtaining credit more hassle for example requests for additional id before your account is opened after the approval process oh and post a letter to yourself it 's not unknown for fraudsters to persuade the post office to redirect all your mail to their address

quite a lot changed since back then so i consider it highly unlikely that you could point to one single cause you can think about it more clearly when you remove money from the equation know that money is only an intermediary in the exchange of goods and it is in fact the exchanged goods that matter so to your question you produce some goods and exchange them for the goods you consume the amount of goods that you can exchange what you produced for determines your quality of life so what parts could change   1 you could actually produce less the increase in productivity is really hard to accurately measure because even if you know for a fact that one worker 's increased when buying a machine maybe that comes at a cost of less productivity in other areas   2 not everything that you pay for does actually increase your quality of life for example speeding tickets do n't other stuff might increase your quality of life but in a manner that you do n't easily recognize for example more prisoners that you pay for might reduce your chance of being mugged however if you 're not being mugged on a regular basis you would n't notice   3 other people get a higher percentage most countries tax rates rise with rising income so when the currency is being devalued tax rates rise relative to your purchasing power in addition to other taxes and fees that might be introduced or increased but even without government your bosses might simply take a bigger cut of the company 's earnings   4 we might produce the wrong stuff if more stuff gets produced that you do not want the production of the stuff you do want will decline even if total productivity is increased   and that is only what i can think of from the top of my head you will probably find that all of those happen and most likely other causes as well

now a days your stocks can be seen virtually through a brokerage account back in the days a stock certificate was the only way to authenticate stock ownership you can still request them though from the corporation you have shares in or your brokerage it will have your name corporation name and number of shares you have you have to buy shares of a stock either through a brokerage or the corporation itself most stock brokerages are legit and are fdic or sipc insured but your risks are your own loses the $ 10 you are referring to is the trade commission fee the brokerage charges when you place an order to buy or sell a stock the brokerage will charge you $ 10 so for example if you bought 1 share of a $ 20 stock the total transaction cost will be $ 30 depending on the state you live in you can basically starting trading stocks at either 18 or 21 you can donate gift your shares to virtually anyone when you sell a stock and experience a profit you will be charged a capital gains tax if you buy a stock and sell it for a gain within 1 year you will taxed up to 35 or your tax bracket but if you hold it for more than a year you will taxed only 15 or your tax bracket

some countries like the united states allow a mortgage interest tax deduction   this means the interest you pay on a mortgage which is typically much more than half of the monthly payment at the beginning of a 25 year mortgage is tax deductible so you might get 33 or more of the interest back and that effectively makes the interest rate significantly lower   therefore you are borrowing the money really cheap   that makes mrchrister 's answer even more appropriate

assuming that blocks dark liquidity and auctions are n't available one of the biggest things that equity traders also have going for them is the availability of different execution venues as well as the aforementioned ability to strategically time execution child order placement based on the state of the order book at any given time   a security with a nyse primary listing bac or ibm for example will be traded on several exchanges ecns nasdaq nyse arca the various bats exchanges and that in itself opens up a lot of opportunity to spread out an order   as an alternative to simply going through several price levels on a single exchange you can also route out multiple orders simultaneously to different exchanges to scoop up liquidity   all of that being said i think it should be noted that you really ca n't exclude the execution methods that you mentioned in your original question   any large institutional investor looking to trade in size will only get so far with trading on lit venues especially in the us equity marketplace   taking advantage of block liquidity or floating part or all of an order in a dark pool is a good way to mask intentions and minimize market impact   if you 're part of a beta index tracking strategy you actually need to leverage auctions index rebalances like the msci russell s&amp;p all have a ton of participants executing market on close orders to account for adds     overall the buy side is becoming increasingly sophisticated when it comes to advanced execution and it has been interesting to see how fintech companies brokers and exchanges have been feeding into the innovation

is evaluating stocks just a loss of time if the stock is traded very much not at all making sound investment decisions based on fundamental analysis of companies will help you to do decide whether a given company is right for you and your risk appetite investing is not a zero sum game and you can achieve a positive long term or short term depending on what you 're after outcome for yourself without compromising your ability to sleep at night if you take the time to become acquainted with the companies that you are investing in how can you ensure that your evaluation is more precise than the    market ones which consists of the evaluation of thousands of people    and professionals for the average individual the answer is often simply you probably can not but you do n't have to set the bar that high what you can do is ensure that your evaluation gives you a better understanding of your investment and allows you to better align it with your investment objectives you do n't have to beat the professionals you just have to lose less money than you would by paying them to make the decision for you

chip and pin cards are popular in europe however in the us we do n't have them   visa mc and amex can issue chip and pin cards but no merchants or machines are set up here to take them   only certain countries in europe use them and since you could possibly have a us visitor or a non chip and pin person using your machine or eating at your restaurant they usually allow you to sign or just omit the pin if the card does n't have a chip it is definitely less secure but the entire credit card industry in the us is running right now without it so i do n't think the major credit card companies care too much they just pass the fraud on to the merchants anyway

note this answer is true for the uk other places may vary there are a couple of uses for credit cards   the first is to use them in a revolving manner if you pay off the bill in full every time you get one then with the vast majority of cards you will pay no interest delay your expenses by a month build your credit rating and with many credit cards you can also get rewards generally you should wait until the bill comes to pay it off this ensures that your usage is reported to the credit ratings agencies in general you should not draw out cash on credit cards as there is usually a fee and unlike purchases it will start interest immediately the second is longer term borrowing this is where you have to be careful firstly the standard rate on most credit cards is 20 apr which is pretty high secondly on many cards once you are carrying a balance any purchases start interest immediately however many credit cards offer promotional rates in contrast to the standard rates which are an expensive way to borrow the promotional rates often allow you to borrow at 0 apr for some period usually when it comes to promotional rates you get the best deal by opening a new credit card and using it immediately   ideally you should plan to pay off the card before the 0 period ends if you ca n't do that then a balance transfer may be an option but be aware than in a few years the market for credit cards may or may not have changed whatever you do you should always make sure to pay at least the minimum payment and do so on time not doing so may trigger steep fees loss of promotional interest rates there is a site called that tracks the best deals

congratulations for achieving an important step in the road to financial freedom some view extending loan payment of loans that allow the deduction of interest as a good thing some view the hit on the credit score by prematurely paying off an installment loan as a bad thing   determining the order of paying off multiple loans in conjunction with the reality of income required monthly living expense and the need to save for emergencies is highly   keeping an artificial debt seems to make little sense it is an expensive insurance policy to chase a diminishing tax benefit and boost to a credit score keep in mind it is a deduction not a credit so how much you save depends on your tax bracket   it might make sense for somebody to extend the loan out for an extra year or two but you ca n't just assume that that advice applies in your situation personally i paid off my student loan early as soon as it made sense based on my income and my situation i am glad i did but for others the opposite made more sense

actually most insurance policies don't have a cash value if you do n't make a claim   the reason that some life insurance policies do this is that they are really tax sheltered investments posing as insurance   with that in mind the root of your question is really whether insurance premiums are wasted if you never make a claim it really makes no difference if you are talking about ei auto or homeowner 's insurance my answer to that is no what you are paying for when you buy insurance is financial risk avoidance look at it this way you do n't buy ei as an investment where you hope to get a return on your investment you are buying the right to be protected against catastrophic financial difficulty associated with losing your job whether you claim it or not you did receive that protection this is what drives me so crazy when i hear people talk about how an insurance company is ripping you off because you paid more in premiums than they paid out in benefits of course you did if most people did n't pay in more than the company paid out there would be no financial interest for someone to form an insurance company

for an investment to appreciate in value one of two things needs to happen 1 demand for that particular item needs to increase 2 the supply of that item needs to decrease houses are good because everyone needs a place to live but there is a finite amount of land   no matter how much you invest in real estate ai n't   the trick there is to find an area that people are going to want to live in when you 're ready to sell   specific of wines and spirits are another good example because it 's literally impossible to create more of that vintage cars and most consumer goods usually do n't appreciate because they do n't last long enough   most cars are resold within three to five years after the initial purchase   this is also why jewelry is a good investment properly cared for it can last centuries without wearing out so look for something durable that has a limited supply

one thing recessions do is sort out market inefficiencies   often that means re directing people who are in jobs they ca n't   do properly into other career fields     during the dot com boom tons of people with liberal arts degrees and no experience wound up as software engineers   not all of them sucked but many did and the dot com crash sorted that out   as an engineer i saw this first hand and it was n't a bad thing i had a lot of co workers in 2000 who were n't pulling their weight   this is going to sound heartless and maybe it is but if someone has been unemployed 3 years maybe it is time for a career change     your tax credit idea is only going to penalize businesses for operating efficiently penalize the productively and cost the government in revenue   also tax incentives rarely have the impact they 're designed to have and there are always consequences   large businesses exploit them small get abused by them   if we want to see job growth tax codes need to get simpler not more complex

generally in international transfers there are 4 banks involved customer 's bank customer who initiating the payment also called sender bank there is sender 's correspondent bank then there is beneficiary bank also called receiver bank bank where beneficiary holds account there is receiver 's correspondent bank so person a- > a 's bank > a 's correspondent bank > b 's correspondent bank > b 's bank > person b. depending on the currency at times there is only one correspondent bank the chain of correspondent bank is common knowledge and quite often if you do n't provide all the details your bank or other bank will fill in default details and processes the payments however it all depends on which bank and whether they are inclined to do so some bank specifically insist to use a preferred correspondent bank so if you do n't specify any they may return reject it

credit cards are often more fool proof against over drawing consider bill has solid cash flow but most of their money is in his high interest savings account earning interest an account that does n't have a card but is accessible via online banking bill keeps enough in the debit transactions account for regular spending much of which comes out automatically e.g. rent utilities some of which he spends as needed eg shopping lunch on top of the day to day money bill keeps an overhead amount so if something happens he does n't overdraw the account which would incur significant fees now bill sees that the giant tv he has been saving for is on sale half price and there is just one left it costs more than he would normally spend in a week much more but bill knows that his pay should have just gone in and his rent not yet come out plus the overhead he keep in the account so there is money in his debit account when he gets home he can open up online banking and transfer from his savings after all the tv is what he was saving for what bill forgets is that there was a public holiday last week in the state where payroll is operated and that his pay is going to go in a day late so now he might have over drawn the account buying the tv or maybe that was fine but paying the rent over draws the account now he has a overdraft fee probably on the order of $ 50 most banks at least where i am will happily allow you to overdraw you account giving you a loan at high interest and with an immediate overdraft fee they do this cos the fee is so high that they can tolerate the risk of the non assessed loan sometimes if you ask they do n't let you do it with your own eg buying the tv but they do let you do it on automated eg the rent on the other hand banks will not let you over draw a credit card they know exactly how much loan and risk they were going to take if bill had most of his transactions going on his credit card then it would have just bounced at the cash register and bill would have remembered what was going on and then transferred the money there are many ways you can accidentally overdraw your account particularly if it is a shared account

the short answer is with limited credit your best bet might be an fha loan for first time buyers   they only require 3.5 down if i recall the number right and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580 the problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines such as signing up for new credit cards etc they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit   first your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added while your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect assuming you 're making all of the payments on time a good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history and to make sure it 's a mix of account types such as store cards installment loans and credit cards to show that you can handle various types of credit be careful not to add too much credit because it affects your debt to income ratio and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing i really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what you 're trying to do   they also offer credit score which can help you understand how your score might change if for instance you add new credit cards pay off existing cards or take on installment loans   it 's well worth checking out i hope this helps   good luck

the indication is based on the average buy hold sell rating of a group of fundamental analysts the individual analysts provide a buy hold or sell recommendation based on where the current price of the stock is compared to the perceived value of the stock by the analyst   note that this perceived value is based on many assumptions by the analyst and their biased view of the stock that is why different fundamental analysts provide different values and different recommendations on the same stock so basically if the stock 's price is below the analyst 's perceived value it will be given a buy recommendation if the price is equal with the perceived value it will be given a hold recommendation and if the price is more than the perceived value it will be given a sell recommendation as the others have said this information imho is useless

i find those government checks arguments to be more appealing in theory than in reality    ultimately it comes down to deciding who gets what and who gets to be the    capitalism is far from perfect but it decides who gets what through the individual decentralized choices of everyone again it 's not perfect by any means but it is and everyone makes decisions for themselves not for other people    government action decides who gets what through a highly indirect process of electing politicians and decisions are made by a small group of people who are under practically speaking   very little oversight or control a few people make decisions for everyone else    government action is despite all our desire and efforts to avoid this necessarily subject to the same disparities in influence control as the market it may come in different forms and the consequences may manifest differently often less readily apparent but there is no avoiding the a few people have a lot more control than everyone else problem    governments are more prone to corruption because they trade the intangible currency of power in addition to money    no matter how you go about doing so it 's always easier to counteract a private actor than a government given roughly equivalent levels of influence obviously     i understand the desire for intervention but i think we have a scary tendency to place far too much weight on good intentions and far too little weight on consequences    it 's so easy to think things through in your head i do often and come up with a plan that could obviously work exactly as intended for everyone 's benefit in doing so we forget that people are n't to be guided through life for someone else 's vision or pursuit of utopia or anything else they have lives desires interests plans of their own and theirs are just as valid as yours or mine    the reality is that you and i are probably far more similar than either of us would guess but there are still huge differences what we value what we want to do next year whether we want that promotion or want to get laid off so we can finally start our dream business whether we want money for family vacations or medical bills so many differences that i could n't ever fairly and accurately represent your interests without you actually telling me what they are    that 's just the 2 of us there are 300 million people in the us we ca n't comprehend even really knowing a thousand well enough to genuinely speak on their behalf    in theory big plans make everything better in practice they run into the reality that humans truly are n't and controlling 300 million people and predicting their responses actions is way more difficult than it seems big plans often end up with real people people who are just as deserving of opportunities and rights as everyone else getting really hurt because some guy he does n't know and who does n't know him had an idea and the power to enforce it on everyone    i 'm not saying that all government interference is bad of course and i 'm not saying it should n't happen     government interventions that are straightforward wealth transfers are probably less harmful to people like a tax on the rich to give hefty tax refunds to the poor is more direct and less prone to causing unintentional harm then things like wage manipulations

see if they offer a target date plan that automatically adjusts throughout your career to balance gains against preserving what you 've already built up   you can adjust for more or less aggressive by selecting a plan with a later or sooner target date respectively but check the administrative fees higher fees can eat up a surprisingly large part of your growth since they 're essentially subtracted from rate of return and thus get compounded if they do n't have that option or charge too much for it then yes you may want to adjust which plan your money is in over time you can usually exchange between these plans at no cost and with no tax penalty note the tax advantaged 401(k investments should be considered in the context of all your investments this is one of the things an independent financial planner can help you with as with other investment decisions the best answer for you depends on your risk tolerance and your time horizon

a tfsa is a tax free savings account   it is a type of account where you can buy various investments like stocks bonds or funds mutual exchange traded and money market   there are some other options but it 's best to see what your bank or broker will allow you probably specified the type of investment when you opened the account   you can look at your statements or maybe online to see what you 're invested in   my guess is some kind of high interest savings account   this is kind of the default option for banks the government created these accounts for a variety of reasons   the main stated reason was to encourage people to save    obviously they also do things to get votes   there was an outcry after the change to a type of investment called investment trusts   this could be seen as a consolation prize   these can be valuable to seniors for many reasons and they tend to vote more often   there was also an election promise to eliminate capital gains taxes in some fashion it 's not profitable for the government in fact it supposedly cost the federal government $ 410 million in 2013   banks make money by investing your deposit or by charging fees you can see what every tax break costs the government in lost revenue here

well there are a few comments that need to be made here i suppose though at work now so this will be short    first there is the difference between banking which indeed mostly looks at capital adequacy ratios and uses var as one of the methods to get to the risk weighted assets then there is the buy side which is more interested in how much would i stand to lose in portfolio x if markets head south and how does that relate to what a have promised my client in the first situation it is the bank itself taking on the risk in the second the risk lies entirely with the client an asset manager could lose 100 on your regular old equity mandate and it would n't hit him except for loss in fees whereas a significant trading loss for a bank can put it out of business    my personal view is that all of these metrics are merely useful instruments and for a large part they all tell me the same thing a higher duration on a fixed income mandate will give a higher var a higher shortfall more negative results on rates stress scenarios etcetera they only really become useful when imposing limits on them or using them to steer based on whatever the prevailing risk appetite is at a certain point in time or when looking at trends or relative risk of portfolio a vs b   do n't get me wrong i too can debate for hours about var parameters confidence intervals look back periods return frequency decay factors parametric or historical monte carlo simulation etcetera but i think in practise that is really of limited use if you take any ex ante risk measure and you thoroughly understand it make an informed choice about risk appetite and steer on it you basically have done your job as a risk manager   sorry i know i am not answering your questions in a structured way but am on my phone so it 's hard to keep overview pm me if you want to discuss things in detail

i 'm going to start with your title question how can home buying be considered a sound investment with all of that interest that needs to be paid if taken literally this is a loaded question because if you pay cash for a home you do n't pay any interest furthermore if your interest rate is 3 for 10 years you wo n't pay nearly as much interest as you will if your rate is 10 for 30 years so all of that interest is relative to your personal situation having said that of course i understand what you mean most people pay interest and interest is expensive so how do you calculate if it 's worth it that question has been asked and answered but for your particular situation you really have two separate questions i believe you should answer these questions independently if you move far away it 's probably the case that you can save a lot of money by either renting or buying in that location so you should first consider if it 's worth it to move and then if it is decide if it 's worth it to rent or buy if you decide not to move far away then decide if maybe you can save money by renting somewhere near your current home since it sounds like if you move you may have to become a landlord living close by to your tenant may also make it easier to deal with problems when they arise

whether or not it is logical probably depends on individual circumstance   when you take on or maintain debt you are choosing to do two things the first is clear this is what you describe very well in your answer it is a straightforward analysis of interest rates the fixed cost of the debt can then be directly compared to expected return on investments that are made with the newly available cash flow if you can reasonably expect to beat your debt interest rate this is an argument to borrow and invest add to this equation an overwhelming upside such as a 401k match and the argument becomes very compelling the second cost listed is more speculative in nature but just as important when you acquire debt you are committing your future cash flow to payments this exposes you to the risk of too little financial margin in the future it also exposes you to the risk of any negatives that come with non payment of debt repossession foreclosure credit hit sleeping at night family tension worst case bankruptcy since the future tends to be difficult to predict this risk is not so easy to quantify clearly the amount and nature of the debt is a large factor here   this would seem to be highly personal with different individuals having unique financial or personal resources or income earning power   i will never say someone is illogical for choosing to repay their debts before investing in a 401k i can see why some would always choose to invest to the match

smaller markets can actually be more volatile so it 's not a good idea to lower graham 's criteria for them the only real adjustment possible is inflation adjustment $ 100 million in 1973 united states works out to $ 500 million today based on the difference in cpi inflation from 1973 this number will be different for other markets where the rate of inflation since 1973 has been different so the real question to ask is what is to $ 100 million in the united states in 1973 worth today in your market source

i am answering this in light of the op mentioning the desire to buy a house   a proper mortgage uses debt to income ratios typically 28/36 which means 28 of monthly gross can go toward principal interest tax insurance and the total debt can go as high as 36 including credit cards and car payment etc so if you earn $ for easy math the 8 gap between 28 and 36 is $ 400 if you have zero debt they do n't let you use it for the mortgage it 's just ignored so a low interest long term student loan should not be accelerated if you are planning to buy a house better put that money to the down payment but for credit cards the $ carries $ 8000 banks treat it as though the payment is 5 of debt owed so i 'd attack that debt with a   no eating out no movies beer etc pay it off as if your life depended on it and you 'll be happier in the long run

last week barack obama went to kansas to kick off a more populist phase in his 2012 re election bid this is a make or break moment for the middle class declared the us president who chose the same venue that roosevelt used in 1910 to call for a new progressive era i believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot   saying everyone should get a fair shot always makes political sense particularly at a time when us income inequality rivals that of mark ’s age but it might have been a stretch for mr obama to suggest the american middle class is facing a unique make or break moment in reality the labour force has been for most of the past generation in a trend that has sharply accelerated since 2000   america used to be exceptional it maintained lower unemployment than the europeans and a higher rate of jobs turnover enabling it to get away with more benefits a fair day ’s work for a fair day ’s pay was within the grasp of most that gave america a booming middle class that until recently was the most important engine of global demand   no longer today somewhat remarkably us is higher than in much of europe and the us consumer is mired in high personal debt as the jobs crisis so too does us political allegations of class warfare are a staple of washington debate in contrast to the 1960s dominated by protests for peace and civil rights today ’s battles are economic yet there are few signs that either policymakers or economists are closer to finding answers nothing mr obama has been able to accomplish since 2008 including off a second great depression and pushing through an overhaul of the healthcare system appears to have resolved that underlying structural challenge indeed the signs are that the problem is in the words of david a leading labour economist at harvard university the labour force is suffering from a growing missing middle   in short the middle skilled jobs that once formed the of the world ’s wealthiest middle class are disappearing they are being supplanted by relatively low skilled and low paid jobs that can not be replaced either by new technology or by offshoring such as home nursing and landscape gardening jobs are also being created for the highly skilled notably in science engineering and management for the remainder of the workforce including college graduates it is both increasingly hard to find a secure job and tougher for those who do find jobs to be paid in line with inflation most people know that median us income has declined sharply since the late 1990s fewer are aware that real incomes also fell sharply in the same period for those with degrees only those with qualifications particularly phds saw net gains for some spectacular   the jobs crisis has many worrying of which three are worth highlighting perhaps the most troublesome is the waning of the market people used to describe the us labour market as after the austrian economist who depicted the cycle of creative destruction jobs might be lost rapidly in a downturn but were swiftly to more productive sectors when economic growth that is not now the case

i think there are several issues here first there 's the contribution as littleadv said there is no excess contribution excess contribution is only if you exceed the contribution limit the contribution limit for traditional iras does not depend on how high your income goes or whether you have a 401(k it 's the deduction limit that may depend on those things not deducting it is perfectly legitimate and is completely different than an excess contribution which has a penalty second the withdrawal you are allowed to withdraw contributions made during a year plus any earnings from those contributions before the tax filing deadline for the taxes of that year which is april 15 of the following year or even up to october 15 of the following year and it will be treated as if the contribution never happened no penalties the earnings will be taxed as regular income as if you put it in a bank account that sounds like what you did so the withdrawal was not an early withdrawal and the 1099-r should reflect that what distribution code did they put third even if and it does not sound like the case but if it does n't qualify as a return of contributions before the tax due date as described above maybe you withdrew it after october 15 of the following year as littleadv mentioned your contribution was a non deductible contribution and when withdrawing it only the earnings portion which after such a short time should only be a very small part of the distribution would be subject to tax and penalty

sure its possible its exactly what activist investors do with institutional money e.g. pension funds family foundations   probably implies an average donation per contributor in your mind however so you 'd need a lot of contributors as opposed to an institution writing a $ 1b check out of the box   as a benchmark you can start even without owning shares but it probably lends credibility to have a few percentage points   as of today gs 's market cap is $ jpm 's market cap is $ 's market cap is $ so you 'd need at least $ 1b of capital to buy a percentage point or two   at $ 100 per ticket that 's 10 m individual donors

so basically the bar has been lowered due to the fact that so many people do n't qualify for credit the medical debt issue is one thing but the fact that only 28 of home purchases these days are first time home buyers instead of 40 says more about our unaffordable higher educational system labor market and people 's ability to earn decent income than it does about credit being too tight   if anything this is a of standards since the banks have no alternative in order to drum up new sales they 're 12 off the mark and they 're finding ways to close the gap wages probably wo n't get better so they 're better off accepting lower quality customers and rolling the dice on their ability to pay off debts over the life of the loans they issue   sounding familiar

in the prior pmi discussions here it 's been stated that the bank is not obligated to remove pmi until the mortgage 's natural amortization puts the debt at 78 ltv so paying in advance like this will not automatically remove the pmi   nor will a lump sum payment be certain to move the next payment ahead a year if it 's entered as a principal prepayment the next month 's payment is still due in the world of coupon books if you sent in a year 's payments you 'd not benefit from the interest saved in one year you 'd owe what the amortization table tells you   there 's no free lunch when it comes to mortgages or finance in general this is why we usually caution that one should not be cash poor the day after buying a house best to save 30 put down 20 and have a cushion after the closing

i am using the same logic as the two answers above i got almost the same result $ instead of $ per share using the sold fractional share basis however the jci qualified dividend on the 1099-div not the 1099-b divided by the number of shares spun off yields a basis per share of only $ that compares to $ in answer two above it seems that we should get the approximately same basis per share using the same arithmetic and i do not know why we do n't for my tax files i plan to use the basis equal to the dividend from the 2016 1099-div of jci the plc after the merger my reasoning is that i can not use an amount for the basis that is greater than the dividend i paid taxes on in case this part of the question comes up again you can get historical quotes at various websites such as which does show $ as the closing price on

companies usually have a minimum account balance required to keep a 401k for former employees you will have to check whether $ 10k is sufficient to keep your funds in your former employer 's 401k if you are below their threshold you will have to move your money one option is to rollover into the new employer 's 401k   you can rollover a 401k into a traditional ira account that is independent of your employer a traditional ira has the same tax benefits as a 401k it grows tax free until you withdraw money from the account companies that offer iras include vanguard fidelity tiaa   many companies have significant overhead costs in the their 401k management it may be better for you to rollover your money into an ira to save on these costs   i am not knowledgeable about loaning from retirement accounts so i can not help with that

gt;first off the sec is under funded anyhow   and insane homeless persons do n't have a lot of operating capital but that does n't change the fact that they would not make good use of more capital if they had it the sec is a joke a completely captured entity    gt;i disagree first off the sec is under funded anyhow and most economists agree that there needs to be better regulation of the exchanges ya know since it can fucking crash our economy and send us into   they only have this power because the government gave it to them if the government took away the we 'd see the financial services industry wither back to a reasonable size    it 's a flat transaction tax much like any other state sales tax state sales tax is arguably the most successful form of taxation there is b c it 's so damn easy to implement and so damn easy to audit   of course whether or not the states have any right to this sort of taxation in the first place    gt;you're blowing this thing way out of proportion they require the markets to charge a transaction tax and then they do periodic audits to ensure each exchange is doing it   enron had periodic audits also and it did n't mean a fucking thing so did lehman brothers and all the other crap piles   gt;if you think that letting a market die and having new ones pop up periodically is a good idea then holy shit    if you think that letting a person die while new ones are born is a good idea then holy shit    we evolve and improve through death and replacement use of force to avoid a natural death leads to massive distortions in our mutual reality    markets need stability amp regulation finance does n't like uncertainty   markets need stability stability is created by flexibility in response to changing conditions regulations reduce flexibility which creates instability finance does n't like uncertainty and boy i do n't like it when it rains and i forgot my jacket but you can not control the universe you have to respect that the world is not at your command and if you ca n't live with that adapt to it and work anyway you just need to die and let someone more capable take your place    basically if physics worked like you think we 'd never have made it past the big bang because reality would be too concerned with the resulting instability and uncertainty

it 's really all just speculation we do n't know what they 're looking for     i do know from a roads perspective boston in general can be difficult because trucks ca n't get in there easily from every direction   western and newer builds that did n't grow up around colonial times seem preferred when i 've spoken to logistics people     they 'll also want a city capable of trial platforms so or ny could be huge   atlanta and austin as well   boston seems to mostly have a surrounding metro population yes but it 's also one of the furthest way from seattle which is n't an advantage so much as a proximity thing
