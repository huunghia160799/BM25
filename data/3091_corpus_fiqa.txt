the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

the expression in debt when talking about a person 's financial affairs means that the sum of debit balances on all accounts exceeds the sum of credit balances on all accounts     a mortgage account is not excluded from that this definition also does not consider whether any of the debt is secured or ownership of assets shares property etc    so someone with a mortgage of one million dollars for a home that is worth two million is in debt by one million dollars until they they sell the home for that amount and pay down the mortgage that means in debt is not necessarily a statement about net worth

i think you 're thinking that in debt does n't just mean owes a debt but somehow means owes more debt in total than the assets that condition owing money without offsetting assets is having a negative net worth if you have a mortgage then you have a debt and you are in debt you may have a positive net worth if you have equity in the house and your car and such like and have cash in the bank you may have a negative net worth if you owe more than you own but either way you are technically in debt knowing that it 's not surprising that 75 of americans are in debt it 's surprising that 25 are not they have no credit card no car loan no mortgage no line of credit no student loans is it because they 've paid all that off or because they are deadly poor and own nothing and ca n't be lent anything you ca n't just say it 's bad to have debt it 's bad to have too much debt to have a negative net worth to be in the habit of borrowing to finance a lifestyle you ca n't actually afford and so on but it 's perfectly normal to have a debt or two that 's how our system mostly works

yes    a mortgage is a kind of debt   someone lends you money to buy your house and you owe them the money so you have debt
# 534099
if you owe money to someone else then you are in debt at least in the common meaning of the word   what you happen to own or what you spent that money on does n't alter that fact are people considered in debt if their only debt is the mortgage loan for their house or are these people excluded from the statistic the only way to answer that for sure is to look at who compiled the statistic and exactly what methodology they used

mortgage is a secured debt a combination of a promissory note and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property yes you are in debt but that depends upon whether you define the term in debt as a debt appearing on the balance sheet or the net of assets liabilities is less than zero whether you have a debt expense on the income statement budget or whether the net of income expenses is less than zero one person might look at their budget find the monthly mortgage payment listed and judge that they have a debt payment and thus are in debt or they might look at their expenses find they exceed their income and judge that they are in debt another person might look at their balance sheet compare assets to liabilities and only say they were in debt when their liabilities exceeded their assets some people view mortgage debt as good debt as they view certain debts as good and others as bad trust me having a high mortgage payment higher 30 of your net income is hard and over 40 is bad consider you balance sheet and your income statement   on your balance sheet the house appears on the asset side with an estimated value while the mortgage really the promissory note part of the mortgage appears on the liability side on your income statement your house does not appear on the income side but the mortgage promissory note payment appears on the expense side so you clearly have both a liability with a clearly defined value and an expense with a clearly defined payment but do you have an asset according to an accountant you have an asset and a liability but you do not have a business asset that is producing revenue income nor do you have a business asset that can be amortized and expensed to reduce taxable income when we think about an asset does the word have the connotation of some thing with value something that produces income   well by that measure a house only provides income when we rent it out and only has value when we consider selling it as millions of families discovered during the housing price collapse when the market price of your asset falls substantially your personal financial status can fall negative and you can be broke
# 187739
yes a mortgage is debt   it 's unique in that you have a house which should be worth far more than the mortgage after the mortgage crisis many found their homes under water i.e. worth less than the mortgage   the word debt is a simple noun for money owed it carries no judgement or negative connotation except when it 's used to buy short lived items with money one does n't have   aside from my mortgage i get a monthly credit card bill which i pay in full that 's debt too only it carried no interest and rewards me with 2 cash back many people would avoid this as it 's still debt

well i 'm not an expert and you sound pretty credible however i still do n't see anything to back up what your saying in the sources that i 've found   gt active business income can still be earned by foreign subsidiaries if you can prove to revenue canada that it is a real corporation and taxed at better offshore rates if 90 or more of its income comes from third party transactions    this seems to be consistent with my definition   business profits earned by a foreign sub are taxed when profits are repatriated certain tax credits are available for foreign taxes paid and certain dividends out of surplus are tax free to the corporation not individuals      so when foreign sub pays dividends to the parent corp they are still charged repatriation just like in the us   again this sounds consistent with my previous comment canada has a corporate tax rate that is over 10 lower than the us so this is still a very good deal in its own right    maybe you can explain in more detail or provide a source that has some additional detail i also ca n't find any pieces on this or the deal that suggests beneficial repatriation rules

you 're missing the cost of carry aspect the cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity such as grain or metals over a period of time the carrying charge includes insurance storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs in interest rate futures markets it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument so in a nutshell you 'd have to store the gold safely invest your money now i.e. you 're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date   well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to london or wherever the agreed delivery place is edit forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices do n't diverge so the idea is n't that bad as i might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself i should that profits are small and is highly automated so before you spot a $ 1 profit somewhere between any two contracts you can be quite sure it 's been taken by an already

please refer to this question to understand the basics of how an order is matched how do exchanges match limit orders   now most of the times even block orders follow the same matching criteria i think you are assuming that for every large buy order there is a matching large sell order this is not true      so on the buy side at various point in times there were buy orders with single order more than 10,000 shares on the sell side to fulfil these orders there may or may not be a single order of 10,000 more often there will be quite a few smaller orders or 500 1000 or whatever amount that are present in the queue based on the amount time sort order or even partially matching out of a sell order of 10,000 similarly when there is a large sell order of more than 10,000 these may not have got filled in by a large buy order but by smaller buy orders etc    so if you average out the amounts on the buy side and the sell side there would definately be a difference the analysis of this difference is as indicated in your question buy price is more than sell price and hence people are bullish

boomers have also bid up the prices of a lot of things everything from stocks to housing simply because they as a bulge were all attempting to in the aggregate buy basically the same things at essentially the same time   basically a lot of demand chasing and driving a supply this often made the previously acquired assets i.e. the early boomer contingent who got there amp bought in first appear to increase quickly in price   the opposite effect will happen as they retire die off either they or their heirs will choose or need to sell off their various accumulated assets   then suddenly the supply will begin to bulge instead selling off portfolios of stocks even required as pensions need to be paid or as boomers reach + 70 1/2 and are mandated by law to begin selling off amp cashing in specific 's of their 401 k and ira holdings and likewise with housing aging boomers will downsize selling off the which they never really needed and which in retirement will be burdensome to maintain and trying to move into or selling off the several second amp third vacation homes   end result will be a big dump of supply of housing onto the market a supply that genx does not have the demographic numbers to consume and which it does not appear the frugal minded genx even want to buy at anything like the same rates the boomers did even if they were capable of paying the price which it also appears they can not having been in career amp salary gains by the bulge of boomers in positions above before them and then the echo boomers which while larger than x are not the equivalent of the original boomers and who are carrying an huge house sized debt load but minus the house and in many cases as debt which can not be erased as it is in student loan form from the beginning of their careers in which they are being paid significantly less than previous generations and who are delaying and then limiting the formation of households as a result   and that is just how demographic play out it was all entirely predictable and was in fact predicted by many

it sounds like you plan to sell sooner or later if your opinion is that there is still room for the housing market to grow make your bet and sell later the real estate market is much less liquid than other markets you might be invested in so if you do end up seeing trouble another housing crash you may be stuck with your investment for longer than you hoped i see more risk renting the house out but i do n't see significantly more reward if you are comfortable with the risk by all means proceed with your plan to rent   my opinion is contrary to many others here who think real estate investments are more desirable because the returns are less abstract you can collect the rent directly from your tenants but all investments are fraught with their own risks if you like putting in a little sweat equity doing your own repairs when things break at your rental renting may be a good match for you i prefer investments that do n't require as much attention and index funds certainly fit that bill for me

it could be a a way to preserve the value of your money but depends upon various factors if a country defaults and it leads to hyper inflation by definition that means that money loses its purchasing power   in even simpler terms it can not buy as much tomorrow as i could today therefore people can be to either hoard physical goods or other non perishable items real estate may well be such an item   if you are resident in the country you have to live somewhere   it is possible that a landlord might try to raise rent beyond what your job is willing to pay   of course in a house you might have a similar situation with utilities like electricity assuming some kind of re stabilization of the economy and currency even with several more zeros on the end it is conceivable that the house would subsequently sell for an appropriately inflation adjusted amount as other in demand physical goods may lots of variables good luck

gt company was incorporated which makes it a public institution and that changes things   people keep saying this but it simply is not true   no business is ever a public institution   even publicly traded companies are still privately   they are public only in the sense that they extend the opportunity to own a part of the company to the larger public   as this is true they incur certain responsibilities to be transparent in reporting their financials for example   but the idea that any private institution corporation church school or small business ought to be forced to hire on the basis of someone else 's idea of fairness is idiotic   it 's a fundamental matter of property rights   except in matters of fraud or force i should be free to dispose of my property say my business in any way i wish hiring serving or otherwise running that business as i see fit   if it is ok to force private sector institutions to hire and serve people because the government says so then by the same reasoning the government should be able to force you to invite certain classes of people to your dinner parties   even in the extreme cases of outright bigotry say the kkk member that owns a business and hates blacks or the muslim shop that hates jews this should not be prevented   however offensive i most of the rest of my fellow citizens find the or the they too have rights and privileges under our system and they too should not have those rights removed to suit my sense of fair play

just sticking to equities if you are investing directly in a share stock depending on various factors you may have picked up a winner or to your a loser say you just have rs 10,000/- to invest which stock would you buy    if you do n't know then it ’s better to buy a mutual fund now if you say you would buy a few of everything then even to purchase say rs worth of each stock in the nifty index 50 companies you would require at least an investment of when you are investing directly you always have to buy in whole numbers i.e. you ca n't buy 1/2 share or 1.6 share of some stock    the way mutual funds work is they take 10,000 from 250 people and invest in all the stocks there are fund managers who 's job is to pick good stocks however even they can not predict winners all the time normally a few of the picks become great winners most are average and a few are losers this means that overall your returns are average vs if you had picked the winning stock the essential difference between you investing on your own and via mutual funds are    it is good to begin with a mutual fund and once you start understanding the stocks better you can invest directly into the equities the same logic holds true for debt as well

how are shareholders sure to receive a fair percentage of each company   at the time the split occurs each investor owns the same proportion of each new company that they owned in the first   what the investor does with it after that selling one for example is irrelevant from a fairness perspective suppose company a splits into companies b and c.   you own enough stock to have 1 of a.   it splits   now you have a bunch of shares of b and c.   how much   well you have 1 of b and 1 of c.   what if all the profitable projects are in b   then shares of b will be worth more than those of c.   but it should be the case that the value of your shares of b plus the value of your shares of c are equal to the original value of your shares of a.   completely fair   in fact if the split was economically justified then b + c > a.   and the gains are realized proportionally by all equityholders remember when a stock splits every share splits so that everyone owns both companies in the same proportion as everyone else   executives do n't determine what the prices of the resulting companies are that is determined by the market   a fair market will value the child companies such that together they are worth what the original was

you are only 33 with plenty of time to generate long term returns a correction is an opportunity for you to buy more at a lower price my advice invest about half in an index fund s&p 500 for example and half in a target fund pick your retirement age keep saving regularly and in 30 years you 'll be very happy you did 5 10 k a month is fine until all of the money is invested you said this is a retirement account so invest the entire amount keep a rainy day fund in your non retirement savings you can fiddle around with how you invest the money and i 'm sure you 'll get variations on my answer my above suggestions may not be the absolute best option but they are certainly not the worst option given that you are very risk averse keep in mind that you are in this for the long term and should be investing in something where you can safely ignore short term downswings

for whatever it 's worth   judging from the comments in the other answers i think everyone is addressing your question how can you possibly lose money   there are a lot of ways to possibly lose money in the stock market   here are my thoughts   this is a chart of the s&p 500 from about 1996 to about 2012   at the top from the first arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 45   from the top of the second arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 52   it is really easy to look at our sustained bull market and feel   and while i 'll concede that not every company in the index fell over these two periods bear in mind that the s&p500 index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the united states and the entire index lost half it 's value twice   as the companies contained in the index shrink in value they were replaced by companies that are the new biggest 500 in the country then those fell too and so on and so forth until the entire index lost half value is a funny thing because it is n't necessarily tied to the performance of the business look at the current rosy valuations of all these non earnings tech companies   it could be that a company is still performing very well but there are just no buyers for the stock    so how can you lose money in the stock market   very easily   in a practical sense it 's when you need the money and can no longer weather the storm   people who went out for retirement around 2000 could n't sit around and wait until 2007 for their account values to be replenished   this is why you roll off your stock exposure as you age   as you get older you do n't have time and if you stop having income you can find yourself selling your assets at the least opportune time

because people are willing to trade for it   people are willing to trade for gold because the value of gold goes up because the demand for it goes up while the supply has been basically static or growing at a low static rate for a long time   the demand is going up because people see it as a safe place to put their money    another reason gold 's value in dollars goes up is because the value of the item it 's traded against dollars euros yen etc goes down while its own value stays roughly the same you point out gold is not as liquid as cash but gold both traded on an exchange and held physically is easily sold   there is always someone willing to trade you cash for gold   compare this to some of the bank stocks during the first part of our current recession   people were not willing to give much of anything for your shares   as the annoying misleading advertisements say gold has never been worth zero

in essence the problem that the op identified is not that the fx market itself has poor liquidity but that retail fx brokerage sometimes have poor counterparty risk management the problem is the actual business model that many fx brokerages have most fx brokerages are themselves customers of much larger money center banks that are very well capitalized and provide ample liquidity by liquidity i mean   the ability to put on a position of relatively decent size long eurusd say at any particular time with a small price impact relative to where it is trading for spot fx intraday bid ask spreads are extremely small on the order of fractions of pips for majors eur usd gbp jpy chf even in extremely volatile situations it rarely becomes much larger than a few pips for positions of 1 to 10 million usd equivalent notional value in the institutional market given that retail traders rarely trade that large a position the fx spot market is essentially very liquid in that respect the problem is that there are retail brokerages whose business model is to encourage excessive trading in the hopes of capturing that spread but not guaranteeing that it has enough capital to always meet all client obligations what does get retail traders in trouble is that most are unaware that they are not actually trading on an exchange like with stocks every bid and ask they see on the screen the moment they execute a trade is done against that fx brokerage and not some other trader in a transparent central limit order book this has some deep implications one is the nifty attribute that you rarely pay commission to do fx trades unlike in stock trading why because they build that cost into the quotes they give you in markets buyers and sellers cancel out they just capture that spread which is the desired outcome when that business model functions well   there are two situations where the brokerage 's might lose money and capital becomes very important in extremely volatile markets every one of their clients may want to sell for some reason this forces the fx brokers to accumulate a large position in the opposite side that they have to offload they will trade in the institutional market with other brokerages to net out their positions so that they are as close to flat as possible in the process since bid ask spreads in the institutional market is tighter than within their own brokerage by design they should still make money while not taking much risk however if they are not fast enough or if they do not have enough capital the brokerage 's position might move against them too quickly which may cause them lose all their capital and go belly up the brokerage is net flat but there are huge offsetting positions amongst its clients in the example of the swiss franc revaluation in early 2015 a sudden pop of 10 20 would have effectively meant that money in client accounts that were on the wrong side of the trade could not cover those on the other side when this happens it is theoretically the brokerage 's job to close out these positions before it wipes out the value of the client accounts however it would have been impossible to do so since there were no prices in between the instantaneous pop in which the brokerage could have terminated their client 's losing positions and offload the risk in the institutional market since it 's extremely hard to ask for more money than exist in the client accounts those with strong capital positions simply ate the loss such as oanda those that fared worse went belly up the irony here is that the more leverage the brokerage gave to their clients the less money would have been available to cover losses in such an event using an example to illustrate say client a is long 1 contract at $ 100 and client b is short 1 contract at $ 100 the brokerage is thus net flat if the brokerage had given 10:1 leverage then there would be $ 10 in each client 's account now instantaneously market moves down $ 10 client a loses $ 10 and client b is up $ 10 brokerage simply closes client a 's position gives $ 10 to client b. the brokerage is still long against client b however so now it has to go into the institutional market to be short 1 contract at $ 90 the brokerage again is net flat and no money actually goes in or out of the firm had the brokerage given 50:1 leverage however client a only has $ 2 in the account this would cause the brokerage close client a 's position the brokerage is still long against client b but has only $ 2 and would have to eat the loss for $ 8 to honor client b 's position and if it could not do that then it technically became insolvent since it owes more money to its clients than it has in assets this is exactly the reason there have been regulations in the us to limit the amount of leverage fx brokerages are allowed to offer to clients to assure the brokerage has enough capital to pay what is owed to clients

the reason i do n't want to get into here it is because internet debates over these things turn into an absolute shit show instantly    in a nutshell the sane parts of argument comes down to very difficult to prove assumptions about how perfectly fiat currency can will be implemented   the sane case for gold is that it is very difficult to get into the kind of money printing that places like zimbabwe and argentina have got into when your currency is based on something with a finite and slow growing supply it 's hard to print more gold    the sane case for fiat currency is that it is ridiculous to the entire economy by tying it to one arbitrary commodity with a fluctuating value and supply that does not correlate well with overall economic output    a perfectly implemented fiat currency printed and by a perfectly perfectly competent and perfectly benevolent central bank let 's call it god money is the ideal that 's pretty much axiomatic and even sane gold bugs would tend to allow the above so far as it goes including all stipulations    in fact someone inclined to believe in divine intervention might make a case that gold is precisely that a hard to forge easy to detect easy to handle metal placed on earth by god in quantities just right to serve as currency   the problem is that a really bad fiat currency is absolutely terrible leads to nightmare scenarios people starving on one side of a fence while tons of crops are being burned on the other side because of price discrepancies stuff like that again even sane keynesians will allow as much    the problem is that the crazies and single issue come out of the woodwork when you start getting into this stuff and tend to dominate the conversation if conversation is a fair word to use in a sense the sane spectrum of debate boils down to an almost ideological divide    whether you believe that a sort of permanent central bank currency issuer is possible plausible   because if it is achievable it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity if it is not achievable then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct however than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically motivated money printers i hope that makes sense and that it is a fair representation of the conundrum   the problem with making an argument is that you 've got a of technical and sometimes fairly complicated nitty gritty plus a certain amount of starting assumption worldview ideological stuff all together and almost all of it is very hard impossible to prove via scientific testing    both the technical and historical stuff have strong conflicting indicators and it 's obviously not possible to say set up two identical societies and let them run for a thousand years controlling for everything but monetary policy and see what happens    macro economics is a very imperfect science it has certainly given the world some very useful and valuable insights and axioms but the testing methods are extremely indirect and heavily subject to interpretation you really have only the historical record to draw on and it is almost impossible to find examples that control for whatever variable is in question    macro ideally tries really hard to be science but you 're always kind of picking from bad examples when testing a hypothesis trying to line up vaguely similar historical periods to isolate for some common factor it 's kind of like or theoretical physics except with much smaller and data sets ten thousand years from now it will be much easier to look at the historical data and isolate for particular variables over multiple hundred year spans across a variety of cultural political and socio economic backgrounds    for now the peanut gallery is full of questions that the experts can not answer and the record is full of exceptions to every rule and a lot of it frankly boils down to worldview and ideology with a healthy of i 'm smarter than you to finish the sauce    since i personally prefer technical questions to politics i will leave it to others to formulate and debate those things

obvious answer but the limit order should be set at the price that you are willing to pay more if you want a decent chance of the order filling in short notice you should place the order one price tick above the current highest buyer bid price as long as high frequency trading remains alive i would advise against ever using market orders these algorithmic trades can occasionally severely distort the price of a security in a fraction of a second so if your market order happens to fill in during such a distortion you might end up massively overpaying

pete b mentioned adjusting your payments using the debt snowball method and i agree it is one possible solution another being the debt avalanche method here is a link that describes both   there was a time in my past when i had 17 credit lines open totaling about $ 12,000 if i had paid them the way the banks asked minimum monthly payments it would have taken decades to pay off then i was shown these two techniques and as a result i was able pay them down rapidly and close all but 2 lines within 5 years like others i am going to say that if you already own your house free and clear never never never put a loan on it unless the loan is a to improve the house or b a life death emergency if you get sick or fired and miss even a single payment on a heloc you could lose your house forever and that just plain sucks not only will you then be forced into renting a place money down the drain but your credit rating will take such a huge hit it will be years if ever before you can even try and buy a new home   debts come and go as do the toys and other things we buy with that debt homes are security stability for tomorrow never give that up for a little ease comfort today update i had to go looking for it but here is some software that i used all those years ago to figure out my strategy for paying down all my credit bills it 's a bit clunky but it 's super easy to use plus it has some other variations on snowball and avalanche methods as well i definitely found it helpful

usually a financial advisor makes his money by selling financial investments   thus almost anyone you talk to is going to try to get you to be investment products which is not what you need to be doing at this point    you should be focusing on paying off all your debt first before doing any investment   the interest you are paying on credit cards is most likely much more than the money you could get from any type of investment   however once you have your consumer debt paid off i recommend talking to any friends co workers or other professional advisors you have such as attorneys or accountants   when you ask such people for the referrals find out how much debt they have how much they are investing   pay closer attention to those with a higher net worth otherwise you may be getting advice from someone fooled by the same sort of financial advisor you are trying to avoid

for a time period as short as a matter of months commercial paper or bonds about to mature are the highest returning investments as defined by benjamin graham   an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return operations not meeting these requirements are speculative there are no well known methods that can be applied to cryptocurrencies or forex for such short time periods to promise safety of principal the problem is that with $ 1,500 it will be impossible to buy any worthy credit directly and hold to maturity besides the need for liquidity eats up the return risk adjusted   the only alternative is a bond etf which has a high probability of getting crushed as interest rates continue to rise so that fails the above criteria the only alternative for investment now is a short term deposit with a bank for speculation anything goes the best strategy is to take the money and continue to build up a financial structure saving for risk adjusted and time discounted future annual cash flows   after the average unemployment cycle is funded approximately six or so years then long term investments should be accumulated internationally diversified equities

every car model type has a know interval when things need maintenance or replacement this info comes mainly from the manufacturer and the rental companies use these info to determine how long and at what rate a car should be rented i mean in total not rented to an individual this is easiest calculated with a long term rental 3 or 4 years time leasing business but is also used for short term rental   there is a point in time were a car gets to have more maintenance and replacements then before the rental company will always try to sell the car just before big replacements or maintenance are necessary of course your local mechanic can also now when those big events need to take place so he can know what to expect the next i 'm talking about foreseen replacements and maintenance like every x km replace drive belt replace oil i 'm not referring to the these latter are the risk the rental companies take during the rental period

the simple answer would be if you want to take euros from germany to spain as cash and deposit them you 're not breaking any laws there is nothing to declare to customs you 're still in the eu it is not income so there is nothing to tax and your bank should be able to receive it without issue no currency conversion after all it does however come with the risk of loss theft en route so it really depends on how comfortable you are walking around with that much on your person if you do n't want to carry that much around and your banks are imposing unreasonable fees here 's something you could investigate further i have not tested it myself transferwise offers a service that lets people send money to foreign accounts in different currencies for a small fee at mid market rates however they also offer a request money feature which allows eur eur transfers and some other same currency transfers so perhaps you could use this feature to simply request money from yourself the puts in how much they want to receive then they send a generated link to the other party when clicked that link sets up a transaction for the requested amount and sometimes a nominal fee i created a link for a gbp gbp transfer and it wanted 1 pound extra but when i did the same for eur eur it did n't want any extra i assume you would need two transferwise accounts though maybe not and i 'm not sure whether doing this is technically allowed in their terms of service so you should read those to be sure the advantage if this works is that neither bank sees it as a transfer rather the originating bank makes a payment to transferwise and then transferwise makes a deposit to the receiving account so i ca n't imagine either bank would be able to impose their foreign bank transfer fees for the transaction i have used transferwise for currency conversions but not the request money feature maybe other users could chime in if they have used it

first of all bear in mind that there 's no such thing as a risk free investment if you keep your money in the bank you 'll struggle to get a return that keeps up with inflation the same is true for other safe investments like government bonds gold and silver are essentially completely speculative investments over the years their price tends to vary quite wildly so unless you really understand how those markets work you should steer well clear they 're certainly not low risk repeatedly buying a property to sell in a couple of years time is almost certainly a bad idea you 'll end up paying substantial transaction fees each time that would wipe out a lot of the possible profit and of course there 's always the risk that prices would go down not up buying a property to keep and preferably live in might be a decent option once you have a good deposit saved up it 's very hard to say where prices will go in future on the one hand london prices are very high by historical standards but on the other hand supply is likely to remain severely constrained for years to come i tend to think of a house as something that i need one of for the rest of my life and so in one sense not owning a house to live in is a gamble that house prices and rents wo n't go up substantially if you own a house you 're insulated from changes in rent etc and even if prices crash at least you still have somewhere to live however that argument only works really well if you expect to keep living in the same area under most circumstances house prices might crash in your area but not elsewhere

yes you must file north carolina and south carolina income tax if you live in one state and work in another the income is potentially taxed twice most states give a credit for taxes paid to the other state often you pay the tax in the state where you worked and then if the tax rate in the state where you live is higher you pay the difference but the details depend on the tax laws of the two states involved i 'm not an expert on either carolina 's tax laws start by getting the forms and instructions from both states and see what they say or if you 're using tax software see if it handles this case if someone else on here knows the specifics of the tax laws for the i gladly yield many states establish reciprocity agreements with other states usually the neighboring states that generally say that if the state you live in and the state you work in are both party to the agreement then you only pay tax in the state you live in this simplifies things a lot unfortunately neither north carolina nor south carolina have such agreements with each other or with any other state

hopefully is a very good term    it remains a fact because in the current scenario of low growth companies do n't see much of a reason to invest and all evidence points agrees    so what are companies doing with all the extra cash they are getting from the rich they are either buying back their own shares which is a or they are doing mergers and buyouts which are both at record highs at the moment here too evidence points that neither of these are actual productive activities share buy backs only inflate the share price without actually changing the market cap as there are less shares in the market mergers have a strong track record of being expensive and ultimately bad investments that do more to erode value than they do to increase it    then of course there are the fees from the finance industry that are from these investments share buy backs and mergers that are just added into the spinning wheel without actually impacting the real economy

as someone that works in and with the ag and commodity markets my understanding is limited but i hope it helps    aside from needing an infrastructure built to maintain the vast amounts of data communication pricing banking information having a closing time for our markets helps to ensure value and fair trade capitalism is centralized around creating a fair value for ventures to sell where prospective buyers opt to purchase or invest for example where i attended university there were many coffee shops close to campus but only one stayed open all night and as such had operational cost much higher than other shops forcing them to charge more for a cup of coffee while this example is crude the idea is the same by hours product or strategies and developments meant to increase projected value are allowed to occur    i imagine that if the markets did not close my coffee prices would skyrocket for an increased demand that of which the supply and farmers would struggle to meet the same would be said of grain salt oils etcetera

reading financial statements is important in the sense that it gives you a picture of whether revenues and profits are growing or shrinking and what management thinks the future will look like the challenge is there are firms that make computers read filings for them and inform their trading strategy if the computer thinks the stock price is below the growth model it 's likely to bid the stock up and since it 's automated it 's moving it faster than you can open your web browser does this mean you should n't read them in a sense no the only sensible trading strategy is to assume you hold things for as long as their fundamentals exceed market value financial statements are where you find those fundamentals so you should read them but your question is is it worth it for investors my answer is no the market generally factors information in quickly and efficiently you 're better off sticking to passive mutual funds than trying to trade the better reason to learn to read these filings is to get a better sense of your employer potential employers competitors and even suppliers knowing what your margins are what your suppliers margins and acquisitions are and what they 're planning can inform your own decision making

gt you ca n't find anyone else who would pay you more or you would have left that 's a reflection of what you have to offer the world   your comment was thoughtful and this last bit in particular i feel is like something that i 've been wrestling with for a while    it 's a very libertarian view as you probably know it makes a lot of sense to me but i ca n't help to think of some possible flaws and wonder what you think   1 availability of work if somebody has a choice between no job and being grossly underpaid would n't the choice be between having no money and a little money at that point does n't that run the risk of exploitation would n't exploitation be working for less than what you 're worth   2 value unskilled pretty much means replaceable they do n't give a shit if you come or go and vice versa that 's not a reflection of a job 's worth to the company nor is a real reflection of how difficult it is there 's no competition for wages eventually workers get sick of it and leave not expecting improved wages elsewhere but a job they can deal with for 40 hours per week but there are always more people in need to take their place so the company has no incentive to raise wages     like you said it is a reflection of what you have to offer to the world in a sense that your skills are not uncommon however is this everything the world needs unskilled labor to run is there something wrong with being a cashier a a guy who the trucks that carry the things we all use no the world needs these people should people who are needed have jobs that do n't allow for them to meet basic living standards     3 expectation the only reason why most people wo n't work for less than 8 or 9 dollars hr expect reasonable flexibility to balance work and personal life do n't expect to be forced to work more than 8 9 hours per day have weekends off and those working 40 hrs week demand holiday pay sick days access to insurance vacation time is because that 's what people expect out of a job in this day and age none of these things are law i think people used to be treated considerably worse by their employers and likely there will be a time when people will think that the people of our day were stupid for settling for less the labor movement has done much in this regard   gt maybe instead of bitching that you are paid shit wages you should ask why you ever expected to earn more after failing to acquire any skill a teenager could n't master in a week    4 everyone 's solution let 's say everyone learns to do a skilled job who will be left to do the unskilled jobs someone will have to do them some countries have hordes of college educated workers working unskilled jobs because of the high that go to college ok so then leave it to merit does merit always work though what about nepotism personality when it does n't matter for the job age race sex ethnicity think these play any part in the hiring process    if all else fails not everyone can be expected to be a successful entrepreneur   5 life life can throw you some and people make mistakes some tend to pay for them more than others some have talent others do n't some are born with money some not some have a large and caring family others have no family at all     again i 'm not saying these things necessarily invalidate your original point but it 's something to consider your thoughts

there are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles price is not the only factor   this is an individual decision although interesting to examine from a macro perspective each vehicle purchase is made by an individual weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual based upon their specific needs and values i have purchased both new and used cars and i have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation read freakonomics to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you can not find a good used car the summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller and the lack of trust although much of economics assumes perfect market information margin profit comes from uncertainty or an imbalance of knowledge   buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people and you can not always trust the trading partner to be honest price the price or more precisely the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us larger than we might prefer that it be selection a buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle finding the color features and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder even impossible for the used buyer and once you have found the exact vehicle you want now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems and can be purchased at your price preference a buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new smells new is clean and does not have all the that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit this may include issues of pride image and status where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features reviews new vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers who can read about safety and reliability ratings learn about problems from the trade press and even price shop and compare between brands and models contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers unbalanced knowledge the seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle and thus much greater power in the negotiation process buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market and since many used cars are sold by dealers who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price fear risk many people want transportation and buying a used car comes with risk and that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that problems knowing that the car has not been abused that there are no hidden or problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage warranties new vehicles come with substantial warranties and this is another aspect of the fear risk point above a new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty you can purchase a used car warranty but they are expensive and often come with different problems finance terms a buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle and you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs own versus rent you are assuming that people actually want to own their cars and i would suggest that people want to own their car until it begins to present problems repair and maintenance issues and then they want a new vehicle to replace it but renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive and less flexible means to obtain transportation expense allocation a vehicle is an expense as the owner of a vehicle you are willing to pay for that expense to fill your need for transportation paying for the product as you use the product makes sense and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle capital allocation a buyer may need a vehicle either to commute to work school doctor or for work or business but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts credit cards loans the buyer may not have savings but be able to obtain financing to solve that need remember people need transportation and they are willing to pay to fill their need but they also have varying needs for all of the above factors and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals

the current stock price you 're referring to is actually the price of the last trade   it is a historical price but during market hours that 's usually mere seconds ago for very liquid stocks whereas the bid and ask are the best potential prices that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at the bid for the buying side and the ask for the selling side   but think of the bid and ask prices you see as tip of the iceberg prices   that is the bid is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $ for up to 200 shares   their bids are the highest currently bid and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices   so the bid you 're seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment   if you entered a market order to sell more than 200 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price the ask is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $ for up to 1000 shares   their ask prices are the lowest currently asked and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices   so the ask you 're seeing is the best asking price at that moment   if you entered a market order to buy more than 1000 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price a transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders note there are primarily two kinds of stock exchanges   the one i just described is a typical order driven matched bargain market and perhaps the kind you 're referring to the other kind is a quote driven over the counter market where there is a market maker as johnfx already mentioned   in those cases the spread between the bid ask goes to the market maker as compensation for making a market in a stock   for a liquid stock that is easy for the market maker to turn around and buy sell to somebody else the spread is small narrow   for illiquid stocks that are harder to deal in the spread is larger wide to compensate the market maker having to potentially carry the stock in inventory for some period of time during which there 's a risk to him if it moves in the wrong direction     finally if you wanted to buy 1000 shares you could enter a market order in which case as described above you 'll pay $   if you wanted to buy your shares at no more than $ instead i.e. the so called current price then you would enter a limit order for 1000 shares at $   and more to the point your order would become the new highest bid price until somebody else accepts your bid for their shares   of course there 's no guarantee that with a limit order that you will get filled your order could expire at the end of the day if nobody accepts your bid

what interests me in the article is the way california seems to be quite happy to be losing people who pay taxes because the state can so easily attract new warm bodies what happens to a state when there is no incentive to retain its people    it struck a cord with me because i 've been reading about the history of mining if an industry can always bring in newer poorer people conditions for those working in that industry will never rise in mining conditions can be so bad that you can almost think of it as if the workers are expendable working conditions can be so bad that many die each year and nobody seems to care because if one group of workers gets a little management simply starts importing them from another country    you can disagree but i see a parallel with california sure one is an industry and one is a country but this is a state that seems more than the rest of the country to depend on cheap mexican labor as mexico stopped breeding people for export california begin to simply import new slave labor from or any other place that still exports people as though they were only cattle of course this makes it difficult for those who came in an earlier wave to improve quality of life in fact life gets harder and just look at what happened to the world class famous free public education in california yeah distant memory now    i also wonder if allowing california to ignore national immigration law is good for the rest of the nation what about this quote   also more than 30 of the nation ’s welfare recipients are californians even though california has just 12 of the nation ’s population   it is not surprising therefore that california is ranked number one in poverty   california has so many electoral votes that i do n't expect to see them prosecuted by the federal government like az no matter what they do the state is too big to piss off but it is becoming a cancer to the rest of the nation

i 'm going to take a different path than the other answers given how low interest rates are depending on your credit buying a house may be a great strategy   however i would not put more than 20 down   putting more than 20 down unnecessarily ties up cash that could be used more productively elsewhere you need to figure out your cash flow situation both for the near term and for the long term for the short term you probably wo n't need to help your kids with tuition   they will likely be able to get a combination of grants scholarships and loans that will cover the cost   however the loans are generally not low interest and that is a huge amount of debt for someone so young   if you want to help pay your kids tuition you should at least budget that amount now for the long term without any retirement savings you may be hurting in a couple decades   since you also do n't have a home your living situation may be a problem   buying a home today may be the prudent move because that will hopefully be an appreciating asset and with a 30 year mortgage you 'll own it outright by 75 which takes a big strain off of retirement costs $ 1400 a month in bills apart from rent mortgage with no kids in the house is this correct sounds high   i would also recommend looking at your basic expenses and seeing what you can do without if you are cash strapped

should i use the profit to pay down student loans or just roll it into my next house in order to have a lower mortgage amount calculate the amount of interest in each scenario where the two scenarios are use extra cash to pay down student loans take out a full mortgage use extra cash to make a big down payment on the next house keep paying down student loans at normal rate in both scenarios the student loan rate will   stay the same however in the second scenario you may get a lower interest rate from making a larger down payment so then calculate the total interest resulting from each scenario student loan student loan balance = student loan interest   new mortgage mortgage balance = mortgage interest scenario 1 interest = student loan interest student loan loan balance = student loan interest   new mortgage rate with large down mortgage balance after large down payment = mortgage interest scenario 2 interest = student loan interest whichever scenario 's interest is lower will save money

if the federal reserve were to pay banks to hold money they would need to get the money from somewhere to do so   they would have three options go to congress and request and authorization of funds as an quasi independent entity however it would be both highly for an institution to diminish its own authority by requesting funding and politically difficult for the congress to appropriate it transfer held assets   after qe qe2 the fed is now the holder of several assets mortgages and the like that are already for it to hold it acquired these assets in the first place to soak up excess demand   if these assets were transferred back to banks it would have exactly the opposite effect increasing supply and further suppressing the value of the assets they would be trying to shore up by lowering the interest rate print money   the fed could raise the money supply by issuing new bonds this is inherently inflationary and while pretty much everyone agrees this is n't bad in the short run there is already widespread fear that in the long run qe by itself is going to unleash massive inflation once growth returns anyway   to keep pushing on this string would only these fears and quite likely turn it into a self prophecy in short the fed could pay banks to hold money but the political and economic consequences of raising the needed funds to do so would all undermine the institution or the desired effect

gt vouchers pay the private schools what the public school would have received in the first place the public school does n't pay as much in taxes and has a government supported administration that cuts waste at every chance so the private schools collect all the voucher money figure out they ca n't turn a profit and go bankrupt sending all the kids they had enrolled back to the public schools or forcing another issuance of another voucher costing the school system double to triple for every kid that gets screwed that way which means the public school system does n't have that money in their budget either forcing further cuts    i have never considered this before i can see the issue with it you 've changed my view on vouchers being a good system   it also causes self segregation at the schools because all the affluent parent can afford to drive their kids to another school poor kids need a bus that 's not covered by a voucher so we end up with schools that are 90 black hispanic with only 50 speaking english in a county that is 66 white while around the corner is a 90 white school where only 5 speak spanish when over 25 of the population does and that 's just the racial demographics that are immediately obvious the poverty levels are harder to get data on   i do n't consider this is necessarily a bad thing though if schools are self segregated it allows for teachers to teach in a certain way that is better for their demographic    school security officer bob on a power trip or the delinquent in the hall the problem is the same fearing for safety when there really should n't be a problem   you do n't get either of those at schools where there is almost no poverty you will have the same problem in canada if you move to a school district that has a significant amount of poverty   gt;and i get the feeling you do n't live near a population center   i do n't live in a big city but i live in a suburban area

the essential difference b n adr and a common share is that adr do not have voting rights common share has   there are some adr that would in certain conditions get converted to common stock but by and large most adr 's would remain adr 's without any voting rights if you are an individual investor this difference should not matter as rarely one would hold such a large number of shares to vote on general meeting on various issues the other difference is that since many countries have regulations on who can buy common shares for example in india an non resident can not directly buy any share hence he would buy adr thus adr would be priced more in the respective market if there is demand for example technologies an india company has adr on nyse this is more expensive around 1.5 times the price of the common share available in india at current exchange rate thus if you are able to invest with equal ease in hk have broker trading account etc consider the taxation of the gains in hk as well the tax treatment in us for overseas gains then its recommended that you go for common stock in hk else it would make sense to buy in us

avoiding fees would not be the primary reason to buy bonds yourself no the reason to buy bonds yourself in a retirement account is that you can hold them to maturity bond funds can and do lose value if interest rates rise and gain it if interest rates fall of course the same happens with the bond that you hold but you can hang on to it until maturity and get the face value out of it   that said it would take some effort to put together a decent bond portfolio especially if you were going to buy anything rated lower than the absolute best i think it 'd be fun to do but i 'm weird that way

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

i think the real answer to your question here is diversification   you have some fear of having your money in the market and rightfully so having all your money in one stock or even one type of mutual fund is risky as all get out and you could lose a lot of your money in such a stock market based investment   however the same logic works in your rental property   if you lose your and are unable to find a new one right away or if you have some very rare problem that insurance does n't cover your property could become very much not a break even investment very quickly   in reality there is n't any single investment you can make that has no risk   your assets need to be balanced between many different market investments that includes bonds us stocks european stocks cash etc   also investing in mutual funds instead of individual stocks greatly reduces your risk another thing to consider is the benefits of paying down debt   while investments have a risk of not performing if you pay off a loan with interest payments you definitely will save the money you would have paid in interest    to be specific i 'd recommend the following plan

this is a classic case of sunk cost fallacy the basic idea is this do n't look at how much you 've invested look at what the thing is worth it sounds like you are no longer able to keep up so the financial answer is to stop making repairs etc   the only question is whose name is on the deed if your coworker still owns the asset you can simply back out say the mobile home is yours any repairs and payments i made are yours too   basically you will be out all of your work and what you put into it but you 're not continuing to dig a hole your coworker should consider your investment as a gift but a gift that is no longer being made if in taking over the asset he put it in your name the asset is yours to do with as you please   it sounds like you should dispose of the asset even if its at a loss either way from a financial perspective the answer is to cut your losses and be done with it all of that is of course a strictly financial answer   reading between the lines it seems like you feel guilty about not being able to honor the commitment you have made   if there is a sentimental attachment to the mobile i would suggest discussing your situation with the coworker   that 's really not a financial consideration but that does n't mean its unimportant

the interest rate offered by a bond is called the nominal interest rate   the so called real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation if inflation is equal to or greater than the nominal rate at any given time the real interest rate is zero or negative we 're talking about a ten year bond it 's possible for the real interest rate to be negative for one or two years of the bond 's life and positive for eight or nine   on the other hand if we have a period of rising inflation as in the 1970s the inflation rate will exceed the original interest rate in most years meaning that the real interest rate on the ten year bond will be negative over its whole life people lost serious money on bonds and loans in the 1970s in such situations the borrowers make out that is they borrow money at low rates earn inflation plus a little more pay back inflated dollars and pocket the difference for them the money is free

it is not clear to me why you believe you can lose more than you put in without margin it is difficult and the chances are virtually nil however i can think of a few ways lets say you are an american and deposit $ 1000 now lets say you think the indian rupee is going to devalue relative to the euro so that means you want to go long going long without margin is still different than converting your into euros assume = 72 what s actually happening is your broker is taking out a 72,000 rupee loan and using it to buy euros with your $ 1000 acting as collateral you will need to pay interest on this loan about 7 annualized if i remember correctly you will earn interest on the euros you hold in the meantime for simplicity lets say its 1 the difference between interest you earn and interest you pay is called the cost of carry or commonly referred to as swap so your annualized cost of carry is $ 60 $ lets say you have this position open for 1 year and the exchange rate does nt move your total equity is $ now lets say an destroys all of europe your euros instantly become worthless you now must repay the rupee loan to close the trade the cost of which is $ 1000 but you only have $ in your account you have lost more than you deposited using no margin i would actually say that all buying and selling of currency pairs is inherently using margin because they all involve a short sale i do note that depending on your broker you can convert to another currency but that s not what forex traders do most of the time

as i 'm sure you are reading in hull 's classic the basic valuation of bonds depends on the chance of entity defaulting on those bonds   let 's start with just looking at the us   the united states has a big advantage over corporations in issuing debt as it also prints the same currency that the debt is denominated in   this makes it much easier not to default on your debt as you can always print more money to pay it   printing too much currency would cause inflation lowering the value of debt but this would also lower the value of us corporate debt as well   so you can think of even the highest rated corporate bonds as having the same rate as government debt plus a little extra due to the additional default risk of the corporation the situation with other aa rated governments is more complicated   most of those governments have debt denominated in their local currency as well so it may seem like they should all have similar rates   however some governments have higher and some actually have lower rates than the united states   now as above some of the difference is due to the possible need of printing too much currency to cover the debt in crisis and now that we have more than one country to invest in the extra risk of international money flowing out of the country 's bonds however the bigger difference between aa governments rates depends more on money flow central banks and regulation   bonds are still mostly freely traded instruments that respond to supply and demand but this supply and demand is heavily influenced by governments   central banks buy up large portions of the debt raising demand and lowering rates   regulators force banks to hold a certain amount of treasuries perhaps inflating demand finally to answer your question the united states has some interesting advantages partially just due to its long history of stability controlled inflation and large economy making treasuries valuable as one of the lowest risk investments   so its rates are generally on the low end but government manipulation can still mean that it is not necessarily the lowest

without going into minor details an fx transaction works essentially like this let 's assume you have sek 100 on your account if you buy 100 usd rub at 1.00 then that transaction creates a positive cash balance on your account of usd 100 and a negative cash balance an overdraft of rub 100 so right after the transaction assuming there is not transaction cost the net equity of your account is 100 sek + 100 usd 100 rub = 100 + 100 100 = 100 sek let 's say that the day after the rub has gone down by 10 and the rub 100 is now worth sek 90 only your new equity is 100 sek + 100 usd 100 rub = 100 + 100 90 = 110 sek and you 've made 10 congrats had you instead bought 100 sek rub the result would have been the same assuming the usd sek rate constant in practice the usd sek rate would probably not be constant and you would need to also account for in your example the usd rub has gone up 10 but the rub has gone down hence the result you find in my example the rub has gone down 10 i.e. the usd has gone up 11

investopedia explains how a stock split impacts the stock 's options each option contract is typically in control of 100 shares of an underlying security at a predetermined strike price to find the new coverage of the option take the split ratio and multiply by the old coverage normally 100 shares to find the new strike price take the old strike price and divide by the split ratio say for example you own a call for 100 shares of xyz with a strike price of $ 75 now if xyz had a stock split of 2 for 1 then the option would now be for 200 shares with a strike price of $ if on the other hand the stock split was 3 for 2 then the option would be for 150 shares with a strike price of $ 50 so yes a 2 for 1 stock split would halve the option strike prices   also in case the investopedia article is n't clear after a split the options still control 100 shares per contract regarding how a dividend affects option prices i found an article with a good explanation as mentioned above dividends payment could reduce the price of a stock due to reduction of the company 's assets it becomes intuitive to know that if a stock is expected to go down its call options will drop in extrinsic value while its put options will gain in extrinsic value before it happens indeed dividends deflate the extrinsic value of call options and inflate the extrinsic value of put options weeks or even months before an expected dividend payment   extrinsic value of call options are deflated due to dividends not only because of an expected reduction in the price of the stock but also due to the fact that call options buyers do not get paid the dividends that the stock buyers do this makes call options of dividend paying stocks less attractive to own than the stocks itself thereby depressing its extrinsic value how much the value of call options drop due to dividends is really a function of its in the money call options with high delta would be expected to drop the most on ex date while out of the money call options with lower delta would be least affected if a stock is expected to drop by a certain amount that drop would already have been priced into the extrinsic value of its put options way beforehand this is what happens to put options of dividend paying stocks this effect is again a function of options but this time in the money put options raise in extrinsic value more than out of the money put options this is because in the money put options with delta of close to -1 would gain almost dollar or dollar on the drop of a stock as such in the money put options would rise in extrinsic value almost as much as the dividend rate itself while out of the money put options may not experience any changes since the dividend effect may not be strong enough to bring the stock down to take those out of the money put options in the money so no a dividend of $ 1 will not necessarily decrease an option 's price by $ 1 on the ex dividend date   it depends on whether it 's a call or put option and whether the option is in the money or out of the money and by how much

can i apply for limited company now while fully time employed and not take any business until i get a contract some employment contracts may include non compete clauses or similar which expressly forbid you engaging in other employment or becoming self employed while simultaneously working for your current employer you may want to check this out before making any moves to register as a limited company you may forfeit long term benefits such as a pension you have built up at your present employer if they catch wind of a conflict of interest as noted in an earlier answer the setup process for a limited company is extremely simple in the uk so there is no reason you need to take these steps in advance of leaving your current employment during my resignation period scout for contracts should i wait weeks before actually deciding to search for contracts depending on the type of it work you intend to be contracting for you may find yourself shut out from major work if you are not vat registered it is a requirement to register for vat when you breach certain earnings limits see hmrc 's website but you can voluntarily register with hmrc before these limits if you wish being vat registered increases your bookkeeping and oversight requirements which makes you appear more attractive to larger enterprises corporations than a non vat registered firm it also suggests some degree of stability and a plan to stick around for the long haul this might be a catch-22 situation if you want to get noticed and land the sizable contracts you will almost certainly require a vat registration regardless of your overall yearly earnings it would be advisable to engage the services of a professional advisor before becoming vat registered but this and the subsequent professional advice you may require for putting in vat claims may not be a fee you wish to pay upfront if you are only attracting a small volume of work

if you place your emergency fund in your tfsa you can withdraw it at any time e.g. in an emergency and then replace the withdrawn money in the next calendar year be careful there you pay a hefty fine if you replace it in the current calendar year if this leads to an overcontribution it 's not an either or thing though you could invest the money in a mutual fund inside your tfsa i strongly recommend against this for your emergency fund however the whole point of an emergency fund is that you may need it immediately so keep it in an investment that you can liquidate quickly cash or very near cash while i obviously do n't know your specific situation i needed $ 10,000 within 24 hours and another $ 10,000 within two weeks during an emergency in a world where you have large sums of money you 'd max out your rrsp and tfsa with investments and keep your emergency fund outside of both but most of us are n't in that situation in that case it makes sense to use your tfsa for your emergency fund i use some of my tfsa space for my emergency fund savings account paying low interest though people often like gics and some for investment passive indexed stocks and bonds note that you need to pay taxes on your savings account interest too if held outside your tfsa and rrsp accounts

the forward curve for gold says little in my opinion about the expected price of gold the jan 16 price is 7.9 or so higher than the jan 12 price this reflects the current cost of money today 's low interest rates when the short rates were 5 the price 4 years out would be about 20 higher no magic there the site you linked to was in german so i looked and left i 'm certain if you pulled up the curve for platinum or silver it would have the identical shape that 7.9 rise over 4 years the yield curve on the other hand   is said to provide an indication of the direction of the economy a steep curve forecasting positive growth

tldr   yes you can that is quite a steep price to pay for a trade   i 've used tradeking previously which would charge you $ 5 for that same trade   some other brokers are more or less expensive and it is normally representative of the service one receives   one option would be scottrade   while they are much more expensive than tradeking they offer a much higher level of service   even at $ 17 a trade you 'll save a lot of money over the edward jones trade a big question here is who does your investing now   most people are pretty horrible at managing their own investments   some professional advice is probably in order   for most they discover this when their investments are small mitigating any mistakes made   you do n't have that luxury   i would highly recommend making sure you have people that can help you make good decisions the more i think about it the more i like the move to scottrade no affiliation or one like that charles schwab is another option   with scottrade you can go into a local branch and talk things over   i think they offer some professional management as well   schwab will offer the latter but not the former   however you can call them up and talk on the phone   another option is to go with fidelity and have them manage at least part of your money   of course you can always just do a professional independent money manager another option is to renegotiate with edward jones   something like   sorry but this is ridiculous you need to do much better or i am moving all my money   its much cheaper to charge you $ 100 for that same trade than lose the whole account

i 'm not the op but i 'm happy to give a brief overview   basically pre jobs act there were a lot of limits on who could make an equity investment in a non public company i.e. a startup or even a hedge fund there were some loopholes but basically you had to be an accredited investor an accredited investor was someone who either has made $ 200,000 + $ 300,000 + for married people for the past two years and expects to make that much again in the current year alternately they could have a net worth of $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence there was also a limit of 500 investors for a non public company before the company had to become public they did n't really have to ipo but they did have to file their financials with the sec so the effect was basically the same finally non public companies were prohibited from seeking investment through advertising basically they could n't take out an ad in a paper or event send a mass email and say hey we 're looking to raise a $ 1 million funding round contact us if you 're interested   okay now after the jobs act   the jobs act changed a the number and type of investors who could make equity investments in a non public company b the regulation of advertising for investments   post jobs private companies could have 2,000 shareholders and 500 of those could be unaccredited e.g. regular people like you and i the change in the number of shareholders is n't really that important because it 's just shareholders of record but that 's another post for another day there are still some requirements for unaccredited shareholder which i do n't remember off the top of my head i think you have to have income of at least $ 40k they also changed the solicitation ban so it 's possible that you might see an ad in the wsj someday for a startup company venture capital fund hedge fund etc   there are some other things it changed but imo those are the two most important

i think the question as worded has some incorrect assumptions built into it but let me try to hit the key answers that i think might help your broker ca n't really do anything here    your broker does n't own the calls you sold and ca n't elect to exercise someone else 's calls your broker can take action to liquidate positions when you are in margin calls but the scenario you describe would n't generate them   if you are long stock and short calls the calls are covered and have no margin requirement   the stock is the only collateral you need and you can have the position on in a cash non margin account    so assuming you have n't bought other things on margin that have gone south and are generating calls your broker has no right to do anything to you if you 're wondering about the other guy meaning the person who is long the calls that you are short they are the one who can impact you by exercising their right to buy the stock from you   in that scenario you make $ 21 your maximum possible return since you bought the stock at $ 100 collected $ 1 premium and sold it for $ 120   but they usually wo n't do that before expiration and they pretty definitely wo n't here   the reason they usually wo n't is that most options trade above their intrinsic value the amount that they 're in the money     in your example the options are n't in the money at all    the stock is trading at 120 and the option gives the owner the right to buy at 120 put another way exercising the option lets the owner buy the stock for the exact same price anyone with no options can in the market   so if the call has any value whatsoever exercising it is irrational the owner would be better off selling the call and buying the stock in the market

it can be pretty hard to compute the right number what you need to know for your actual return is called the dollar weighted return this is the internal rate of return irr computed for your actual cash flows so if you add $ 100 per month or whatever that has to be factored in if you have a separate account then hopefully your investment manager is computing this if you just have mutual funds at a brokerage or fund company computing it may be a bunch of manual labor unless the brokerage does it for you a site like morningstar will show a couple of return numbers on say an s&p500 index fund the first is time weighted and is just the raw return if you invested all money at time a and took it all out at time b. they also show investor return which is the average dollar weighted return for everyone who invested in the fund so if people sold the fund during a market crash that would lower the investor return this investor return shows actual returns for the average person which makes it more relevant in one way these were returns people actually received but less relevant in another the return is often lower because people are on average doing dumb stuff such as selling at market bottoms you could compare yourself to the time weighted return to see how you did vs. if you 'd bought and held with a big lump sum and you can compare yourself to the investor return to see how you did vs. actual irrational people .02 it is n't clear that either comparison matters so much after all the idea is to make adequate returns to meet your goals with minimum risk of not meeting your goals you ca n't spend beating the market or matching the market or anything else to the market in retirement you can only spend cash so beating a terrible market return wo n't make you feel better and beating a great market return is n't necessary i think it 's bad that many investment books and advisors frame things in terms of a market benchmark market benchmarks have their uses such as exposing index hugging active managers that are n't earning their fees but to me it 's easy to get mixed up and think the market benchmark is the point i feel the point is to achieve your financial goals

ultimately money derives its value from being spend on a good or service investing it is an act of denying your present self a good or service so that your future self can obtain hopefully more goods or services investing is a sensible and responsible default position but you clearly have passed the point at which the opportunity cost of the dollar not spent today is greater than its benefit in the future not all dollars are the same remember that money is a temporary store of value but you have to spend it to realize that value in your search learn about the psychology of money what are you saving it for how much do you want left over when you die if you die tomorrow will you regret not having spend a little more i 'm sorry to get morbid on you but saving for the future requires answering the question how long and it 's never forever this may be tangential but it shaped my behaviour towards money nonetheless frank on the psychology of time i would hazard a guess and say that you land in the future oriented camp

correcting keith 's answer you should have read about these details in the terms and conditions of your bank broker orders are like a soft limit order and meaningless without a validity which is typically between 1 and 5 days if you buy silver at an price above market price say x when the market offer is m then parts of your order will likely be filled at the market price   for the remaining quantity there is now a limit the bank broker might fill your order over the next 5 days or however long the validity is at various prices such that the overall average price does not exceed x. this is different to a limit order as it allows the bank broker to partially buy silver at higher prices than x as long as the overall averages is x or less   in a limit set up you might be partially filled at market prices first but if the market moves above x the bank broker will not fill any remaining quantities of your order so you might end up after a day or 5 days with a partially filled order also note that an price below the market price and with a short enough validity behaves like a limit price the 4th order type is sort of an opposite side limit price a stop buy means buy when the market offer quote goes above a certain price a stop sell means sell when the market bid quote goes below a certain price paired with the principle this might mean that you buy sell on average above below the price you give i do n't know how big your orders are or will be but always keep in mind that not all of your order might be filled immediately a so called partial fill   this is particularly noteworthy when you 're in a pro rata market

from my experience payments from banks and other financial entities such as loyalty programs generally are n't as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank thus keeping a bank account open simply for some reward loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons the more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ach payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services perhaps the biggest tell that you 're in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account   for example if you had a direct deposit to your bmo bank account make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account if you 're making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account you should n't need to move the auto loan but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account   some financial advisors such as in this bankrate article titled lenders can tap bank account for mortgage even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations if for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what 's in your checking account to avoid getting nickel and to death by payment processing fees i tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi annually thus consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months if so you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head it 's a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late if all that is in order close the account

this is a classic correlation does not imply causation situation   there are at least three issues at play in this question if you are or day trading then the first and second issues can definitely affect your trading   a higher price higher volume stock will have smaller percentage volatility fluctuations within a very small period of time however in general and especially when holding any position for any period of time during which unknowns can become known such as netflix 's customer loss announcement it is a mistake to feel safe based on price alone when considering longer term investments even weeks or months and if you were to compare penny stocks with blue chip stocks you still might find more stability in the higher value stocks   this is a correlation alone in other words a stable reliable stock probably has a relatively high price but a high price does not mean it 's reliable as joe said the stock of any company that is exposed to significant risks can drop or rise by large amounts suddenly and it is common for blue chip stocks to move significantly in a period of months as changes in the market or the company itself manifest themselves the last thing to remember when you are looking at raw dollar amounts is to remember to look at shares outstanding   netflix has a price of $ 79 to ford 's $ 12 yet ford has a larger market cap because there are nearly 4 billion shares compared to netflix 's 52 m

a handful of well known banks in the united states are part of the clearxchange network which allows customers of those banks to move money amongst them the clearxchange service is differently by each member bank for example chase calls it while wells fargo calls it surepay and capital one calls it p2p payments   to use clearxchange the sender 's bank must be part of the network the recipient is n't required to be in the network though if they are it makes things easier as no setup is required on the recipient 's end in that case otherwise they must sign up on the clearxchange site directly from what i can tell most payments are fee free within the network i have repeating payments set up with chase 's and they do not charge fees

it sounds for the most part you are a buy and hold type investor and continue to contribute monthly   i follow the same philosophy and continue to contribute monthly as well   i use as my online broker for trading it costs a penny per share with a minimum cost of $ 4.95 so if you only buy 100 shares you will still pay $ 4.95 up to a maximum of $ per trade so if you buy 10,000 shares you only pay $ three trades at $ 4.95 per month across the year would be $   this is assuming you are trading less then share each trade   so switching to questrade would save you an additional $ per year   multiply over number of year before you retire plus compound interest which could accrue and that can quite a bit of extra savings you pay nothing else to questrade either   no management fees etc   you manage the accounts

gt they want to lower the standards we have for goods and services   their goal is regulatory but its not being done in a good publications its an attempt to sneak through a huge long long of bad ideas that would not fly in any kind of light of day and then make them permanent with special eternal domestic legal process background for multinational corporations so permanent that future elections can not change them nor can states individually protect people their laws would be to the extent that unaccountable trade can order huge fines against countries and states for merely doing their sites default files case documents because they upon   new suddenly materialized rights as perceived by the trade agreements almost nobody knows they are doing this often countries do nt realize that they have lost their rights to determine their policies and then countries usually lose   there are so many problems i do n't know where to begin    gt in part by opening up public services to private business   privatization often goes badly they are hiding that and privatization as the only possible future    well at the beginning the ftas nafta and gats mandated the privatization of most public services in countries that signed them with services everything you ca n't drop on your foot especially some of the add on documents to gats that was in 1995 it contains a they all do   which said that countries could not change anything if it was a move back towards public ownership and control in the case of services they frame that as bad as a theft from businesses   so typically says things like they can not create any new public services and if there was any money involved in the market sector at all that it would have to be files in tiny steps no going back to public services allowed    but of course people do nt know that and often do n't believe it when told for example do you believe me when i tell you that s the reason us health care is so     can you see how and why they might lie about what they politicians can do can do about things because they want to win elections by promising things like affordable health but also hide the ugly act that they gave away the programs starting in 1995    the ftas that we can read the early ones tried to do it by being to non they are so complicated and ambiguous only a few people really know what they demanded at least up until recently now they are top secret really secret only the 600 lobbyists have access    now a growing number of people especially in europe seem to realize this is really scary and a red flag but its not because the news was any help its because of the net the media especially in the us has been completely unhelpful they do nt cover this at all ttip is a huge controversy but i have a feeling the worst one is tisa which has remained largely out of the news except for wikileaks and the financial services chapter just one chapter is known and its an old version   now they want in tisa to greatly expand the scope of these ftas to millions of service watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 in a huge number of countries countries want things like the us wants to be able to charge more money for drugs and they want to force other countries to allow us companies into their markets for example insurance or financial instruments it seems that they are trying to deregulate banking when it should be re regulated to avoid a repeat of the 2008 gfc another thing the us wants is to limit generic drugs and make it easier for companies to open factories send contractors etc elsewhere   its not always a good thing to open markets up to   in many cases it could lead to substantial job losses as it has in central america after america crisis belies empty

another way to delay receipt is to delay billing to be safe you will have to wait until the new year to send the bill because if you do it in late december they could be super efficient and send it to you with just a few days turn around they may being trying to spend money before the end of the year long ago there was a year where there were tax cuts starting january 1st   i new of companies who allowed their employees to defer receiving their december paychecks until january for families with two income this made a difference because they moved a month worth of one of their incomes into the cheaper year if they were n't living month to month they could easily absorb the delay of course if you already sent the invoice

at first i thought this might be too broad   there are of course thousands of things that you can do with your money to help the economy   but i think that there is room to discuss some broad strokes without trying to list a thousand details    regular investing as you are now helps the economy in that companies obtain money by selling their stock   they can then use that money to fund expansion etc   these things can help the economy permanently   of course they can also use the money to pay executive bonuses which do n't help the economy so much    similarly just spending money does not normally help the economy   unless we are in a recession it is mildly harmful to spend   money that could be going to support long term improvements in production instead is used to buy a luxury that does n't terribly interest you   i.e. if you do n't want a bigger house or a more luxurious car do n't buy it to stimulate the economy    many charitable donations have the same problem   they help short term consumption somewhere   and of course the charity starts asking you for more money   many charities waste most of a donation trying to get another one from the same person or family    sir john maynard keynes proposed that the best thing that people could do to help the economy is to invest in things that cause economic activity in turn   he was mostly talking about things like roads bridges and dams that are out of the investing range of most people so he wanted governments to do it particularly during a recession    so we are looking for ways to invest in durable improvements that will support economic activity in the future   a million dollars is a small amount for many things but there are some activities that work   i 'm going to list a few examples but there are certainly others    fund   basically loan your million dollars to people who need a small amount of money   these programs often allow you to determine the initial recipient and then that person determines the next recipient   a million dollars can finance hundreds if not thousands of these loans   they may be in the united states or in a developing country    set up a scholarship   my recommendation would be to find an existing scholarship with a few recipients and ask them to add one a year for the million dollars   a million dollars should typically produce about a scholarship a year in returns after inflation   of course that 's just regular inflation   education inflation is higher    solar prize   fund a program that gives out one solar installation every year or five to a family that owns a house is struggling to pay utilities and makes a compelling case   basically whenever the investment grows enough to support it make a new prize    buy something that will help other people make money    this is just six ideas off the top of my head   the goal here is to create something lasting that will promote economic activity   so a program that loans money forward   or a scholarship or free textbook particularly in a stem field   a small piece of infrastructure that helps people move around to work or spend their money   solar is a bit of a stretch here but it can be justified if you believe that an investment now is an investment in moving towards the future    the key thing here is to make your money do double duty   by spending your money during a recession or investing during the rest of the business cycle you can get some value for your money   but even better is if that spending has a societal return as well   scholarships and infrastructure do that   there is the immediate spending plus there is the effect of the spending   a business is established   a mind is trained and working at a high income job   people can move work and spend their own money

even though this is n't really personal finance related i still feel like there are some misconceptions here that could be addressed i do n't know where you got the phrase pass through insurance from   what you 're describing is a self funded plan   in a self funded arrangement an employer contracts a third party administrator tpa usually one of the big health insurance carriers to use it 's provider network process and claims etc   in addition to the tpa there will be some sort of stop loss insurance coverage on each participant   stop loss coverage usually provides a maximum amount of risk on a given member and on the entire population for a given month and/or year and/or lifetime   the employer 's risk is in between the plan deductible and the stop loss coverage assuming the stop loss does n't have a maximum almost all of the claim dollars in a given plan will come from very very few people   these costs typically arise out of very unforeseen diagnoses not chronic issues   a cancer patient can easily cost $ 1,000,000 in a year   someone 's diabetes maintenance medicine or other chronic maintenance will cost no where near what a surgery will in a year if we take a step back there are really four categories of employer insurance small group is tightly regulated   usually plan premiums are filed with a state authority there is no negotiating your group 's underwriting performance has zero impact on your premiums    employers have no way of obtaining any medical claim information on employees mid market is a pooled arrangement   the overall pool has a total increase and your particular group performs better or worse than the pool which may impact premiums   employers get very minor claims data things like the few highest claims or number of claims over a certain threshold but no employee specific information large group is a mostly arrangement   generally your group receives it 's own rating based on its individual underwriting performance   in general the carrier is some risk to a stop loss carrier and employer 's get a fair amount of insight in to claims though again not with employee names self funded is obviously self contained   the employer sets up a claims checking account   the tpa has draft authority on the account   the employee 's typically have no idea the plan is self funded their id cards will have the carrier logo and the carrier deals with them just as it would any other member   generally when a company is this size it has a separate benefits committee those few people will have some level of insight in to claims performance and stop loss activity   this committee will have nothing to do with the hiring process there are some new partially self funded arrangements which is just a really low threshold   and relatively expensive stop loss program that 's becoming somewhat popular in the mid market group size as employers attempt to reduce medical spend    i think when you start thinking on a micro single employee level you really lose sight of the big picture   why would an employer hire this guy who has this disease chronic problem that costs $ 50,000 per year   and logically you can get to the conclusion that with a self funded plan it literally costs the company the money so the company has an incentive not to hire the person   i understand the logic of the argument but at the self funded level the plan is typically costing north of half a million dollars each month   so a mid level hr hiring manager 1 is n't aware of specific plan claims or costs and is not part of the benefits executive committee 2 wo n't be instructed to screen for health deficiencies because it 's against the law 3 a company generally wo n't test the water here because $ 50,000 per year is less than 1 of the company 's annual medical expenses 4 $ 50,000 is well below the cost to litigate a discrimination law suit     really the flaw in your thought process is that $ 50,000 in annual medical expense is a lot   a harsh child birth can run in the $ 250,000 range so these companies never hire women   or never hire men who could add a spouse who 's in child bearing years   or never hire women who might have a female spouse who could be in child bearing years   a diagnosis will ratchet up $ 1,000,000 in a year   spend a bit of time in intensive care for $ 25,000 per day and you 're fired   a few thousand bucks on diabetes meds is n't anything relative to the annual cost of your average self funded plan the second flaw is that the hiring managers get insight in to specific claims   they do n't third you do n't hand over medical records on your resume anyway i typed this out in one single draft and have no intention of editing anything   i just wanted paint a broad picture i 'm sure things can be nit picked or focused on

i concur with the other answers about not mixing family and money the one whose loans are paid off second will be taking the credit risk of the other not paying being able to pay there may also be tax implications that said if you do still want to do this i think there 's a fairly straightforward way to account for the payments with your scenario your brother should make you a personal loan at some interest rate 5 and 10 that loan would be tracked independently of the actual student loans any money that your brother transfers to you to pay off your loans add to that personal loan and later on once your loans are paid off you start repaying the loan to him and he uses the proceeds for his own loans the interest rate will determine how the benefit of paying off the 10 loans is shared if the rate is set at 10 then your brother will get all the benefit if 5 you will get all the benefit and 7.5 would roughly share it out this means that you can still manage your own student loans separately your brother can choose how little or much to commit to the snowball rather than his own loans of course he should first make the minimum payments on his own loans anything he does loan you benefits you both if we ignore the credit and tax issues he gets more than the 5 interest on his own loans and you pay less than the 10 interest on your loans you 'll need to track the payments each way on this personal loan and apply interest to it every so often i 'd suggest monthly beware that the monthly equivalent of 5 annual interest is not because of compounding

while i totally agree with you talking to free market people you have to address it this way    their point is that they should pay what the market bears not what you want to make   that is fair     but that market has shown they need to pay more but they ca n't do it      roofing is a perfect example    charge $ 6000 for a roof materials cost $ 2000    labor costs $ 800    the rest is additional expenses and profit   even if you have to give your roofers a 25 raise that is $ 200   you are n't going out of business even if you have to absorb the increase and you ca n't tell me you ca n't raise your prices by $ 200 when your competitors are all over the board   i guarantee that if the cost of shingles go up the cost of a roof is raised no second thought    the problem is that they think their competitors are still paying the old rate   they are no longer competitive if they give a raise they are no longer competitive

the article is filled with terrible arguments    the entire point of corporate tax reform is to stop having a situation where startups and small businesses which are net job creators are paying 40 corporate tax rates whereas large established businesses which tend to be net job pay 6 effective tax rates due to the tax advantages of debt the author simply glosses over this and keeps repeating corporations already pay 20 and no new jobs are created    then the author also tries to point towards tax deals as evidence that tax reform is n't needed when that 's exactly why it is needed high corporate taxes result in a situation where large companies can lobby for lower taxes for themselves but smaller companies lacking political influence are stuck paying the high rates illinois is a great example of this phenomenon their corporate taxes are sky high so large companies just threaten to move every time they want lower taxes so you end up with the large company tax which may be like 2 and the small company tax which may be something like 8    overall it 's clear the author has absolutely no understanding whatsoever of the issues involved with corporate tax reform the us corporate tax system is terrible precisely because it rewards debt driven growth and cronyism while punishing real economic growth

the problem i have with gold is that it 's only worth what someone will pay you for it   to a degree that 's true with any equity but with a company there are other capital resources etc that provide a base value for the company and generally a business model that generates income gold just sits there it does n't make products it does n't perform services you ca n't eat it and the main people making money off of it are the folks charging a not commission to sell it to you or buy it back   sure it 's used in small quantities for things like plating electrical contacts dental work shielding etc but industrial uses account for only 10 of consumption   mostly it 's just hoarded either in the form of jewelry 50 or investment bullion coins 40   its value derives largely from rarity and other than the last few years there 's no track record of steady growth over time like the stock market or real estate just look at what gold prices did between 10 to 30 years ago i 'm not sure it came anywhere near close to keeping pace with inflation during that time   if you look at the chart you see a steady price until the us went off the gold standard in 1971 and rules regarding ownership and trading of gold were relaxed   there was a brief run up for a few years after that as the market found its level as it were and you really need to look from about 74 forward which it experienced its first test and demonstration of a supporting price around inflation adjusted   then the price fluctuated largely between 800 to 400 per ounce adjusted for inflation for the next 30 years other than a brief sympathetic silver tuesday spike due to the hunt brothers manipulation of silver prices in 1980   not sure if there is any causality but it is interesting to note that the recent in price starts in 2000 at almost the same time the last country the swiss went off the gold standard and gold was no longer tied to any currency or versa    if you bought in 75 as a hedge against inflation you were down as much as 50 during much of the next 33 years   if you managed to buy at a low the couple of times that gold was going down and found support around adjusted then you were on average up slightly as much as a little over 50 throwing out silver tuesday but then from about 98 through 05 had barely broken even   i personally view investments in gold at this time as a speculation   look at the history below and ask yourself if buying today would more likely end up as buying in 1972   or 1975 or gods forbid 1980   would you be taking advantage of a buying opportunity or piling onto a bubble and end up buying at the high   note from joe the article demand and supply adds to the discussion and supports chuck 's answer

from the irs section 1091 loss from wash sales of stock or securities   section provides that in the case of any loss claimed to have been sustained from any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where it appears that within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such sale or disposition and ending 30 days after such date the taxpayer has acquired by purchase or by an exchange on which the entire amount of gain or loss was recognized by has entered into a contract or option so to acquire substantially identical stock or 3 securities then no deduction shall be allowed under 165 the document is not long 4 pages and should be read to see the intent it 's tough to choose the one but the conclusion is this is the definitive response to that question   a purchase within an ira or other retirement account can create a wash sale if such a purchase would be a wash sale otherwise i.e. the fact that it 's a retirement account does n't avoid wash rules

tl;dr   sears is failing because the ceo is running the company into the ground for personal profit   there have been many many articles written on the issue   the ceo is having the stores sell their property at a discount to one of his other companies then having the stores pay rent   except boutique stores actually pay more money than sears does   so whenever a store closes his other company can rent the space out for almost double   oh and he encouraged a corporate culture where the department heads use those screen hospitals use to keep each other from spying on their laptops during meetings   the way it works some departments actually contract out to a 3rd party rather than going through corporate since it 's cheaper   yes departments individually have an it budget and are required to have their own contract to use in house it   it 's so bad that many employees say they are explicitly barred from helping another department   so customers feel and end up because there 's no one to help them or to run the register   that 's the power of a bad ceo that the board refuses to fire

your plan already answers your own question in the best possible way if you want to be able to make the most possible profit from a large downward move in a stock in this case a stock that tracks gold with a limited defined risk if there is an upward move the optimal strategy is to buy a put option   there are a few exchange traded funds etfs that track the price of gold   think of them as stocks that behave like gold essentially   two good examples that have options are gld and iau when you talk about gold you 'll hear a lot about futures   forget them for now   they do the same essential thing for your purposes but introduce more complexity than you need the way to profit from a downward move without protection against an upward move is by shorting the stock    shorting stock is like the opposite of buying it     you make the amount of money the stock goes down by or lose the amount it goes up by    but since stocks can go up by an infinite amount your possible loss is unlimited if you want to profit on a large downward move without an unlimited loss if you 're wrong and it goes up you need something that makes money as the stock drops but can only lose so much if it goes up    if you want to be guaranteed to lose nothing your best investment option is buying us treasuries and you 're technically still exposed to the risk that us defaults on its debt although if you 're a us resident you 'll likely have bigger problems than your portfolio in that situation buying a put option has the exact exposure you want    you pay a limited premium to buy it and at expiration you essentially make the full amount that the stock has declined below the strike price less what you paid for the option    that last part is important because you pay a premium for the option if it 's down just a little you might still lose some or all of what you paid for it which is what you give up in exchange for it limiting your maximum loss but wait you might say   when i buy an option i can lose all of my money ca nt i   yes you can     here 's the key to understanding the way options limit risk as compared to the corresponding way to get normal exposure through getting long or in your case short the stock if you use the number of options that represent the number of shares you would have bought you will have much much less total money at risk if you spend the same bag o cash on options as you would have spent on stock you will have exposure to way more shares and have the same amount of money at risk as if you bought the stock but will be much more likely to lose it the first way limits the total money at risk for a similar level of exposure the second way gets you exposure to a much larger amount of the stock for the same money increasing your risk so the best answer to your described need is already in the question    buy a put   i 'd probably look at gld to buy it on simply because it 's generally a little more liquid than iau and if you 're new to options consider the following paper trade first   either just keep track of fake buys and sells on a spreadsheet or use one of the many online services where you can track investments they do n't know or care if they 're real or not check out   they are an excellent learning resource that is n't trying to sell you anything their only reason to exist is to promote options education    if you do put on a trade do n't forget that the most frustrating pitfall with buying options is this   you can be basically right and still lose some or all of what you invest   this happens two ways so think about them both before you trade if the stock goes in the direction you think but not enough to make back your premium you can still lose   so you need to make sure you know how far down the stock has to be to make back your premium   at expiration it 's simple you need it to be below the strike price by more than what you paid for the option with options timing is everything   if the stock goes down a ton or even to zero free gold but only after your option expires you were essentially right but lose all your money   so while you do n't want to buy an option that 's longer than you need since the premium is higher if you 're not sure if an expiration is long enough out it is n't you need the next one edit to address update i 'm not sure not long enough was the problem here but if the question is just how to ensure there is a limited defined amount you can lose even if you want the possible loss to be much less than you can potentially make the put strategy described already does that if the stock you use is at $ 100 and you buy a put with a 100 strike for $ 5 you can make up to $ 95    this occurs if the stock goes to zero meaning you could buy it for nothing and sell it for $ 100 netting $ 95 after the $ 5 you paid    but you can only lose $ 5 so the put strategy covers you if the goal is to have no real risk of loss there 's no way to have any real gain above what 's sometimes called the risk free rate   for simplicity 's sake think of that as what you 'd get from us treasuries as mentioned above if the goal is to make money whether the stock or gold goes either up or down that 's possible but note that you still have a fairly high risk of loss which occurs if it fails to move either up or down by enough   that strategy in its most common form is called a straddle which basically means you buy a call and a put with the same strike price   using the same $ 100 example you could buy the calls for $ 5 and the puts for $ 5   now you 've spent $ 10 total and you make money if the stock is up or down by more than $ 10 at expiration over 110 or under 90    but if it 's between 90 and 100 you lose money as one of your options will be worthless and the other is worth less than the $ 10 total you paid for them both

for your base question yes   barring some major collapse of civilization event but in that case you 're screwed anyway   on the individual points 1 depends on whether you choose to invest in index type funds where profit is mainly expected from price appreciation or more value based investing   but either or a mix of the two my own choice should show returns above inflation over the long term 2 yes in the us anyway   you can invest a few hundred dollars at a time and with good companies like vanguard t. rowe price there are no transaction fees either for investing or for redeeming    3 long term it 's crash proof if you have the self discipline not to panic sell at market lows   in my case my total fund valuation dropped around 40 in 08   i did n't sell anything and in fact tried to cut spending and invest more and now i have nearly double what i had before the crash bottom line is that it has worked for me   after ~30 years of investing this way without being fanatic about it i have enough that i could live moderately without working for the rest of my life   not and this is where i part company with mmm and most of the fire community that i 'd ever want to actually retire   but my modest financial independence gives me the freedom to work at things i like rather than because i 'm worrying about paying bills

i kind of hate piling on with another opinion but this is too long for a comment i did what you are thinking of doing i would at least try renting it for a couple years so long as the primary risks of renting are mostly related to unexpected costs and bad tenants you 've got a very healthy income so as long as you maintain a nice emergency fund it does n't sound like keeping this property as a rental will be too much risk if the rental market is strong where your house is then you have a better chance of avoiding bad tenants i like to keep my rent a little lower than the max i think it could go for to attract more applications and hopefully find someone who will be a good longer term tenant tax free gains so long as you lived in your house 2 of the last 5 years you can sell without paying capital gains tax on your profit so you could try renting it for 2 years and then sell that was a key for me when i converted my first house to a rental i liked that flexibility there 's still the typical renting risks associated but it 's not a lifelong commitment you can get 2 years of increased equity appreciation tax free or you could find you enjoy it and keep it for the long haul

do some math figure out the net after tax money you 'd have if you left it taxable then look at the difference in effect you 'd pay $ x the tax now for $ y benefit the tax on the full benefit not paid   the math works similar to you buying a small policy on your own

i just briefly looked into the gravity battery and it looks like a pain in the neck engineering wise making that economically viable with the requirement to replace the installed base seems also it does n't seem to take care of one of the main issues transportation running electricity through wires is extremely inefficient because the wires have a certain amount of resistance so energy company try to minimize the amount of wires used by power plants for solar and wind which are efficiency is dependent on region transportation is the real issue for widespread adoption

the cost will be around $ if you do it correctly it in florida and can be over a $ 1,000 if you do it in new york new york is more expensive due to a publication requirement that new york has for llc ’s   the price ranges i ’ve given include filing state fees getting a tax id number ein operating agreement membership certificates registered agent fees and publication fees if done in new york each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there yearly paperwork to keep the llc running wo n’t be so expensive expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted   i had a quick look at florida and with someone filing it for you expect around $ 200 to $ 250 a year plus registered agent fees   if you are late in florida the penalty is $ 400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees in regards to bookkeeping and taxes yearly tax filing will start at $ 250 to $ 500 for an llc and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work   i recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge $ 250 to file an almost zero tax return on an llc   i think $ 40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are   i know in some major cities expect $ 75 an hour or higher so the expectation in miami and manhattan will probably be more expensive than and if you doing a little business do n’t expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping so breakdown $ fl $ 1,000 ny registration of llc + any business license city or other registrations $ 250 yearly fee + yearly registered agent + any business licenses city or other fee $ 500 tax return + bookkeeping fee banks will charge more than a personal account so expect $ 120 a year plus in regards to service i would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up   businesses in the us because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with us clients you are going to have some different needs based on not having a social security number or establishing from overseas

this particular topic has probably been beaten to death already   but from the other comments it seems that splitting finances them is a popular solution on this forum   i can see the individual benefit of this makes it easy to go buy whatever you want   but it can hurt too   what if the situation changes and you are no longer employed   your setup will cause stress because now you are having to ask your spouse to pay for everything   if this works for you congratulations   but fights may ensue divorce may follow i would like to offer an alternative   in my situation i bring home a paycheck while my wife does not   in this case each of us paying 50 would simply not work   not to say my wife does n't work she works her butt off cleaning house raising kids etc what we do is have any money that comes in go into a pot   we budget oh no the b word out regular expenses lights gas rent   anything that is n't allocated goes towards retirement savings in the us an ira is an individual retirement account or towards a war chest for big project such as home ownership   and each of us gets the same blow money allowance every week that we can do with as we please keep in mind using this mentality allows the possibility of me staying home at some point in the future when my wife goes back to her dream job   and there is no financial stress about whom owns what or who paid for what   we own it because we decided to pay for it

i 'm not a big fan of tax advantaged retirement accounts the rules on tax advantages accounts can change at any time   it 's already painful to get money out before retirement earnings or possibly contributions taxed as current income plus 10 penalty   the rules could get worse there 's also the assumption that your taxes will be lower when you retire   i think this is a poor assumption if you get free money from your employer for contribution to a 401(k contribute up to what will get you all of the free money you can   otherwise pay your taxes and keep control of your assets so short answer keep as much as you can out of tax advantaged accounts unless you 're turning down free money to do so

there are many ways to value a business here is a simple method to get a ball park number on most businesses this business is made of two parts for the real estate for the business   i would consider this type of small business riskier than the stock market and so you should expect a higher return maybe 15 or 20 if the rental business makes $ 50k profit not revenue and that is 20 return of your investment the business is worth $ 250k if the business makes no money or if they only make money because they do n't take a salary then this is a hobby and not a business there 's no business to buy here and you are just bidding on the real estate to do with what you please the assets worth $ 600k and the business worth $ 250k would be added together for a fair sale price of $ adjust for your actual numbers and you should be able to get a ball park of what you think the business is worth if you do the math and it works out that you 'll make 1 3 on your business compare that to investing in other places if it works out that you 'll make 40 on your money that 's pretty awesome too

there are number of reasons why someone does n't want to give you a receipt for cash payment anything ranging from not wanting to pay taxes to being able to deny you gave them money for service in the event you 're not happy with the service and ask for money back you wo n't get in trouble for giving him cash however you should be worried because any reputable person providing any type of service product will provide a receipt regardless of payment type

if this is your friend and he that convinced he will get rich from this then there 's really nothing you can do   you 've obviously done your best to explain the situation to him but he 's been caught up in their sales pitch and that 's more convincing to him i worked in sales for many years and the answers he gives you the one about not needing to know the details of how your smartphone works is a classic variation of typical objection handling that salespeople are taught proves that he has been sucked in by their scheme at this stage all you 're going to do is ruin your friendship with him if you continue to press the matter because he has made it clear he ca n't be convinced that this is anything other than legitimate   the reality is he is probably in too deep at this stage to just walk away from it so he has to convince himself that he made a wise choice schemes like this use a scarcity approach there 's only so much to go around and if you do n't get yours now then someone else will get it coupled with ego boosting boy mr. prospect this is such a great opportunity and you 're one of only a few who are sophisticated enough to understand and take advantage of it to get people to lower their guard and not ask a whole lot of probing questions nobody wants to feel stupid and they do n't want others to think they 're stupid so these schemes will present the information in such a way that ordinarily prudent questions come across as sounding dumb making the questioner seem not so smart   rather than walking away from it peoples pride will sometimes make them double down on it and they 'll just go along with it to come across as though they get it even when they really do n't the small payouts at early stages are a classic sign of a ponzi scheme   your friend will never listen to you as long as those little checks continue to come in because to him they 're absolute proof he 's right and you 're wrong   it 's those checks or payouts however they 're doing it that will make him step up his efforts to recruit other people into the scheme or worse yet invest more of his own money into this keep in mind that in the end you really have no power to do anything in this situation other than be his friend and try to use gentle persuasion   he 's already made it clear that he is n't going to listen to your explanations about why this is a scam for a couple reasons   first and probably greatest it would be an admission that he 's dumb or at least not as smart as you and who wants that   second he continues to get little checks that reinforce the fact this must be real or why else would he be getting this money   third he has already demonstrated his commitment to this by quitting his job so from his point of view this has become an all or nothing ticket to wealth    the bottom line is these schemes work because the sales pitch is powerful enough to overcome ordinary logic for people who think there just has to be an easy way to easy street all you can do is just be there as his friend and hope that he sees the light before the damage to himself and anyone else gets too great   you ca n't stop him from what he 's doing any more than you can stop the sun from rising as long the message and checks he 's getting from other people keep him convinced he 's on the right path edit after reading the comments posted in this thread i do want to amend my statements because many good points have been raised here   you obviously ca n't just sit by and do nothing while your friend talks others into taking the same or worse risks that he is   that 's not morally right by any measure at the same time however be very careful about how you go about this   your friend as you stated sounds pretty much like he 's all in with this scheme so there 's definitely going to be some serious emotional commitment to it on his part as well   anyone and everything that threatens what he sees as his ticket to easy street could easily become a target when this all comes crashing down as it inevitably will   you could very well be the cause of that in his eyes especially if he knows you 've been discouraging people from buying into this nightmare people are not rational creatures when it comes to money losses   it 's called costs where they 'll continue to chase their losses on the rationale they 'll make up for it if they just do n't give up   the more your friend committed to this the worse his about losing so he 'll do whatever he has to in order to save his position   this is what gamblers do and why the house does so well for itself some have suggested making anonymous flyers or other means of communicating that do n't expose you as the person spreading the message and that 's one suggestion   however the problem with this is that since the receiver has no idea who sent the message they 're not likely to give it the kind of credibility or notice that they would to something passed to them by a person they know and trust and your anonymous message will have little weight in the face of the persuasive pitch that got your friend to commit his own money and future another problem as you 've noted is that you do n't travel in the same circles as the people he 's likely to recruit so how would you go about warning them   how would they view their first contact with you when it comes with a message not to trust what someone else they already know is about to tell them   would they write it off as someone who 's   hard to tell another huge ploy of these schemes is that they tend to preemptively strike at what you propose doing that is warning people to stay away   they do this by projecting the people giving the warnings as losers who did n't see the opportunity for themselves and now want to keep others away from their own financial success   they 'll portray you as someone who is n't smart enough to see this huge opportunity and since you ca n't understand it you do n't think anyone else does either   they 'll point out that if you were so good with finances why are n't you already successful these guys are very good and they have an answer for every objection you can raise whether its to them or to someone else   they 've spent a long time honing their message which makes it difficult for anyone to say something persuasive enough to sway others away from being duped   this is a hard path no doubt i hope you are able to warn others away   just be aware that it may come at a cost to you as well and be prepared for what that might be i hope this helps good luck

there are some great tips and advice in here    here 's something you may not have considered the capacity for income is limited by your time and the tuk tuk rates   for example if you become the best and most well known tuk tuk driver in siam reap and all the tourist want to use your service the most business you can do is 1 customer per day    however if you were to make trusty tuk tuks a booking service you could make a margin from multiple drivers   heres how it works   you find 10 drivers who all agree to do the same features cold drinks and snacks curtains help tourists with tickets trusty tuk tuk business cards paint or decorate the tuk tuks so they all look the same all drivers agree that for every booking you bring them they will offer the same service and pay you 10    set up a stand at the market with someone that speaks english and take bookings tell your potential customers about the price the tuk tuks the cold drinks the help and what temples they can visit   soon trusty tuk tuks becomes a brand this way you are not limited to 1 tuk tuk and 1 customer a day   the key here is that all drivers must agree to the same price and the same service its the consistency that makes a brand

obviously there are many approaches i ’ll describe what we do and why we think it is successful i have seen many couples having disagreements and even divorce over money it seems that this is a typical reason to fight and sometimes fight badly the realization is that different people have different preferences what to spend their money on and if you are not rich it continuously leads to disagreements did you really need another pair of etc our solution is a weekly allowance first all our money goes into one pot and is considered equal many couples find that a difficult step but i never thought twice about it i trust my spouse and i share my life with her so why not my money from this we agree on an that is used to cover any non common cost this includes all clothing dining out buying things etc the amount was chosen to match about what we spent for those things anyway and then adjusted annually the main point is that there is no critique allowed about what this is spent on you can blow it all on shoes or buy books or wine and dine or gamble it away whatever we are doing this since 23 years now and we are very happy with the results we never have financial anymore disadvantages are the effort you need to keep track of it somehow either you use a separate credit card or hand it out in cash or have a complete accounting i do the latter because i want to regarding all other spend we use the accounting to plan ahead for at least a year on all cost and income that are expected and that shows us the available cash flow and where it might get tight it also shows you where the money goes and where you could cut if cutting is needed or wanted again there is some effort in collecting the data but it is worth it for us

before anything else pay down any debt at higher interest rates best guaranteed return on investment you can get what do you plan to use the money for when with how much advance planning how risk tolerant are you and how patient are you would you see a dip in an asset 's value as lost money or a buying opportunity a good financial advisor and i mean one who is only an advisor and not trying to sell you anything but their services can take answers of that sort and recommend a mix of investment types that will suit your needs knowing that balance you can the pick specific investments to suit i remain a fan of low fee index funds as a painless way to get good diversification with some small percentage for more active trading if you really want to invest the effort and are convinced you can beat the odds other answers here on the personal finance discussion go into this in detail so i do n't think it 's worth repeating here unless there 's something really unusual about your situation

gt;i take advantage of this distortion to offer to buy your gold for half its free market value   this is where i disagree the price you get actually is the market value if not you clearly do n't have the skills to be trading in gold and should immediately get out of that business    but let 's continue with your example where starvation is the only alternative the only thing preventing your death by starvation is the ability and willingness of david siegel to accept your offer in your example he has saved your life    ah but how did he come to be in a position to do so it took him many years of his life and he chose to forego many of life 's pleasures along the way to ultimately attain the ability to save your life suppose he had never done so perhaps you would have never ended up with gold as it would be worthless to you or you still would have acquired the gold and then just died    as far as the timeshare thing goes if people are willing to accept a vacation in exchange for allowing someone to attempt to sell them something i see nothing wrong with them doing so

is it true you have to file papers with the government in the us to    withdraw large sums of cash at your local bank branch it 's true that a currency transaction report ctr gets filed with fincen financial crimes enforcement network when you make a cash transaction in excess of $ 10,000 banks have systems that do this automatically so you do n't have to really do anything other than provide some tax info if not already on file with the bank the teller can flag your ctr if they think the transaction is suspicious but there should n't be a delay on the withdrawal unless the bank has to make arrangements to have enough cash on hand some people do n't like the idea of ctr 's being filed and therefore make multiple smaller withdrawals but that can be considered illegal structuring and can result in confiscated money

they immediately make money by charging you the initial fee   in the long term they make money because a surprisingly large number of customers do n't pay the balance off or otherwise violate the terms of the offer so that the rate applies    and sometimes depending on card policies they make money when the consumer makes new purchases on the card which accrue interest immediately at the rate while payments only go to paying down the 0 rate balance

considering i 'm in a nearly identical situation i 'll speak to my personal strategy and maybe there 's some value for you as well    you have in loans which you say you could pay off today   so what i read is that you 're sitting there with a $ 22k investment and want to know which investment to make pay down debt invest in yourself start up or some variation between those options   any investor worth his salt will ask a couple of questions what is my risk and what is my gain paying off your student loans offers no financial risk at the cost of opportunity risk and gains you returns of 3.4 6.8 3.4 4.5 and 6.8   those percentage gains are guaranteed and the opportunity risk is unknown investing in a startup is inherently risky with the potential for big payoffs but with this investment you are accepting a lot of risk for potentially some gain it could be the next apple it could also fail   so with your situation like mine i 'd say it 's best to accept the easy investment for now and fully vet out your tech start up idea in the meantime

no needed   the want to pretend this whole process is complicated so people like you do n't ask questions but that 's really it   there 's nothing more to it than that   they purchase bonds and other financial assets from the government and from their favorite banker friends with the money they just created presumably by pushing the up arrow on a dell keyboard lol   that 's it   then the major banks and the government all have more money   the idea being that it up credit   those banks will lend out more money to other banks and eventually to us   additionally the government will have more money to spend   it gives the illusion that something of worth was actually created   that 's the entire scheme   you still may have $ 1000 dollars but your $ 1000 is now a smaller percentage of the total amount of money out there so it buys less as prices increase to adjust for this new money

the shiller data is inflation adjusted in effect a flat line means that long term housing rises with inflation no more no less there 's no argument just the underlying data to support his charts this among them    as much as i respect nobel prize winning robert shiller his approach and analysis of the boom ignored interest rates say we look at a $ 50 k earning couple this is just below median income at 9 they qualify to borrow $ as rates fell to 4 they qualify for $ same fixed 30 term ignoring all other factors the swing in rates will generate an around the long term trend and my own data crunching suggests the equilibrium median home price will tend toward the price supported by the median income   a similar but not identical question why ca n't house prices be out of tune with salaries in response to ho 's comment i 'd imagine shiller understood the interest impact to clarify the chart as presented ignores it

some good answers already but let me add a tl dr version brokers work like a special type of bank account where you can deposit or withdraw money the major difference is that they also give you the ability to buy sell investments with the money in your account which you can do by either calling them or using their website important many investments you will make through a stocks are not insured against losing value like the money in your bank account

serious answer this would be a horrible idea for you so do n't do it   theoretical answer   this gets more complicated   if you are refusing to pay your student loans this is bad for the economy because you just destroyed the value associated with that payment   you essentially robbed the person holding the debt since you promised to pay it off     however you also stimulate the economy by buying goods   i 'm just an armchair economist but i would say that the detriment of not paying your debt is higher than the benefit of paying for the goods   now lets say you never say your not paying of your loans and instead just pay the minimum payment and buy the goods   now you are helping the economy because your debt is still generating money and you are injecting real money through your payment   so you essentially made more money for the economy   so long as the system believes you can pay of the debt the system is able to hold more money   this is actually why most credit companies want you to pay the minimum balance that and the interest earns them far more money than you borrowed

all lenders make money from loans despite the fact that there will be some defaults they just have to make enough money from those that do n't default to offset the losses from those that do so that their over all profit is good enough to be justified so there 's no reason the p2p lending companies ca n't protect your loan if you remove the risk of losing your investment you can expect your return to be reduced though as they have to take more profit away from you in order to fund the pool used to pay out when there is a default this does n't necessarily mean your money is completely safe though if the p2p lender itself went bust you would probably still lose your money unless it was appropriately insured i 'm not sure liquidity is really the right word really liquidity is about without serious penalty if you can transfer the debt to someone else at any time then liquidity is good but if you do n't really have that option as most lenders do n't then your investment amount whatever is n't paid back yet is completely illiquid still just for a shorter time i do n't see how the term is important myself there are many investments that have differing maturity time scales and you just have to pick one that has a suitable time scale return and risk for you 1 charge or not there is still an ultimate net return on investment secondary market or not virtually any investment has costs of some sort you just have to take them into account and make sure you do n't get fooled into thinking the roi is better than it seems because of the way they 've packaged and presented it

as others mentioned i am not sure what you mean by stating that your 401 k was rolled over to a money market account assuming that it was rolled over to an ira account you can roll it over to another ira account with a financial institution of your choice either a brokerage or a bank alternatively you can withdraw these funds but since you are under 59.5 years old you would have to cough up 10 penalty to irs for this unqualified withdrawal therefore i would strongly recommend for you to wait till you reach this eligible age other qualified penalty free withdrawals are purchase of the first home college tuition medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals disability and medical expenses exceeding 7.5 of your adjusted gross income i would assume that your 401 k was a traditional 401 k account before tax contributions and not roth 401 k so yo would also have to pay taxes upon withdrawing funds whether you do it now or after you are 59.5

there are no on line banks in israel there were various attempts to create something that would look like an online bank comes to mind did something similar recently but that essentially is a branch of a brick and mortar bank and respectively that allows you online management and phone service instead of walking into a branch not a replacement for a traditional bank thus there are no significant operational savings for the banks through which they could have afforded higher savings rates i agree with the other that the banking system in israel is very well regulated but i agree with you also it is not competitive at all that said at the current inflation rate and the current strength of the currency the that you have is actually pretty good israel has no interest in paying high rates on incoming money since its currency is too strong and it hurts exports so do n't expect much at home on this issue opening an account outside of israel poses a different problem tax reporting you 'll have to file an annual tax return and pay your taxes on the interest you earn something most israelis never have to do that will cost you and will probably eat up much if not all of the gain also currency fluctuations will hurt you as no one will open an account in outside of israel and you 'll have to convert back and forth in fact the first thing to happen when the rates in israel go up would be for the currency to go down so whatever you might gain abroad will disappear when you actually decide to move the money back and you will still be taxed on the interest income ca n't deduct capital loss from interest income your options as i see them are either the stock market or the bonds market or more likely a mix in israel the bonds similar to the us t bills short term bonds are called and you can either invest in them directly or through mutual funds these are traded at and can be held for free banks are not allowed to charge you for holding them they 're taxed at lower rates than capital gains 15 vs 25 during the times of low interest these may provide much better alternative than bank savings

no having to borrow money does not necessarily mean a company will have a hard time paying the interest on it similarly having to take out a mortgage on a house does not mean a person will not be able to make their mortgage payments borrowing money can be a way to spend future money instead of present money at a cost of course a company might not have all that money at the moment but that in no way implies they wo n't have it in the future and as you to in your question where you talk about funding some plans a company might be able to grow itself possibly increasing future profits by borrowing money

when i left the uk four years ago free banking is still an option and i 'm pretty sure it still is   therefore you have chosen to have a bank account with a charge    in return for this charge you will be eligible to receive certain benefits   for example reduced borrowing costs discounted mortgage rates free overdraft on small amounts rewards for paying household bills by direct debit and things of this sort    amongst these benefits may be preferential savings rates   however from hmrc 's point of view it will be the extra perks you are paying for with your monthly charge   you have chosen to pay for the account and hmrc is not interested in how you choose to spend your money only in the money you earn while i agree with you that it does have an element of unfairness the problem is how would you divide the cost amongst the various benefits

yes you should take in the expenses being incurred by the mutual fund this   lists down the fees charged by the mutual fund and where expenses can be found in the annual statement of the fund to calculate fees and expenses as you might expect fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a low cost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time you do n't pay expenses so the money is taken from the assets of the fund so you pay it indirectly if the expenses are huge that may point to something i.e. fund managers are enjoying at your expense money is being used somewhere else rather than being paid as dividends if the expenses are used in the growth of the fund that is a positive sign else you can expect the fund to be downgraded or upgraded by the credit rating agencies depending on how the credit rating agencies see the expenses of the fund and other factors generally comparison should be done with funds invested in the same sectors same distribution of assets so that you have a homogeneous comparison to make else it would be unwise to compare between a fund invested in oil companies and other in computers yes the economy is inter but that is not how a comparison should be done

i have a different perspective i believe the move to roth may be beneficial to a select few but not most people i coined the phrase as i believe that 's what 's happening a relatively uninformed move based on fear and not enough analysis   let 's look at a retiree today a couple has a $ standard deduction and 2 exemptions worth $ each this is $ they can withdraw tax free it would take pretax savings of $ k to support this withdrawal at   the 10 bracket is the next $ of taxable income or another $ k in assets to produce this annual withdrawal last for today the 15 bracket is the next $ which would require $ m to produce   the punchline today 's retiree couple can have over $ 2.1 m in pretax money this includes pension value if any of course and still be in the 15 bracket   if you ca n't deposit to a roth you are in the 28 bracket now or higher are you on track to have over $ 2 m in today 's dollars at retirement   one point that few mention is there are not just the two today 's tax rate vs retirement tax rate every year offers a situation where your income may drop a job loss a spouse staying home with a new child a disability a year back at school   these are the years that you might convert to roth just enough to fill your bracket back to your average prior rate e.g. convert to a taxable income of exactly $ and pay a marginal rate of 25   i 'll be the first to congratulate those who tell me they have a defined benefit pension that will replace their income to such a level that with their investments they are retiring at a higher income level than while working roth is the answer for them   roth is great for the 80 yr old woman i help 10 years ago i observed her marginal rate to be 15 and we convert just enough to put her at the top of that bracket this year $ 34,000 in taxable income this helps slow down the effect of her rmds required minimum distributions continuing to rise and potentially put her in the 25 bracket   so to be clear i 'm not anti roth i 'm just in favor of a thorough analysis and avoiding the roth for everyone mentality   edit i was asked by a financial writer kay bell to write on this very topic and appear on her site in a guest post roth iras and your retirement income it goes into greater detail than i could offer here tell kay joe sent you

during a stock split the only thing that changes is the number of shares outstanding   typically a stock splits to lower its price per share   sometimes if a company 's value is falling it will do a reverse split where x shares will be exchanged for y shares   this is typically done to avoid being de listed from an exchange if the price per share falls below a certain threshold usually $ 1   again the only thing changing is the number of shares outstanding   a 20 for 1 reverse split means for every 20 shares outstanding the shareholder will be granted one new share example x co. has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 100 per share   it does a 1 for 10 split   now there are 10,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 per share example y co has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 1 per share   it does a 10 for 1 reverse split   now there are 100,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 quickly looking at the news for it looks like it a 20 for 1 reverse split   you should probably look at your statements and ask your broker how the arithmetic worked in your case investopedia links for reverse stock split and stock split

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

thank you for this point   i 've worked on the front end of union shops as an engineer at several different places union workers can be incredibly short sighted lazy incompetent and act like asshole union leadership can often act as a agent that itself in between workers and management unions will often act in resistance to the implementation of necessary business practices and block forward progress   this is because management lets them   managers will often complain about how they wish their plants were n't unionized yet wo n't even stand up for their own rights that have been negotiated into the management side of the contract at the first sign of resistance they will fold and refuse to fight for what is necessary for the business they do n't engage the workers and leaders on the floor by just implementing policies with no input from the floor   any stupid fucking rule or unsustainable compensation that a union has negotiated has a management signature approving it   running a union shop can be difficult but it is no excuse for allowing it to harm the bottom line any time a plant needs to relocate to a right to work state represents just as much of a failure on management as it does labor

yes the distinction between how your funds are applied to principal vs interest is very important the interest amount charged each period probably monthly is not just one fixed sum calculated at the origination but rather is a dynamically calculated amount that changes each period relative to how much principal is remaining amount you owe   the picture you posted showing principal and interest assumes the payer always paid their minimum payment and never made any extra payments of principal take a look at the following graph and play around with the extra payment fields you will see some pretty drastic differences in the total interest paid green lines when extra payments are made

i do n't know about the us but in the uk this is common practice even required in some situations and not sketchy at all it 's perfectly legal saves you tax and protects you from a legal standpoint i.e. what if you break something and your employer wants to sue you this is what companies are for they are legal entities that are separate from an individual there is no requirement for a company to have more than one employee

in addition to the prior answer talking from experience you get into trouble if you surpass the contribution limit and your employer continues to deposit money above the irs maximum allowed when that happens you have until april to take out the excess contribution and earned interest on that chunk of money and included in your tax return or else you get a steep tax penalty in addition to being double taxed for the current and next tax year also from experience payroll departments will most likely get this wrong and it will end up in a compliance mess with you picking up the tab on your tax bill do n't let it happen

i contacted virgin money to ask if the prepaid card you mentioned offers a swift bic code and they gave me this response we do not have a swift or bic number for the virgin prepaid card you are unable to transfer funds from the prepaid card to another bank but you can set up a bank transfer to the prepaid card once you receive your card you can log onto your online account and you will have a form you can print off on the form you will have an account number sort code and a unique reference number for your bank to set up the transfer this may work for your purposes or it may not if you want more information about that specific card your best bet is to contact them and ask any other specific questions you have the same strategy should work for any prepaid card company just call or email them describe your situation and ask if their card will work

no they do not stock funds and bonds funds collect income dividends in different    ways stock funds collect dividends   as well as any capital gains    that are realized from the underlying stocks   and incorporates these    into the funds’ net asset value or daily share price that ’s why a    stock fund ’s share price drops when the fund makes a distribution    the distribution comes out of the fund ’s total net assets with bond funds the internal accounting is different   dividends    accrue daily and are then paid out to shareholders every month or    quarter   bond funds collect the income from the underlying bonds and    keep it in a separate internal bucket   a bond fund calculates a    daily accrual rate for the shares outstanding and shareholders only    earn income for the days they actually hold the fund   for example if    you buy a bond fund two days before the fund ’s month end distribution    you would only receive two worth of income that month   on the    other hand if you sell a fund part way through the month you will    still receive a partial distribution at the end of the month    pro rated for the days you actually held the fund source   also via bogleheads most vanguard bond funds accrue interest to the share holders daily    here is a typical statement from a prospectus each fund distributes to shareholders virtually all of its net income    interest less expenses as well as any net capital gains realized    from the sale of its holdings the fund ’s income dividends accrue    daily and are distributed monthly the term accrue used in this sense    means that the income dividends are credited to your account each day    just like interest in a savings account that accrues daily since the    money set aside for your dividends is both an asset of the fund and a    liability it does not affect the calculated net asset value when the    fund distributes the income dividends at the end of the month the net    asset value does not change as both the assets and liabilities    decrease by exactly the same amount note that if you sell all of    your bond fund shares in the middle of the month you will receive as    proceeds the value of your shares calculated as number of shares    times net asset value plus a separate distribution of the accrued    income dividends

just so you know the sec does n't have criminal authority they do civil fines   it 's the department of justice that sends white collar criminals to jail   if you 'd like to see what they 've been up to here 's a little info from the stats services publications financial crimes 2011   also i could be wrong but i think the government mass settled the claims coming from the financial collapse      edit you do n't get to keep the money you made from your illegal activity   that would just be stupid   the fines are on top of giving the money back   edit 2 remember these watch?v = = share   they did n't get to keep the money they stole   it 's no different in white collar crime

indeed you very are correct   i just did n't want to emphasize too much details as i could n't recall the video kinda wish i had a copy for reference i vaguely that while the labor may be more expensive than if they were to have done it in their homeland china they got tax incentives as it was a former furniture factory they hired most if not all of those workers from said factory and changed the factory too handle fridges and similar hardware while they had to ship sober back to their homeland china i think it was mentioned exporting here to there was cheaper and easier

ianal and nor am i an accountant so i ca n't give a definitive answer as to legality but afaik what you propose is legal   but what 's the benefit   avoiding corporation tax it 's simplistic and costly to think in terms like that you need to run the numbers for different scenarios and make a plan   you can end up ahead of the game precisely by choosing to pay some corporate tax each year really read on one of the many reasons that self employed canadians sometimes opt for a corporate structure over being a sole proprietor is to be able to not pay themselves everything the company earns each year this is especially important when a business has some really good years and others meh   using the corporation to retain earnings can be more tax effective example imagine your corporation earns net of accounting other non tax costs except for your draws $ for 5 years and $ 0 in year 6   assume the business is your only source of income for those 6 years   would you rather pay yourself the entire $ in years 1 5 then $ 0 in year 6 living off personal savings you hopefully accumulated earlier subjecting the $ to personal income tax only leaving nothing in the corporation to be taxed very roughly speaking assuming tax rates brackets are level from year to year and using this calculator which simplifies certain things then in ontario then you 'd net for years 1 5 and $ 0 in year 6 overall you realized $ drawing the income in this manner the average tax rate on the $ 600,000 was vs. pay yourself only $ in years 1 5 leaving $ subject to corporation tax assuming a 15.5 combined federal provincial corporate tax rate includes the small business deduction then the corp is left with $ to add to retained earnings in years 1 5 in year 6 the corp has $ in retained earnings to be distributed to you the sole owner as a dividend of the non eligible kind again very roughly speaking you 'd personally net $ in years 1 5 and then on the $ dividend in year 6 you 'd net $   overall you realized $   drawing the income in this manner the average tax rate on the $ 600 k was i.e. scenario 2 which spreads the income out over the six years saved in tax or $ smoothing out your income is also a prudent thing to do would you rather find yourself in year 6 having no clients and no revenue with nothing left to draw on or would you rather the company had saved money from the good years to pay you in the lean one

put your budget down on paper spreadsheet tool of choice e.g mint ynab excel   track every cent for a few months   seeing it written down makes the financial conversation easier   one simple trick is to pay yourself first   take $ 100 and sock it away each month or $ 25 per paycheck send it to another account where you wo n't see it   then live off the rest for food make a meal plan   eggs are healthy and relatively cheap so you have breakfast covered   is about $ 2 for a silos worth   worst case you can live off of ramen noodles peanut butter and tuna for a month while you catch up   cut everything as some of the others have answered you will be amazed how much you will not miss dave ramsey 's baby steps are great for getting started i disagree with dr on a great many things so that 's not advocating you sign up for anything ynab 's methodology is actually what got me out of my mess they have free classes in their website where budgeting is about planning and not simply tracking good luck
